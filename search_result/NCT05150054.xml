  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Women's Ischemic Syndrome Evaluation database, there are approximately 3 to&#xD;
      4 million women and men who present with signs and symptoms that are suggestive of myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia, however they have no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA). INOCA is defined&#xD;
      as patients presenting with signs or symptoms of ischemia but no obstructive artery disease.&#xD;
      Women are more likely than men to die from cardiovascular disease and more likely to present&#xD;
      with no obstructive coronary artery disease. Patients who present with signs and symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of INOCA/MINOCA are also presenting with Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD).&#xD;
      Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction is a dysfunction in the epicardial and/or microvascular&#xD;
      endothelial and/or nonendothelial that limits myocardial perfusion. Today, there is no&#xD;
      routinely offered/available noninvasive test that is used for the diagnosis of CMD,&#xD;
      significantly hindering the ability to identify the disease in the standard of care.&#xD;
      Magenetocardiography (MCG) has the opportunity to use its noninvasive imaging techniques to&#xD;
      provide early management of CMD. Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a noninvasive imaging modality&#xD;
      that has been extensively studied, over the past several decades, as a diagnostic imaging&#xD;
      solution for various forms of cardiovascular disease. MCG measures the magnetic field that&#xD;
      arises from the electrical activity of the heart's pacemaker activity, the very same activity&#xD;
      which yield surface electric field potentials as measured by the electrocardiogram. Since MCG&#xD;
      is a functional assessor of repolarization heterogeneity, it is hypothesized that MCG may be&#xD;
      a useful frontline diagnostic to identify INOCA and CMD in patients who would otherwise have&#xD;
      normal coronary CT angiograms and/or stress tests. The proposed study intends to study the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of MCG in this population, with the goal of providing early and&#xD;
      noninvasive insights for management of CMD.There will be a 6-month duration of the study&#xD;
      where the investigators propose to collect MCG scans from approximately 70 patients who&#xD;
      present to the Genetesis facility for a 15-minute CardioFlux scan appointment.&#xD;
