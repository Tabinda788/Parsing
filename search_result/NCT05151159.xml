  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of recent research on cervical cancer and its precancerous lesions have linked&#xD;
      the expression of IMP3 protein to cervical dysplasia and the possibility of severe cervical&#xD;
      dysplasia (CIN III) progressing to squamous cell carcinoma. A higher expression of IMP3&#xD;
      protein was found in the cytoplasms of severe cervical dysplasia (CIN III) cells and invasive&#xD;
      tumor cells compared to CIN I and CIN II change cells. The sensitivity of IMP3 expression in&#xD;
      tumor cells was 96%. In preparations that were IMP3 negative, no further monitoring and&#xD;
      treatment revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Further analyzes indicated the possibility of&#xD;
      determining IMP3 expression on first cervical biopsy specimens in patients with HSIL ( high&#xD;
      grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) lesions as a biomarker to detect a subset of patients&#xD;
      in whom lesion invasiveness can be expected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Molecular biomarkers could selectively identify patients with a more unfavorable clinical&#xD;
      course. One of these biomarkers is IMP3 - insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IGF group is a complex regulatory network at the cellular and substantial levels and&#xD;
      plays a key physiological role in the development of the organism and the maintenance of&#xD;
      normal cellular function during fetal and postnatal life. Overexpression of growth factors&#xD;
      and their receptors is a common event during carcinogenesis. The IGF signaling system is&#xD;
      under strict control of the normal physiological state and a deviation in this delicate&#xD;
      balance can be a trigger for many molecular events leading to the development of malignancy.&#xD;
      One member of the IGF system is the insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein (IMP)&#xD;
      which has been found to be an activator of IGF-II translation mRNA thus gaining a dominant&#xD;
      role in controlling IGF-II-dependent cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMP protein family contains 3 proteins (IMP1, IMP2, IMP3). IMP3 is normally expressed in&#xD;
      fetal tissues during embryogenesis. In adulthood, it appears as an oncoprotein that is&#xD;
      expressed only in tumor tissues without the presence in the surrounding (adjacent) benign&#xD;
      tissue. Previous in vitro studies have shown that IMP3 stimulates tumor cell proliferation by&#xD;
      activating IGF II translation and adhesion and invasion via adhesion molecules and matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of recent research on cervical cancer and its precancerous lesions have linked&#xD;
      the expression of IMP3 protein to cervical dysplasia and the possibility of severe cervical&#xD;
      dysplasia (CIN III) progressing to squamous cell carcinoma. A higher expression of IMP3&#xD;
      protein was found in the cytoplasms of severe cervical dysplasia (CIN III) cells and invasive&#xD;
      tumor cells compared to CIN I and CIN II change cells. The sensitivity of IMP3 expression in&#xD;
      tumor cells was 96%. In preparations that were IMP3 negative, no further monitoring and&#xD;
      treatment revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Further analyzes indicated the possibility of&#xD;
      determining IMP3 expression on first cervical biopsy specimens in patients with HSIL lesions&#xD;
      as a biomarker to detect a subset of patients in whom lesion invasiveness can be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, a monoclonal antibody specific for IMP3 has been developed and is&#xD;
      successfully used in routine immunohistochemical methods that study the expression of IMP3&#xD;
      proteins in various malignancies. It has recently been found that the expression of IMP3&#xD;
      protein is associated with a more aggressive clinical course and a less favorable outcome in&#xD;
      both gynecological and malignant diseases of other organ systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite previous knowledge of prevention, detection and treatment, cervical cancer still&#xD;
      causes great pain and mortality. The clinical course has so far been overlooked with regard&#xD;
      to the clinical and pathological stage of the disease, and based on histological parameters&#xD;
      and anatomical extent of the disease, a decision was made on further treatment and prognosis&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has only provided an introduction to the association of IMP3 protein&#xD;
      expression with cervical cancer. An association was found between the increased expression of&#xD;
      IMP3 protein in gynecological and other cancers in the body with a poorer disease outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would look at the expression of IMP3 protein in cervical squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      with the aim of detecting and linking the increased expression of IMP3 protein in patients&#xD;
      who are expected to have an unfavorable clinical course and a poorer prognosis. Only patients&#xD;
      in FIGO 1A1 and 1B1 disease stages will be observed, which has not been done in previous&#xD;
      studies. In this way, patients who would be treated surgically would be singled out, and in&#xD;
      whom a worse clinical outcome could be predicted and additional treatment could be planned&#xD;
      individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of research&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine the importance of immunohistochemical expression of IMP3 protein in&#xD;
      cervical squamous cell carcinoma as a prognostic factor associated with higher tumor&#xD;
      histological grade, higher FIGO stage, poorer course and disease outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasearch hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical expression of IMP3 protein in cervical squamous cell carcinoma was&#xD;
      associated with poorer clinical course and disease outcome, shorter disease-free interval&#xD;
      duration, and poorer 5-year survival outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical determination of IMP3 protein expression in cervical cancer - as a new&#xD;
      prognostic factor&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be excluded from the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients who have undergone pre-operative chemo and / or radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with associated gynecological or other malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with other histological types of tumors (adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous,&#xD;
           neuroendocrine, etc.) The research will be performed on pathohistological preparations&#xD;
           of surgical material of patients operated for cervical cancer in SKB Mostar in the above&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of IMP3 protein will be determined by immunohistochemical method and&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be used to assess the association of expression with clinical and&#xD;
      pathological disease progression and survival parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insight into medical documentation (patient medical histories and medical documentation of&#xD;
      oncology patients from the Department of Oncology and Gynecology Clinic SKB Mostar) will&#xD;
      provide clinical data on the age of patients, clinical stage of the disease determined by&#xD;
      FIGO classification criteria, recurrence / length of period without signs of disease and&#xD;
      clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor samples for analysis will be obtained by 4μ sections of archived paraffin blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mouse monoclonal antihuman antibodies an IMP3 (DAKO) at a dilution of 1: 100 will be used for&#xD;
      immunohistochemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunohistochemical process will begin by dewaxing the tissue first in xylene and then&#xD;
      rehydrating in alcohols of ever lower concentrations. Incubation in 0.1% H2O2 (30 minutes at&#xD;
      room temperature) inactivated endogenous peroxidase. In order to detect antigenic sites, the&#xD;
      sections will be boiled in citrate buffer, pH 9, in a microwave oven at 95 ° C for 10&#xD;
      minutes, then washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After cooling to room temperature,&#xD;
      the sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 60 minutes. After one hour of&#xD;
      incubation with the primary antibody and washing in PBS, secondary detection with&#xD;
      diaminobenzidine (DAB) will be used. An antibody-independent EnVision Detection Systems&#xD;
      Peroxidase (DAB, Rabbit / Mouse K 5007) will be used for this purpose. After a 30-minute&#xD;
      incubation and washing in PBS, the sections will be stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) for&#xD;
      10 minutes at room temperature and washed in distilled water, and stained with hemalaun. The&#xD;
      incisions will then be fitted into the fitting medium and covered with coverslips. Cells that&#xD;
      reacted with the appropriate primary antibodies should have stained cytoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of immunohistochemical staining will be interpreted semiquantitatively. Samples&#xD;
      with cytoplasmic staining in more than 10% of tumor cells will be considered as positive&#xD;
      expression, and will be classified into 5 categories: 0 (1% -10% of stained cells), 1 (11%&#xD;
      -25%), 2 (26% 50) %), 3 (51% -75%) and 4 (76% -100%). The intensity of IMP3 expression will&#xD;
      be classified as negative, weak, moderate, or severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sections intended for negative control by immunohistochemical staining of each antigen will&#xD;
      be subjected, along with other sections, to the same procedure, except that they will not&#xD;
      incubate with the primary antibody, but will be in PBS during that time. Control slides by&#xD;
      the manufacturer will be used as a positive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specimens will be examined with an Olympus BX40 light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total patient survival (OS) was defined as the time period between the date of surgery and&#xD;
      the date of the last clinical control or death from cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease-free interval (DFS) is defined as the time interval between the date of surgery and&#xD;
      the date of disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical data processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtained research results will be stored in the MS Excel 2007 database, for all&#xD;
      statistical analyzes the SPSS 17 statistical program will be used. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      methods will be used in data analysis. Nonparametric variables will be displayed as frequency&#xD;
      and percentage. Depending on the data distribution, the parametric variables will be&#xD;
      displayed as the arithmetic mean and standard deviation or as the median and interquartile&#xD;
      range. The data distribution will be tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A chi-square test&#xD;
      and Fisher's exact test will be used to test for differences between groups for categorical&#xD;
      variables where necessary. Student t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test as non-parametric alternatives in case the data&#xD;
      distribution deviates from normal will be used to test the difference between parametric&#xD;
      variables. Appropriate correlation and regression tests will be used to test the correlation&#xD;
      between the examined variables. In the analysis of survival and disease recurrence, the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox-Mantel log-rank test or the Mantel-Haenszel test will be used&#xD;
      depending on the data obtained. The probability level of p &lt;0.005 will be taken as&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
