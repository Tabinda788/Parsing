  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TEE has a definite effect on the evaluation of cardiac structure and function in&#xD;
      perioperative cardiac surgery. However, in CABG, previous studies on TEE mainly focused on&#xD;
      whether to change the surgical plan rather than improve the clinical prognosis. There are few&#xD;
      related studies on the evaluation of prognosis, and these studies have low efficacy and&#xD;
      inconsistent conclusions. Acute kidney injury is the most common complication of CABG surgery&#xD;
      and is independently associated with hospitalization and long-term mortality. In CABG&#xD;
      patients, acute kidney injury, in addition to operation-related factors, is closely related&#xD;
      to renal perfusion. These patients often exist serious coronary multivessel lesions and right&#xD;
      heart dysfunction, which can cause the system obstacle of regurgitation of the inferior vena&#xD;
      cava and kidney blood stasis, while the inappropriate rehydration fluid overload will affect&#xD;
      kidney blood perfusion, which may be one of the reasons for the kidney injury. Therefore,&#xD;
      appropriate volume status plays an important role in maintaining right heart function and&#xD;
      renal perfusion. What indicators can the investigators use to effectively evaluate the&#xD;
      patient's volume status and monitor the patient's right heart function?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, ultrasound has been used as an effective tool to assess patient volume&#xD;
      status , right heart function, and to guide patient fluid management. Many studies have&#xD;
      confirmed that the respiratory variability of inferior vena cava diameter (ΔIVC) measured by&#xD;
      TTE has a good correlation with the volume status of patients on mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      which has a high diagnostic value for predicting the fluid responsiveness and guiding fluid&#xD;
      management.However, no study has been reported using TEE measurements of ΔIVC to assess&#xD;
      volume status and guide fluid management in patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery.&#xD;
      Previous studies have confirmed that TAPSE measured by TTE is independently associated with&#xD;
      AKI in ICU patients and can predict the occurrence of AKI in such patients. However, TAPSE&#xD;
      monitored by TEE have not been reported in this regard. Can ΔIVC and TAPSE predict the&#xD;
      incidence of AKI and major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events in CABG&#xD;
      patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators designed this observational study to further scientifically&#xD;
      confirm the validity and guiding significance of ΔIVC and TAPSE in CABG, so as to protect and&#xD;
      improve patients' renal function , reduce postoperative mortality and improve the clinical&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
