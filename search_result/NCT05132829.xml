    <textblock>
      Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is effective against bacteria that been associated with&#xD;
      preterm birth (PTB). The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of azithromycin&#xD;
      prior to exam indicated cerclage prolongs gestation. A cerclage is a suture placed in the&#xD;
      cervix to prolong gestation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) continues to be a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The&#xD;
      rate of spontaneous PTB (delivery before 37 weeks gestation) is one in ten pregnancies and a&#xD;
      history of prior preterm birth remains a risk factor for recurrence. The pathophysiology of&#xD;
      cervical insufficiency leading to PTB remains poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While interventions for PTB prevention are limited, the American College of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology (ACOG) supports the use of cervical cerclage. A physical exam indicated cerclage&#xD;
      may be placed in the setting of painless cervical dilation in the second trimester. The&#xD;
      cerclage is believed to provide mechanical support to a weakened cervix and promote the&#xD;
      cervical mucosal plug as a barrier to ascending infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many aspects of cerclage use have been extensively studied, the use of antibiotics&#xD;
      prior to placement remains under evaluated. While antibiotic use is recommended during&#xD;
      cesarean section, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and obstetric anal&#xD;
      sphincter injuries (OASIS), ACOG currently does not recommend perioperative antibiotics or&#xD;
      prophylactic tocolytics at the time of cerclage placement citing insufficient evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miller et al. performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) showing an increased incidence of&#xD;
      pregnancy prolongation by at least 28 days among women who received indomethacin and&#xD;
      perioperative antibiotics in the setting of an exam indicated cerclage compared to those who&#xD;
      received no perioperative medications (92.3% vs 62.5%, p=0.01). Participants in the&#xD;
      experimental arm received cefazolin or clindamycin if they had a penicillin allergy.&#xD;
      Cefazolin is a first generation cephalosporin that has activity against gram positive cocci&#xD;
      and gram negative rods and is commonly used for surgical prophylaxis. Clindamycin is a&#xD;
      protein synthesis inhibitor and covers gram positive organisms and anaerobic bacteria, making&#xD;
      it an appropriate alternative in cases of penicillin allergy. The use of cefazolin&#xD;
      specifically with indomethacin has been studied retrospectively and showed a significant&#xD;
      improvement in gestational latency (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.21, 95% CI 1.05-1.40) and&#xD;
      birth weight (+489.8 grams, 95% CI 64.6-915.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of prolonged azithromycin with cerclage has been studied in a prospective, non-&#xD;
      randomized fashion. In this study, patients were given 500mg azithromycin for 3 days and this&#xD;
      was repeated every 10 days until 34 weeks. Patients who received this regimen and a cerclage&#xD;
      had lower PTB (65.7% vs 5.7%, p&lt;0.001) and reduced immediate fetal mortality (37.1% vs 0%,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to determine if the addition of azithromycin prior to exam indicated&#xD;
      cerclage prolongs gestation. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that binds to the 50S&#xD;
      subunit of the bacterial ribosome and inhibits transpeptidation. It is effective against a&#xD;
      wide variety of bacteria, specifically mycoplasma which has been associated with preterm&#xD;
      birth. Azithromycin is currently used in obstetrics for patients undergoing nonelective&#xD;
      cesarean delivery and as part of latency antibiotics in the setting of PPROM.&#xD;
