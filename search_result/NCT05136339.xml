    <measure>Change in &quot;Life's Simple 7&quot; Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adapted from the American Heart Association standards based on health assessment data. Point values are assigned to each component: 2 points for ideal, 1 point for intermediate, 0 points for poor. The total sum allows for a continuous measure of cardiovascular health ranging from poor to ideal (0-14 points). The final score will be categorized as 0-6 (poor), 7-8 (intermediate), 9-14 (ideal).</description>
