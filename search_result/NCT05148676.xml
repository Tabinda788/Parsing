  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There remains scarcity of literature regarding the patient's health status post-COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. This study analyzes the prevalence of residual symptoms and quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      after COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An anonymous online survey was administrated in Pakistan from November 2020 to April 2021 in&#xD;
      COVID-19 survivors. The questionnaire used the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) to&#xD;
      assess mental and physical QoL. Multivariate linear regression was used to explore factors&#xD;
      associated with mental and physical QoL scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 331 COVID-19 survivors participated in our survey. Around 42.0% of the cohort&#xD;
      reported within 1-3 months of diagnosis of COVID-19. The common residual symptoms were body&#xD;
      aches (39.9%), low mood (32.6%), and cough (30.2%). Better physical QoL was associated with&#xD;
      being male (adjusted beta: 3.328) and having no residual symptoms (6.955). However, suffering&#xD;
      from nausea/vomiting during initial COVID-19 infection (-4.026), being admitted to the ICU&#xD;
      during COVID-19 infection (-9.164), and suffering from residual body aches (-5.209) and low&#xD;
      mood (-2.959) was associated with poorer QoL. Better mental QoL was associated with being&#xD;
      asymptomatic during initial COVID-19 infection (6.149) and post-COVID (6.685), while&#xD;
      experiencing low mood post-COVID was associated with poorer mental QoL (-8.253 [-10.914,&#xD;
      -5.592]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite presumed &quot;recovery&quot; from COVID-19, patients still face a wide range of residual&#xD;
      symptoms months after initial infection, which contributes towards poorer QoL. Healthcare&#xD;
      professionals must remain alert to the long-lasting effects of COVID-19 infection and aim to&#xD;
      address them appropriately to improve patients' QoL.&#xD;
