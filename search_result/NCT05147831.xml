      The use of imaging is increasing in clinical practice, either for diagnosis or intervention.&#xD;
      In these imaging processes, contrast medium (CM) is widely used. However, CM administration&#xD;
      can induce contrast-induced nephropathy (CI-AKI). CI-AKI is the third most common cause of&#xD;
      renal insufficiency, and its incidence varies from 2% to 50% depending on patient risk&#xD;
      factors; in addition, studies have shown that CI-AKI occurs in 2% to 25% of patients&#xD;
      undergoing coronary intervention. CI-AKI is associated with significant mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity in patients undergoing coronary angiography or other diagnostic contrast studies.&#xD;
      We assessed the latest promising evidence on the ability of remote ischemic preconditioning&#xD;
      (RIPC) to reduce the incidence of CI-AKI in patients undergoing Coronary Angiogram (CA) or&#xD;
      diagnostic contrast studies such as CT angiogram, while at the same time being a&#xD;
      non-invasive, low cost, easy, and safe method with absence of adverse effects. However, more&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these preliminary results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to minimize the incidence of CI-AKI at the University of Texas&#xD;
      Medical Branch (UTMB). If found to be an effective method, RIPC would help minimize the&#xD;
      incidence of CI-AKI in all institutions across the globe, who would adopt this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective: i) reduce the rise in creatinine to &lt; 0.5 mg/dL post-CA in moderate to&#xD;
      high risk patients and ii) reduce the incidence of renal replacement therapy post-CA in&#xD;
      moderate to high risk patients; iii) we also aim to establish that RIPC is safe and&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the use of RIPC, when added to standard medical therapy (pre-and post-CA&#xD;
      hydration), will mitigate the effects of contrast on the renal vasculature and lessen the&#xD;
      incidence of CI-AKI in moderate to high risk patients at the University of Texas Medical&#xD;
      Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of iodinated contrast to visually enhance target vasculature is a widely used&#xD;
      diagnostic technique that is performed daily at UTMB, and around the world, for the diagnosis&#xD;
      and management of a variety of conditions. A common complication of this procedure is acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI), generally referred to as contrast-induced nephropathy (CI-AKI). This&#xD;
      complication can range from an isolated rise in serum creatinine to severe renal dysfunction&#xD;
      necessitating renal replacement therapy. The incidence of CI-AKI has been reported as&#xD;
      approximately 2-50%, depending upon the definition and sensitivity of assay employed to&#xD;
      assess GFR in the hospital setting. In addition, CI-AKI is associated with significant&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. If proven to be beneficial, RIPC will bring about a reduction in&#xD;
      incidence of CI-AKI, and thus help to reduce hospitalization and mortality from renal&#xD;
      etiology following a given contrast procedure.&#xD;

      Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of iodinated contrast to visually enhance target vasculature is a widely used&#xD;
      diagnostic technique that is performed daily at UTMB, and around the world, for the diagnosis&#xD;
      and management of a variety of conditions. A common complication of this procedure is acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI), generally referred to as contrast-induced nephropathy (CI-AKI). This&#xD;
      complication can range from an isolated rise in serum creatinine to severe renal dysfunction&#xD;
      necessitating renal replacement therapy. The incidence of CI-AKI has been reported as&#xD;
      approximately 2-50%, depending upon the definition and sensitivity of assay employed to&#xD;
      assess GFR in the hospital setting. In addition, CI-AKI is associated with significant&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. If proven to be beneficial, RIPC will bring about a reduction in&#xD;
      incidence of CI-AKI, and thus help to reduce hospitalization and mortality from renal&#xD;
      etiology following a given contrast procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for CI-AKI include age &gt; 75, hypotension, CHF, anemia, diabetes, patients with a&#xD;
      baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg /dL and the volume of contrast media used. The&#xD;
      presence of underlying renal dysfunction appears to provide particular susceptibility.&#xD;
      Although most studies exclude patients with severe renal dysfunction, Rihal et al. report&#xD;
      that in patients with a creatinine &gt;3.0 (and GFR &lt; 30) the incidence of CI-AKI was 31%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, robust strategies to prevent CI-AKI are minimal. Research has examined the use&#xD;
      of sodium bicarbonate, adding N-acetylcysteine or holding RAAS (Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      system) blockers but found all these three strategies ineffective. At this time the only&#xD;
      validated strategy to prevent CI-AKI is the use of fluid administration to ensure adequate&#xD;
      renal perfusion. Pre- and post-procedure intravenous fluid administration is currently&#xD;
      considered standard of care. In one study involving 408 patients with intact renal function&#xD;
      receiving isotonic saline (NS) (1cc/kg/h before percutaneous angiography and 24 hours after)&#xD;
      the incidence of CI-AKI within the following 3 days was 21% in the group without NS and 11%&#xD;
      in the NS+ group (p=0.016). Further, CI-AKI was associated with increased risk of death&#xD;
      (15.2% vs 2.8%; p&lt;0.0001) and need for renal replacement therapy (13.4% vs 0%; p&lt;0.0001). In&#xD;
      another trial involving 216 patients, pre- and post-procedure hydration reduced the incidence&#xD;
      of CI-AKI in the hydrated group versus the non-hydrated control group 20.4% versus 35.2%, p&lt;&#xD;
      0.05). These results were confirmed in the POSEIDON trial which also showed that a LVEDP&#xD;
      (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) guided hydration strategy for the prevention of&#xD;
      CI-AKI results in an even greater relative and absolute risk reduction in contrast&#xD;
      nephropathy in comparison to the standard hydration strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of CI-AKI is thought to involve renal artery vasoconstriction and the&#xD;
      development of reactive oxygen species which leads to direct renal oxidative stress and&#xD;
      ischemic injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) defines CI-AKI as an increase in serum&#xD;
      creatinine level ≥0.5 mg/dl or &gt;25% compared with the baseline value within a period of 48-72&#xD;
      hours after contrast media (CM) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning is not as simple. According to a&#xD;
      pathophysiologic concept, repeated short duration ischemia in an organ induces a&#xD;
      ''resistance'' to a later prolonged ischemia. That is, a brief period of ischemia induces&#xD;
      endogenous protective mechanisms that increase tissue tolerance to subsequent lethal&#xD;
      ischemia. This is a physiological adaptive mechanism of protection of tissues faced to&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, which has therapeutic potential when ischemia-reperfusion is induced in a&#xD;
      targeted way. In 1982, this mechanism called ischemic preconditioning (IPC) was highlighted&#xD;
      for the first time on canine models in myocardial infarction. In experiments, cycles of&#xD;
      alternating ischemia and reperfusion were applied to dogs by using a balloon to occlude a&#xD;
      coronary artery. This allowed the prevention of necrotic myocardial territories. These&#xD;
      results have opened prospects on a possible use of this method of preconditioning for&#xD;
      myocardial protection as well as preconditioning for renal protection in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our remote ischemic preconditioning protocol would comprise four (4) cycles of 5 min of&#xD;
      ischemia followed by 5 min of reperfusion for the experimental group. The BP cuff would be&#xD;
      placed around the upper non-dominant arm (e.g upper left arm in a right-handed patient) and&#xD;
      inflated to a pressure set at 50 mmHg higher than baseline systolic BP to induce transient&#xD;
      ischemia followed by subsequent deflation to ensure 5 minutes of reperfusion in the RIPC&#xD;
      group. The absence of distal pulse would be confirmed with Doppler evaluation or palpation of&#xD;
      the radial and ulnar artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, sham preconditioning would be performed by inflating an upper-arm blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff to diastolic pressure levels and then deflating the cuff to 10 mm Hg below&#xD;
      diastolic pressure for 5 minutes to maintain nonischemic upper-arm compression for blinding&#xD;
      purposes with regard to the patients; this will be followed by complete deflation of cuff for&#xD;
      5 minutes. Again a total of four cycles would be ensured. In individuals presenting with BMI&#xD;
      &gt; 30 kg/m2 , a dedicated blood pressure cuff for obese patients will be used. Time from RIPC&#xD;
      to the procedure (either CA or diagnostic contrast study) will be within &lt;120 min in all&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the control group or RIPC&#xD;
      group. Randomization will be performed by data analysis software, which would determine&#xD;
      whether the patient would fall under the RIPC arm vs Sham-procedure arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard care for patients with impaired renal function undergoing&#xD;
      CA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended hydration will consist of saline 0.9% solution infusion at a rate of 1 mL/Kg/h&#xD;
      for 12 hours prior to contrast medium injection and up to 12 hours thereafter, unless there&#xD;
      is evidence of fluid overload thus contraindicating further fluid administration. Metformin,&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, and&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be discontinued at least 24 hours before the&#xD;
      angiography. Blood samples for basic metabolic panel (BMP) would be drawn prior to coronary&#xD;
      intervention/diagnostic contrast study and repeated 48-72 hrs following contrast medium&#xD;
      administration. A final BMP would be checked at 6 weeks after contrast procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following IRB approval, studies will begin with a target of including 300 patients in the&#xD;
      study, with a tentative timeline of three (3) years. We will obtain BMPs on the day of the&#xD;
      procedure (to document baseline creatinine), and then repeat 48-72 hrs after CA/diagnostic&#xD;
      contrast studies. No additional visits would be required apart from a visit to the&#xD;
      phlebotomist for getting the BMP checked within 48-72 hrs and another visit for repeat BMP&#xD;
      check at 6 weeks. Almost all of our patients who undergo CA will have a follow-up appointment&#xD;
      with their PCP in the next 3-7 days, but no extra visits are required for the study purpose.&#xD;
      No extra costs on the part of the patient would be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our intervention group- remote ischemic preconditioning group- would be subject to four (4)&#xD;
      cycles of 5 min of ischemia followed by 5 min of reperfusion for the experimental group. The&#xD;
      BP cuff would be placed around the upper non-dominant arm (e.g upper left arm in a&#xD;
      right-handed patient) and inflated to a pressure set at 50 mmHg higher than baseline systolic&#xD;
      BP to induce transient ischemia followed by subsequent deflation to ensure 5 minutes of&#xD;
      reperfusion in the RIPC group. The absence of distal pulse would be confirmed with Doppler&#xD;
      evaluation or palpation of the radial and ulnar artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, sham preconditioning would be performed by inflating an upper-arm blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff to diastolic pressure levels and then deflating the cuff to 10 mm Hg below&#xD;
      diastolic pressure for 5 minutes to maintain nonischemic upper-arm compression for blinding&#xD;
      purposes with regard to the patients; this will be followed by complete deflation of cuff for&#xD;
      5 minutes. Again a total of four cycles would be ensured. In individuals presenting with BMI&#xD;
      &gt; 30 kg/m2 , a dedicated blood pressure cuff for obese patients will be used. Time from RIPC&#xD;
      to the procedure (either CA or diagnostic contrast study) will be within &lt;120 min in all&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to our above mentioned intervention (RIPC), all patients will receive standard of&#xD;
      care for patients with impaired renal function undergoing CA as mentioned below (No.1 and&#xD;
      No.2) :-&#xD;
&#xD;
      No.1: Recommended hydration will consist of saline 0.9% solution infusion at a rate of 1&#xD;
      mL/Kg/h for 12 hours prior to contrast medium injection and up to 12 hours thereafter, unless&#xD;
      there is evidence of fluid overload thus contraindicating further fluid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No.2: Metformin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers,&#xD;
      diuretics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be discontinued at least 24hours&#xD;
      before the angiography.&#xD;
