      The purpose of this study is to compare data from a battery of novel mobile health&#xD;
      technologies to standard-of-care validated patient questionnaires and clinician rating scales&#xD;
      in Parkinson's disease patients.&#xD;

      Mobile health technologies include the wearable sensor technologies that are body-worn and&#xD;
      passively collect information and mobile devices like smartphones that can be frequently used&#xD;
      by patients to actively or passively collect information. However, there has been limited&#xD;
      comparison of different wearable technologies to validated clinical rating scales to allow us&#xD;
      to come to a consensus about their utility in both clinical practice and research trials.&#xD;
      Data from mobile health technologies in Parkinson's Disease (PD) have not been validated to&#xD;
      use in the place of clinician rating scales. It is also not clear if the information obtained&#xD;
      with the devices consistently correlates with change on the clinician scales and longitudinal&#xD;
      motor decline. Technological challenges, such as the feasibility (safety, compliance) of use&#xD;
      devices in patients with neurodegenerative disease, change in equipment and algorithms over&#xD;
      time, collaboration with companies who may own patents, and other issues may also limit their&#xD;
      use in healthcare and research. The purpose of this study is to compare data from a battery&#xD;
      of novel mobile health technologies to standard-of-care validated patient questionnaires and&#xD;
      clinician rating scales in PD patients. The hypothesis is that there will be an association&#xD;
      between data from mobile health technologies and data obtained from validated&#xD;
      questionnaires/scales, indicating that these technologies are a reliable means of monitoring&#xD;
      motor symptomatology and functional impairment and disability over time. The primary aims of&#xD;
      the study are to compare information on continuously-measured patient-reported PD-related&#xD;
      functional impairment and disability changes from traditional validated questionnaires to&#xD;
      continuously-measured health-related data from a battery of novel mobile health technologies,&#xD;
      and to assess the feasibility (compliance, safety, satisfaction) of PD patients to use a&#xD;
      battery of novel mobile health technologies.&#xD;

Part III assesses motor disabilities of a subject at the time of the visit and Part IV assesses motor complications in the week prior to the visit. A total of 46 items are included in Parts I, II and III. Each item will receive a score ranging from 0 to 4 where 0 represents the absence of impairment and 4 represents the highest degree of impairment.</description>

    <description>To examine the relationship between in-home continuous measures of tremor, bradykinesia, mobility, and dyskinesia acquired over a 7-day period, from 2 mobile health technologies (Personal Kinetigraph, Kinesia 360) with one-time in-clinic measures of motor functional ability pertaining to the same 7-day period as assessed by Part 2 of the MDS-UPDRS, Part 4 of the MDS-UPDRS, Neuro-QOL, and PDQ-39. This will be examined in n=20 patients (10 patients assigned to each technology with a crossover at 3 months for a total of 20 patients over 6 months, 6 timepoints with data collected every 2 weeks). Patients will then be following for an observational period of an additional 6 months.</description>
