  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent tachycardia in sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is an ominous&#xD;
      sign. This usually comes under control with judicious use of antibiotics, fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation, sedation. Uncontrolled tachycardia in systemic inflammatory response syndrome&#xD;
      and sepsis deprives the heart muscle of oxygen. As it progresses, insufficient heart muscle&#xD;
      nutrition eventually leads to myocardial dysfunction. It can also present as heart failure.&#xD;
      In acute coronary syndromes, beta blockers are used to control heart rate. However in MODS,&#xD;
      it cannot be used due to hemodynamic instability and worsened myocardial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinoatrial (SA) myocytes are the pacemaker cells in the heart. Pacemaker activity involves&#xD;
      several ionic currents that influences spontaneous depolarization of SA node including I(f)&#xD;
      current. The word I(f) means funny, because this current has unusual properties as compared&#xD;
      with other currents known at the time of its discovery. It is one of the most important ionic&#xD;
      current for regulating pacemaker activity in SA node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivabradine is an I(f) current inhibitor in SA node. Currently, it is the only agent shown to&#xD;
      clinically lower heart rate with no negative inotropism or effects on conduction and&#xD;
      contractility.so usage of Ivabradine to control tachycardia in patients with septic shock may&#xD;
      help to improve myocardial filling and cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Marcos L.Miranda et al. found that Ivabradine was effective in reducing microvascular&#xD;
      derangements evoked by experimental sepsis, which was accompanied by less organ dysfunction.&#xD;
      These results suggest that ivabradine yields beneficial effects on the microcirculation of&#xD;
      septic animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data found on effect of Ivabradine on the microcirculation of human. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate the effect of Ivabradine on perfusion in capillary circulation&#xD;
      using Cytocam video microscope, Braedius®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be monitored with non-invasive arterial blood pressure, five-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, and invasive arterial pressure (AP) obtained from&#xD;
      a radial arterial catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon ICU admission, according to the investigators' institutional protocol, fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness will be done for all enrolled patients to determine the need for fluid therapy&#xD;
      (fluid responsiveness is defined as an increase in the stroke volume (SV) by 15% after&#xD;
      infusing 500 ml crystalloids). Fluid boluses will be repeated till the patients become fluid&#xD;
      unresponsiveness. If mean arterial pressure (MAP) remained &lt; 65 mm Hg after administration of&#xD;
      the initial fluid bolus, norepinephrine infusion will be titrated to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After establishment of blood pressure and normovolemia, the patient will receive either&#xD;
      placebo or Ivabradine according to the group randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of microcirculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sublingual microcirculatory measurements will be performed with an incident dark-field&#xD;
      illumination device Cytocam- incident dark-field illumination (IDF), Braedius Medical,&#xD;
      Huizen, Netherlands). The new technology Cytocam-IDF imaging device consists of a pen-like&#xD;
      probe incorporating IDF illumination with a set of high-resolution lenses projecting images&#xD;
      on to a computer-controlled image sensor synchronized with a short-pulsed illumination light.&#xD;
      Flow characteristics of the microvasculature will be quantified using the microvascular ﬂow&#xD;
      index (MFI), a semiquantitative technique consistent with recommendations from a consensus&#xD;
      conference on microcirculatory image analysis in human subjects.The image is divided into&#xD;
      four quadrants and the vessels &lt;20 μ m diameter are assigned a score based on the predominant&#xD;
      flow characteristics of the vessels in that quadrant (0 = absent flow; 1 = intermittent; 2 =&#xD;
      sluggish; 3 = normal). The values in each quadrant will be averaged to give an MFI for each&#xD;
      sublingual site at each time point. To determine heterogeneity of perfusion, the flow&#xD;
      heterogeneity index will be calculated as the highest MFI minus the lowest MFI divided by the&#xD;
      mean MFI. A quantitative measurement of the total vessel density (TVD), perfused vessel&#xD;
      density (PVD), and proportion of perfused vessels (PPV), will also be taken automatically&#xD;
      with dedicated software (Cytocam video microscope, Braedius®, Netherlands). The observer will&#xD;
      be well-trained and experienced with offline analysis. On all videos, post-process contrast&#xD;
      enhancement will be applied. Thereafter videos will be blinded and anonymized so that the&#xD;
      observer will not be aware of the used drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of cardiac output using LiDCOrapid Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 20-G arterial catheter will be placed in the radial artery and connected to the standard&#xD;
      monitor. LiDCOrapid (LiDCO Ltd, Cambridge, UK) will be connected to the monitor and data will&#xD;
      be extracted from the AP line. Values for AP and heart rate extracted by LiDCOrapid will be&#xD;
      in all patients within 5% of the standard monitor's displayed values (datex monitor). The&#xD;
      LiDCO system is based on a PulseCO algorithm for calculating nominal cardiac output (CO), SV&#xD;
      and heart rate from AP waveform characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of metabolic parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic parameters including central venous saturation (ScvO2), central venous-arterial&#xD;
      blood carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Pv-aCO2), and arterial lactate will be&#xD;
      recorded. Simultaneous blood gas measurements will be obtained from arterial and central&#xD;
      venous catheters. Blood gas analysis will be performed and arterial lactate concentration&#xD;
      will be determined using the GEM Premier 3000 (Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA, USA).&#xD;
      ScvO2 will be calculated from a sample taken from the central venous catheter, the tip of&#xD;
      which will be confirmed to be in the superior vena cava near or at the right atrium by&#xD;
      radiography. The (Pv-aCO2) will be calculated as the difference between the partial pressures&#xD;
      of central venous carbon dioxide (PcvCO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2).&#xD;
