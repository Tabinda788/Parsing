  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minority children disproportionately experience racial bias, which is linked to school&#xD;
      failure, toxic stress, and health disparities. In contrast, a type of racial socialization&#xD;
      called cultural pride reinforcement has been associated with positive academic, behavioral,&#xD;
      and mental health outcomes. A clinic-based intervention to boost cultural pride may help&#xD;
      parents foster resilience in their young children against the negative effects of racial&#xD;
      bias. The investigators evaluated the extent to which a standard clinic-based early literacy&#xD;
      program (Reach Out and Read (ROR)) and a similar program enhanced with cultural pride content&#xD;
      (Cultural Pride Reinforcement for Early School Readiness (CPR4ESR)) are associated with&#xD;
      improved cultural pride reinforcement practices, child development, family-provider&#xD;
      communication, and health care utilization. Given the high representation of young children&#xD;
      of color in the sample, the investigators hypothesized better outcomes among those who&#xD;
      received the culturally tailored CPR4ESR program compared to those who received the standard&#xD;
      ROR program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate parental delivery of cultural pride messages, child development, and&#xD;
      health services outcomes, 106 parents of children ages 6 months to 5 years old were recruited&#xD;
      from two child-serving health institutions in Southern California. This study utilized both&#xD;
      an intervention group (n=67) and a control group (n=39). Recruitment and baseline&#xD;
      intervention for this study took place on the same day, with one 3-month follow-up conducted&#xD;
      over the telephone, and a 1-year post-enrollment review of the child's medical chart. Only a&#xD;
      subset (n=14) participated in the medical chart review. Details of the study methodology are&#xD;
      provided below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Parents were recruited from two child-serving community health clinics in&#xD;
      Southern California. Participants were at least 18 years of age, had a child who was between&#xD;
      6 months and 5 years of age, was of African American, Asian, Latino race/ethnicity or diverse&#xD;
      cultural perspective, and reported a primary language that was English or Spanish. Potential&#xD;
      participants were identified by the health clinics' coordinating research staff and the&#xD;
      clinical pediatrics team. Research assistants (RAs) from the study conferred with the medical&#xD;
      staff for each pediatric team to review participant eligibility. The pediatric team&#xD;
      distributed the study flyer to those parents who met study eligibility at their scheduled&#xD;
      well-child or sick-child visit. Additionally, study flyers were posted at the clinic.&#xD;
      Recruitment script and informed consent took approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Treatment Assignment Participants comprising the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group were determined by designating all participating parents with office visits on&#xD;
      even days of the month to the intervention group and all participating parents with office&#xD;
      visits on odd days of the month to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group The intervention entails distribution of a children's book with a cultural&#xD;
      pride theme, the cultural pride parent book-sharing guide, and the study survey. Consented&#xD;
      intervention participants selected and received a developmentally appropriate (baby, toddler,&#xD;
      or preschool) book from the RA that featured African American, Latino, Asian, or diverse&#xD;
      cultural pride perspectives. All books selected for distribution in the intervention group&#xD;
      were vetted through a community advisory board. The cultural pride books differ from the&#xD;
      standard ROR books distributed at office visits in that the ROR books address age-related&#xD;
      developmental and interactive content, but do not focus on or require specific images and&#xD;
      narratives reflective of racial, ethnic, or cultural perspectives in their content.&#xD;
      Participating parents were asked to complete the study survey. The survey collected&#xD;
      information on demographics, racial socialization (including cultural pride reinforcement),&#xD;
      child development, and family-provider communication. Portions of the survey used a 5-point&#xD;
      Likert scale to rate the extent to which parents agreed or disagreed with each item. The&#xD;
      survey was administered via paper and pencil during the initial intervention in the&#xD;
      clinic-designated research room. The RA remained in the room with the participants to address&#xD;
      any questions participants may have had when completing the survey. The survey was translated&#xD;
      into Spanish. The intervention took approximately 30 minutes: 10 minutes for&#xD;
      recruitment/study information and consent, and 20 minutes for book material distribution and&#xD;
      review, and survey. Confidentiality of data collected for the survey was maintained through&#xD;
      the use of codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group The control condition involves distribution of standard ROR book and&#xD;
      book-sharing advice, and the study survey. Consented participants received the standard ROR&#xD;
      reading advice and a ROR book. Some books from the standard ROR book list may include images&#xD;
      reflective of study participants, but without a direct cultural pride message; therefore,&#xD;
      books selected from the ROR children's book list for this study were reviewed and selected by&#xD;
      the study PI in order to exclude any ROR books for distribution that may resemble cultural&#xD;
      pride books. The comparison group was asked to complete the same study survey as the&#xD;
      intervention group using the protocol described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three Month Follow-Up Survey Three months following the initial intervention date at clinics&#xD;
      with the intervention and control group participants, RAs conducted follow-up telephone calls&#xD;
      to participants. Participants were asked, via phone, to complete the same survey as before&#xD;
      with 1 additional question to assess feedback on the study experience. For the follow-up&#xD;
      survey, participants were read the questions over the phone (in English or Spanish) and their&#xD;
      responses documented on a paper survey by RAs. Confidentiality of data collected for the&#xD;
      survey was maintained through the use of codes. The follow-up survey took approximately 10&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-Year Chart Review In the year following enrollment, clinic personnel reviewed the medical&#xD;
      charts of the children whose parents participated in the study and agreed to the optional&#xD;
      chart review. Chart reviews identified subsequent records for: number and type of well-child&#xD;
      and sick-child visits, dates of office visits, vaccines status at the 1-year mark, and if&#xD;
      documented, follow-up visits and diagnosis from emergency room care. During the initial&#xD;
      recruitment and intervention at the office visit those participating consented parents were&#xD;
      asked if they gave their permission for the clinic to access their child's medical charts for&#xD;
      use in the study. Parents were provided with HIPAA information sheets and an authorization&#xD;
      form for release of their child's protected health information.&#xD;
