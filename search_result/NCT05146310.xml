    <textblock>
      I.SPACE® is a hyaluronic acid injectable gel CE (European Conformity) marketed since 2010. It&#xD;
      is indicated for use as a surgical aid in ophthalmic anterior segment surgery. The aim is to&#xD;
      protect the corneal endothelium and maintains the intraocular space.The product should be&#xD;
      instilled in the anterior chamber of the eye and adjusted according to the volume of the&#xD;
      aqueous humour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 80 patients aged from 18 to 84 years' old at inclusion, who have at least one&#xD;
      eye with cataract (mild to moderate severity) based on subjective ophthalmic examination by&#xD;
      the investigator, who have given his/her informed consent and meet all the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come to a total of 7 visits over a period of 3 months. Protection of corneal&#xD;
      endothelium (Mean percent change of CEC density) after baseline injection will be assessed.&#xD;
      Surgeon's satisfaction during cataract surgery, mean change in Intraocular Pressure (IOP),&#xD;
      percentage of eyes with IOP spikes ≥ 30mm mmHg, corneal thickness, intraocular inflammation,&#xD;
      Mean Snellen monocular Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuities (UCDVA), Best Corrected Distance&#xD;
      Visual Acuities (BCDVA) and safety will be also assessed.&#xD;

      PROMIR is a prospective, multicenter, non-comparative post-marketing study of a class IIb&#xD;
      medical device (medical device regulatory classification IIb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This uncontrolled open-label study investigates the efficacy and safety of I.SPACE® in&#xD;
      corneal endothelium protection and intraocular space maintain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration is 3 months with a screening visit (V0) up to 14 days before injection,&#xD;
      the baseline visit (injection of I.SPACE®), V1) and 5 follow-up visits after 6 hours, 24&#xD;
      hours, 7 days, 30 days and 90 days (V1' to V5). It is envisaged to enroll 80 patients with&#xD;
      planned cataract surgery for at least 1 eye in France to obtain at least 68 evaluable&#xD;
      patients, which will be monitored over 3 months after baseline injection of I.SPACE® .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is defined as the mean percent change of CEC density at 3 months (90&#xD;
      days) post-operation (V5) from Baseline (V0). The effectiveness of I.SPACE® will be&#xD;
      demonstrated if the CEC density loss is statistically non-superior to a pre-specified&#xD;
      threshold of 10% (non-inferiority to -10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeon's satisfaction after cataract surgery (questionnaire) will be evaluated at V1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection of corneal endothelium (Mean percent change of CEC density) will be also assessed&#xD;
      at V4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean change in Intraocular Pressure (IOP), percentage of eyes with IOP spikes ≥ 30mm mmHg,&#xD;
      intraocular inflammation and safety will be assessed at all timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal thickness will be assessed at V2,V3 and V5. Mean Snellen monocular Uncorrected&#xD;
      Distance Visual Acuities (UCDVA), Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuities (BCDVA) and ocular&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed at V2, V3, V4 and V5.&#xD;
