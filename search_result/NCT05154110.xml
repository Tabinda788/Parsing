  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flexibility is a measurable physical capacity considered a key component of physical fitness.&#xD;
      Poor flexibility is usually attributed to excessive tension exerted by the antagonist muscles&#xD;
      of the movement and supported by weak scientific evidence, static stretching is considered as&#xD;
      the most effective intervention in the promotion of muscle extensibility, in attempting to&#xD;
      improve mobility.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Flexibility is a measurable physical capacity considered as a key component of physical&#xD;
      fitness thereby contributing to the health and performance of joints and the musculoskeletal&#xD;
      system. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that muscle weakness is a major&#xD;
      factor behind reduced mobility. Consequently, training muscle contractility is likely to&#xD;
      improve mobility . Regardless of terminology and of the quality of supporting evidence,&#xD;
      stretching emerges as an intervention that elongates the tissues in attempting to improve&#xD;
      mobility . Shortening lengthens the tissue on two out of three axes, while stretching only&#xD;
      lengthens the tissue on one axis out of three . All training, including movement, is, by&#xD;
      definition, training of shortening and stretching cycles (SSCs). Ergo, resistance training is&#xD;
      also, inherently, one way to elongate . Strength training is an active, voluntary, dynamic&#xD;
      form of stretching. Indeed, strength training is dynamic stretching. Often, strength training&#xD;
      is performed against external resistances, but this is not mandatory. Moreover, strength&#xD;
      training has been shown to improve mobility in sedentary adults , .&#xD;

    <description>SSubjects will be refrained from maximum-effort or new routines for exercise the day before each treatment.Static stretching of hamstring on whole body vibration will include Pre- and post-test active and passive ROM for the both legs, with subjects first undergoing a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle. The traditional static stretch consisted of a supine active knee extension on whole body vibration (WBV) at 30 Hz at the &quot;high&quot; amplitude setting will be performed. The stretch will be held at the point of the onset of discomfort 3 times each for 30 seconds, with a 20-second rest period between each stretch. Participants will stretch for 4 days per week for 4 weeks. Active hamstring ROM will be measured via active knee extension using a goniometer with the leg in 90째 of hip flexion, with the opposite leg extended. Passive ROM will be measured via clinician-assist ted knee extension with the leg in 90째 of hip flexion.</description>

    <description>In second group, strength training will be done for 4 days per week for 4 days. Subjects will have 5 minutes warm up. In 1st week, the protocol will be Nordic hamstring curl (NHC) with bend (3 sets of 8 reps), Prone hamstrings curl (4 sets of 12 reps/leg), Physio-ball leg curl (3 sets of 8 reps), Glute bridge (2 sets of 50 s/leg). In 2nd to 4th week, the protocol will be NHC with bend (3 sets of 12 reps) Prone hamstrings curl (3 sets of 14 reps/leg) Physio-ball leg curl (3 sets of 10 reps) Glute bridge (2 sets of 50 s/leg). There will be 30 seconds rest between each set and 1 minute rest between each exercise . Pre and post AROM and PROM will be measured. Active hamstring ROM will be measured via active knee extension using a goniometer with the leg in 90째 of hip flexion, with the opposite leg extended. Passive ROM will be measured via clinician-assisted knee extension with the leg in 90째 of hip flexion.</description>
