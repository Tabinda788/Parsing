  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Investigator-Initiated, phase 2, prospective, open-label study designed to be&#xD;
      conducted in six hospitals in Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will initially receive an induction phase of six 28-day cycles of&#xD;
      isatuximab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCd),&#xD;
      followed by a maintenance phase with isatuximab and lenalidomide until disease progression,&#xD;
      death, unacceptable adverse events, lost to follow up, or consent withdrawal, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. The study will last for approximately 36 months (follow-up period), starting&#xD;
      from the date of the first patient in, to the date of the last patient last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of induction treatment with isatuximab in&#xD;
      combination with VCd on the renal function of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      and severe renal impairment (RI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of isatuximab in combination with VCd,&#xD;
      followed by lenalidomide maintenance on: Overall response rate, Progression-Free Survival,&#xD;
      Time to Response, Duration of Response, Overall Survival, Minimal Residual Disease negativity&#xD;
      rate, Safety&#xD;

             drug administration. Note: patients with planned surgical procedures to be conducted&#xD;
             under local anesthesia may participate. Kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty are not&#xD;
             considered major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the study&#xD;
             drugs, monoclonal antibodies, human proteins, or their excipients (refer to isatuximab&#xD;

             following the last dose of isatuximab or three months following the last dose of the&#xD;
             rest of the study treatment, whichever is longer. This includes one highly effective&#xD;
             form of contraception (tubal ligation, intrauterine device, hormonal [birth control&#xD;
             pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings or implants] or partner's&#xD;
             vasectomy) and one additional effective contraceptive method (male latex or synthetic&#xD;
             condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap).&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. FCBP who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy: a) twice before study&#xD;
             treatment initiation (one 10-14 days prior to start of study drug and one within 24&#xD;
             hours prior to start of study drug. Urine tests must have a sensitivity of ≥25&#xD;
             mIU/mL), b) weekly during 1st month of treatment and then prior to each treatment&#xD;
             cycle administration or c) every two weeks in case of irregular menstrual cycles, and&#xD;
             d) up to five months following the last dose of isatuximab or three months following&#xD;

         14. Male participants who refuse to practice abstinence or use a condom during sexual&#xD;
             contact with a pregnant female or an FCBP while participating in the study, during&#xD;
             dose interruptions and at least five months following the last dose of isatuximab or&#xD;
             three months following the last dose of the rest of the study treatment, whichever is&#xD;
             longer, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 1: an FCBP is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some time point, 2) has not&#xD;
        undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally&#xD;
        postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing&#xD;
        potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the&#xD;
        preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 2: True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
        lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
        post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
