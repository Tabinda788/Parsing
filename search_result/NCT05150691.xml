  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation and dose-expansion Phase 1/2a trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of DB-1303 in subjects with advanced solid tumors that express HER2.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, FIH study. The study&#xD;
      consists of two parts: Part 1 adopts an accelerated titration at first dose level followed&#xD;
      with classic &quot;3+3&quot; design to identify the MTD/RP2D; Part 2 is a dose expansion phase to&#xD;
      confirm the safety, tolerability and explore efficacy in selected malignant solid tumors at&#xD;
      the MTD/the RP2D. This study will enroll subjects with advanced/unresectable, recurrent, or&#xD;
      metastatic HER2-expressing malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
