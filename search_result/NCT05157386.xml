  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Braining&quot; is a clinical method for physical exercise as adjunctive therapy in psychiatric&#xD;
      care. The core components are personnel-led group training sessions and motivating contact&#xD;
      with psychiatric staff, as well as measurement and evaluation before and after the training&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. This study aims to describe the clinical and demographic variables in the&#xD;
      population of patients who participated in Braining 2017-2020, investigate the feasibility of&#xD;
      Braining, and analyse perceived short-term effects and side effects of Braining regarding&#xD;
      psychiatric and somatic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. The project is a retrospective, descriptive study. Patients at Psykiatri Sydväst&#xD;
      (PSV, Psychiatric Clinic Psychiatry Southwest, Stockholm) who participated in Braining&#xD;
      2017-2020 during at least 3 training sessions, will be asked for inclusion. Medical and&#xD;
      demographic data, as well as patient treatment evaluations, are already available in medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The method &quot;Braining&quot; is a clinical invention that helps patients to initiate and execute&#xD;
      physical exercise (PE) regularly in psychiatric care. The core components are basic high&#xD;
      performance group training sessions and motivational work led by the psychiatric staff.&#xD;
      Braining is used as add-on treatment to regular psychiatric care (treatment as usual; TAU)&#xD;
      and is included in the patient care plan. Braining is unique in that it:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Includes trained psychiatric clinical staff leading group exercise sessions together&#xD;
           with patients from both out- and inpatient ward units in daily, high endurance group&#xD;
           training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is included in regular healthcare fee (free of charge).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Includes a motivational and educational visit (as either a group seminar or as an&#xD;
           individual visit) at the start and end of a training period; usually 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Includes regular measurements (self-assessment questionnaires, blood samples, physical&#xD;
           and mental health examination and education before and after the twelve week training&#xD;
           period).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Includes short individual motivating visits before every training session, including&#xD;
           assessment of day shape and fitness to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific purpose of the project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe clinical and demographic variables in patients participating in Braining&#xD;
           2017-2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the feasibility of the Braining method (PE together with staff as adjunctive&#xD;
           therapy in Psychiatric care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyse perceived short-term effects and side effects of Braining regarding psychiatric&#xD;
           and somatic symptoms (degree of psychiatric symptoms, changes in molecular and&#xD;
           cardiovascular parameters, lifestyle patterns, level of functioning and perceived&#xD;
           quality of life). Also, if possible, provide an estimate of what long-term effects that&#xD;
           might be expected in coming long-term clinical follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients at PSV who participated in Braining 2017-2020 during at least 3 training&#xD;
      sessions and do not meet the exclusion criteria will be asked for inclusion. For this&#xD;
      population the investigators plan to describe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and medical variables (such as diagnosis, age, gender, functional level,&#xD;
           staff-assessed severity of psychiatric disease, self-assessment scales for symptoms of&#xD;
           depression, mania / hypomania, and anxiety, self-assessed health-related quality of&#xD;
           life, degree of sick leave, ongoing pharmacological treatment, ongoing CBT (cognitive&#xD;
           behavioral therapy), need for emergency visits, inpatient care, suicidal attempts).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of the Braining method. Evaluation of the degree of participation in&#xD;
           Braining (such as number of training sessions performed, participation over time,&#xD;
           differences between subgroups, possible incidents) as well as the participants'&#xD;
           experience of Braining (based on surveys and follow-up interviews: positive or negative&#xD;
           subjective assessments of the method, to what extent is the method recommended to other&#xD;
           patients). Adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences before and after Braining in terms of statistically significant change in&#xD;
           [I] degree of psychiatric symptoms and function, [II] cardio metabolic factors such as&#xD;
           blood pressure, BMI, waist measurement, weight, [III] molecular parameters such as serum&#xD;
           concentration of blood lipids, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, CRP, [IV] health-related&#xD;
           quality of life, [V] level of social function (such as work/study/sick leave) and care&#xD;
           needs (such as need of inpatient care, medicine, emergency visits), [VI] assessed&#xD;
           severity of psychiatric disorder, [VII] lifestyle patterns such as exercise, sleep,&#xD;
           diet, substance use.&#xD;

    <description>Core components of Braining: Personnel-led training sessions, motivating contact with psychiatric staff, measurement and evaluation before and after the training period; usually 12 weeks. PE is added on to treatment as usual (TAU). The training sessions are moderate to intense aerobic group training, 30-45 minutes. Each training session is preceded by a short (5-10 minutes) individual meeting with staff including assessment of daily form, motivational work, and the opportunity to ask questions. The target frequency for participation is preferably at least three training sessions/week during a 12 week period. The training period for each patient begins with an informative and motivating group or individual lecture or and an individual introductory meeting with staff including psychiatric and somatic examination, self-assessment scales for symptoms and quality of life, and blood samples. The training period ends with a meeting with staff with follow-up on the parameters.</description>
