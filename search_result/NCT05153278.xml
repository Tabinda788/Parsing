  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will retrospectively collect data of patients infused at UMC's emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      with long acting irons (ferric carboxymaltose, iron dextran, iron sucrose, etc.), in&#xD;
      addition, patients infused with blood products, with intent to treat iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      (IDA). Patient records reviewed will be from patients who were infused at UMC ED from January&#xD;
      2013 to June 2018. Primary aim of analysis will be to investigate superiority between&#xD;
      interventions implemented for treating IDA. In addition, we will utilize data to characterize&#xD;
      patients who used ED services as an avenue to receive treatment for IDA. Further, we will&#xD;
      conduct cost analysis between different IDA directed treatments administered in the ED at&#xD;
      UMC.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a condition that impacts approximately 2-billion people&#xD;
      globally, and impacts individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds, making it one of the&#xD;
      most common nutritional disorders in the world [1]. In any population, women and children are&#xD;
      the groups that are more susceptible to suffering from IDA [3]. IDA has broad influences on&#xD;
      the health of an individual, ranging from cognitive decline to motor deficits [4]. When&#xD;
      coupled with pregnancy, IDA has been shown to be associated with low birth weight and carries&#xD;
      an increased risk of maternal and perinatal mortality [5]. In addition to women and children,&#xD;
      the prevalence of IDA has been found to increase with age, and with chronic disease [6]. The&#xD;
      approach to treating IDA regularly begins with oral iron supplementation. However, due to&#xD;
      increased gastrointestinal side effects or excessive losses of iron, intravenous iron has&#xD;
      been shown to be better tolerated [7,8]. Further, intravenous iron is another attractable&#xD;
      iron replacement strategy in IDA when the need for rapid delivery is required, such as in&#xD;
      pregnancy or following traumas. When compared to blood products, intravenous iron is another&#xD;
      attractable option due to its ready availability [9,10]. We are experiencing unprecedented&#xD;
      rates of hospitals providing care for older patients and patients with chronic diseases [11].&#xD;
      With a growing and aging population, in addition patients living longer with chronic disease,&#xD;
      it is important that major health problems such as IDA be investigated further in order to&#xD;
      identify sustainable therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study will provide us with valuable knowledge on which treatment for IDA&#xD;
      may be most effective in treating our El Paso population of patients suffering from IDA&#xD;
      (Primary Aim). This study will also allow us to identify which IDA treatment is most cost&#xD;
      effective (Secondary Aim A), and which population of the community would benefit the most&#xD;
      from an outpatient infusion service (Secondary Aim B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chart Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receiving one IDA intervention in the UMC ED who had at least one complete blood&#xD;
      count or hemoglobin after discharge from the emergency department or hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no records of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Patient Records and Data: Patient records reviewed will be from patients who&#xD;
      were infused at UMC ED from January 2013 to June 2018. The age group of patients will be&#xD;
      those greater than 18 years of age. We will include all patients presenting to or treated at&#xD;
      UMC ED during this five and one-half year period. Patient information such as unique&#xD;
      identifiers (e.g. medical record number, hospital account number) will be used to navigate&#xD;
      patient records for approved research personnel only. No procedures will be performed as part&#xD;
      of this study. All data will be collected as a retrospective chart review. We will access&#xD;
      patient data through both UMC and Texas Tech electronic medical records as patients who&#xD;
      received an intervention may have received follow up in a Texas Tech clinic rather than the&#xD;
      UMC emergency department. The only risk of this study is the potential for loss of&#xD;
      confidentiality. Research personnel will take extra measures to reduce this risk. The&#xD;
      researchers will not publish any data that can be used to identify the patient, such as but&#xD;
      not limited to personal or unique identifiers, medical record numbers, hospital account&#xD;
      numbers or date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient charts will be identified through digital records of UMC pharmacy and UMC blood bank.&#xD;
      Patients included, will be those listed to have IDA by set criteria [Listed below], and who&#xD;
      were treated with at least one IDA intervention other than blood product transfusion. Control&#xD;
      group will be formed using patients who received at least one IDA intervention using blood&#xD;
      product transfusion only. We will attempt to match charts by age, condition leading to IDA,&#xD;
      and gender in final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Set criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient charts will be identified if they were the recipient of listed blood and bloodless&#xD;
      transfusion products for treatment of IDA.&#xD;
