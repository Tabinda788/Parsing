  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project focuses on perioperative bleeding that requires transfusion of blood products and&#xD;
      supplementation of intravascular volume with crystalloids and colloids. The implemented fluid&#xD;
      therapy affects coagulation and fibrinolysis, depending on the type of fluid used in an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion. Massive haemorrhage significantly impacts the perioperative period and&#xD;
      postoperative quality of life and requires individualized therapy, rending the ongoing&#xD;
      project relevant from the perspective of the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative bleeding is a complication that significantly affects postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      and quality of life and increases the patient's risk of death. Massive hemorrhage requires&#xD;
      individualized therapy, preferably based on international recommendations. It is necessary to&#xD;
      transfuse blood and blood products (red blood cells, freshly frozen plasma, platelets,&#xD;
      concentrates of coagulation factors) with simultaneous rational supplementation of the&#xD;
      intravascular space using crystalloids and colloids. Usually, these are large volumes that&#xD;
      are infused over a short time. Proceedings in the operating room and the intensive care unit&#xD;
      environment should stabilize the patient's general condition with the lowest possible risk of&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it has been shown that transfusions are not free from side effects. Transfusions may&#xD;
      result not only from &quot;classic&quot; post-transfusion complications (allergic reactions, haemolytic&#xD;
      reactions, infections, electrolyte disturbances) but also from iatrogenically generated&#xD;
      disorders in the circulatory system (fluid overload), respiratory ( acute lung injury), and&#xD;
      hemostasis (risk of hypercoagulability). It is also known that uncontrolled and unbalanced&#xD;
      fluid therapy per se may additionally affect the haemodynamic state, haemostasis, and the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thromboelastometry (thromboelastography) is becoming the standard of perioperative&#xD;
      haemostasis monitoring. It has been documented that it provides more reliable data than&#xD;
      standard laboratory tests, such as fibrinogen concentration, activated clotting time (ACT),&#xD;
      kaolin-kephalin (aPTT), prothrombin (PT), or INR index. The test can be performed as the&#xD;
      so-called point-of-care test (POC), which reduces the waiting time for the result and&#xD;
      facilitates goal-directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the effects of fluid infusion on physiological haemostasis in healthy&#xD;
      subjects who do not have a prior bleeding disorder and who are infused with fluids similarly&#xD;
      to resuscitation in massive bleeding. Only singular studies in international literature&#xD;
      attempted to answer this vital question. Still, the regular progress in the field of fluid&#xD;
      therapy makes the obtained data less and less valuable in clinical practice.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Standard laboratory coagulation tests and rotational thromboelastometry measurements</intervention_name>
    <description>Blood for coagulation tests (thromboelastometry, aPTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen concentration, D dimers) and blood morphology was collected just before and immediately after the fluid infusion. With the use of a vacuum system, 20 ml of blood was collected through an IV cannula. The first 5 ml of blood were disposed of due to the possible interference with vascular stasis and fluid infusion on the measurements results.&#xD;
Functional tests of coagulation were analysed through ROTEM. ROTEM coagulation analysis was carried out using a ROTEM delta analyzer (Tem Innovations GmbH, Munich, Germany), and assays were allowed to run for 60 minutes. Assays were run immediately after blood sampling to minimize a preanalytical error. Three ROTEM assays were run simultaneously, INTEM, EXTEM, and FIBTEM.</description>
