      This study is undertaken to explore the effects of a bovine colostrum containing MVM&#xD;
      (RiteStart) on different health aspects by quantitatively assessing relevant serum and saliva&#xD;
      biomarkers, over a 12-week period in participants.&#xD;

      Blood samples were drawn by a certified phlebotomist, prepared, and then analyzed by a&#xD;
      Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified independent laboratory. The&#xD;
      following components were measured in sera from the participants: Alanine Aminotransferase&#xD;
      (ALT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT), Red Blood Cell&#xD;
      Count (RBC), Hematocrit (HCT), Mean Cell Volume (MCV), Mean Cell Hemoglobin (MCH), Mean Cell&#xD;

      High-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), Low-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL),&#xD;
      Triglycerides, White Blood Cell Count (WBC), High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP).&#xD;
      Secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA) was measured in saliva collected from participants.&#xD;

    <description>RiteStart is a comprehensive multivitamin, multimineral, all-in-one daily supplement. Besides having comprehensive and balanced amounts of essential vitamins and minerals that the human body needs, RS includes many other health-promoting ingredients. For example, RS contains potent antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and E, oligomeric proanthocyanidins from pinebark and grapeseed extracts, lutein, CoQ10, alpha-lipoic acid, and green tea. It is also a source of essential fatty acids from fish and plant oils. RS contains transfer factor (bovine colostrum and egg yolk extracts) that support immunity [6, 7, 8]. RS also includes a blend of maitake mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, cordyceps, inositol hexaphosphate, olive leaf extract, and other ingredients that aim to further support immune function and overall health.</description>
