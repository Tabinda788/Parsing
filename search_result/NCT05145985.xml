  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging of society is a natural process, but it entails challenges in social, economic and&#xD;
      health aspects. It is important for mature people to maintain, for as long as possible,&#xD;
      adequate functional capacity to live independently and autonomously. Presentation of&#xD;
      reference values of functional abilities in continuous perspective (and not in 5-year periods&#xD;
      as it is in standards for SFT) is a better approach. This approach reflects the process of&#xD;
      change that occurs in functional ability. The aim of the study was to develop centile&#xD;
      distributions of fitness tests constituting the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) for women over 60&#xD;
      years of age in Poland, moving independently.&#xD;

      The aging of society is a natural process, but it entails challenges in social, economic and&#xD;
      health aspects. It is important for mature people to maintain, for as long as possible, an&#xD;
      adequate functional capacity to live independently and autonomously. In order to determine&#xD;
      the level of functional fitness, fitness tests are used. Such tests include the Senior&#xD;
      Fitness Test (another name: Fullerton Functional Fitness Test)- tests described below; One&#xD;
      Leg Standing Test - test that assesses static balance to diagnose symptoms of mobility&#xD;
      disability; Stops Walking When Talking - assesses risk of falling and ability to perform two&#xD;
      activities simultaneously (talking and walking), Berg Balance Scale - assesses ability to&#xD;
      maintain balance while performing specific tasks, does not assess gait; Four Square Step Test&#xD;
      (FSST) - assesses dynamic balance and coordination; Functional Reach Test (FRT) - oceans of&#xD;
      dynamic balance; Tinetti Test - oceans of balance during simple tasks and oceans of gait;&#xD;
      Short Physical Performance Battery - oceans of balance functioning and lower limb performance&#xD;
      in people over 60. age. On the basis of these fitness tests the level of a selected aspect of&#xD;
      functional ability is assessed, converting the results into points. Among the indicated tools&#xD;
      the Senior Fitness Test seems to be the most universal, as it is a comprehensive and useful&#xD;
      tool for multidimensional assessment of physical fitness of people over 60. It allows&#xD;
      observation of the gradual decline in functional ability with age. Additionally, the simple&#xD;
      tests and norms for the fitness tests in the Senior Fitness Test are defined for people aged&#xD;
      60-94. Publicly available norms were developed for the American population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of reference values for the fitness tests that make up the Senior Fitness&#xD;
      Test reflects the process that is taking place in the functional fitness area of people over&#xD;
      60 years of age. Additionally it is possible to observe changes on a continuous basis rather&#xD;
      than in 5-year periods. It also allows to catch the moment when functional fitness&#xD;
      deterioration occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective was to develop centile grids for fitness tests assessing upper and lower&#xD;
      limb muscle strength, flexibility, dynamic balance and endurance, which comprise the Senior&#xD;
      Fitness Test for women over 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Senior Fitness Test is a tool used to determine the functional fitness level of people&#xD;
      over 60 years of age. In order to determine physical fitness levels, Senior Fitness Test was&#xD;
      carried out. The test is comprised of 6 individual test items and for a description of the&#xD;
      trials, please refer to Różańska-Kirschke et al. All fitness tests (1-6) were selected for&#xD;
      analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm Curl (AC) - measurement of upper body muscle endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 30-second Chair Stand (30SCS) - measurement of lower body strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Back Scratch Test (BST) - measurement of upper-body flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Chair Sit and Reach Test (CSRT) - measurement of lower-body flexibility (specifically&#xD;
           hamstring flexibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 8-Foot Up and Go (TUG) - measurement of agility (dynamic balance) and aerobic endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 2-Minute Walk Test (2MWT) - measurement of (aerobic) endurance.&#xD;
