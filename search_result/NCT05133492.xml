  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human study to evaluate the safety and clinical utility of an&#xD;
      investigational medical device called the Nectero EAST System to treat Abdominal Aortic&#xD;
      Aneurysms or AAA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I multi-center, open-label study to evaluate use of the Nectero EAST system&#xD;
      for stabilization of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Thirty (30) subjects will be treated at up&#xD;
      to 10 worldwide sites with the device and followed for up to 36-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: absence of major events within the 1-month follow-up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Success: defined as successful insertion of the delivery catheter and delivery of the&#xD;
           Stabilizer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freedom from aneurysmal sac enlargement. Enlargement is defined as diameter increase of&#xD;
           &gt;5mm per year, or aneurysm sac volume increase of &gt;10% per year, as assessed by CT scans&#xD;
           at the 1, 3, (HK only), 6, 12, 24 and 36-month follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aneurysm sac shrinkage, defined as diameter decrease of &gt;5mm, or decrease in aneurysm&#xD;
           sac volume of &gt;10% as assessed by CT scans at the 1, 3 (HK only), 6, 12, 24 and 36-month&#xD;
           follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of Clinical Utility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration is anticipated to be 6 years.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Endovascular Aneurysm Stabilization Treatment (EAST)</intervention_name>
    <description>Endovascular procedure: an ipsilateral ilio-femoral aortogram to confirm suitability for placement of a 14F sheath will be performed. A baseline contrast aortogram will be performed to assess vessel patency and target location of the EAST delivery catheter. Occluding and Stabilizer balloons are inflated in preparation for Stabilizer Compound delivery within the AAA sac. This takes approximately three minutes. A post-Stabilizer angiogram will re-assess vessel patency and aorta stability. Delivery catheter is removed and discarded. The entire procedure is approximately one hour.</description>
