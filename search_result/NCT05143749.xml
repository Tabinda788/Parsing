  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SarsCov2/COVID19 virus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and cases were seen in our&#xD;
      country about 3 months later, causing a worldwide pandemic. In this process, both the stress&#xD;
      caused by the risk of contracting the disease and the social restrictions affected life&#xD;
      deeply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      578 / 5000 Çeviri sonuçları This study will be beneficial for the assistant doctors in&#xD;
      recognizing technical errors in gynecological operations, reducing the risks and improving&#xD;
      the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical operation trainings such as hysterectomy and oophorectomy fistula surgery can be&#xD;
      given with laparotomy-guided simulators, which can offer interactive training for&#xD;
      gynecological operations in adult female sizes and show high adaptability. However, it is not&#xD;
      possible to train major vaginal surgical operations with this method today. At this point,&#xD;
      video tutorials can be used. This study was planned with the aim of increasing the level of&#xD;
      anxiety about the training of the residents during the pandemic period, with the aim of&#xD;
      making positive changes in order to increase the assistant's own skills, realize his mistakes&#xD;
      and reduce the level of anxiety with video training.&#xD;

      Our study is a Prospective Cross-sectional Case Control study. Our study is a training study&#xD;
      and our assistants included in the study will consist of two groups. Group 1: A total of 10&#xD;
      assistants who have just completed the gynecological surgery training, which is in the last 4&#xD;
      months of a total of 8 months of training during the pandemic process, and Group 2 is 4 . It&#xD;
      will consist of 10 assistants who have just started their surgical training after the first&#xD;
      month. The assistants in Group 2 will videotape their first, fifth, tenth, fifteenth and&#xD;
      twentieth gynecological operations, then watch their own operations to test their skills.&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained from the patients for the video recording of the operations,&#xD;
      stating that the operations will be used for educational purposes only before the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operations are planned as abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy and myomectomy, which&#xD;
      are the most performed gynecological operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video applied to the residents in Group 1, who completed their training in the last 4 months&#xD;
      of the pandemic process, and to the residents in Group 2, who completed their training by&#xD;
      watching the video footage of their own operations, by applying the Self-Confidence Scale,&#xD;
      General Self-Efficacy Scale, State Anxiety Inventory (DCI) and Trait Anxiety Inventory (SCI)&#xD;
      scales. The effect of education on residents' anxiety, competence and self-confidence will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the training, the operations performed by the residents will be analyzed and the&#xD;
      average operation time, intraoperative and postoperative major and minor complication rates,&#xD;
      bleeding amounts in the operations, preoperative and postoperative hemogram amounts,&#xD;
      postoperative hospital stay of the patients, postoperative analgesia need parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated and a comparison will be made between the two groups. In this way, the effect of&#xD;
      video training on the lurning curve will be investigated.&#xD;
