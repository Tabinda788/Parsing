  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic sciatica is a frequent problem whose symptoms could be related to the abnormal&#xD;
      stresses applied to the musculoskeletal system during the gait cycle due to foot alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to describe the main foot alterations in patients with&#xD;
      chronic sciatica, and to evaluate whether foot orthoses can help alleviate this pain.&#xD;
      Patients with chronic sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomly allocate to one of both groups: one group that will be treated with custom-made foot&#xD;
      orthoses, and one group that will be treated with a placebo orthotic device. Quality of life,&#xD;
      pain in low-back, lower limb and foot, and disability caused by foot pain will be recorded at&#xD;
      baseline, and after a two-month follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre randomised controlled clinical trial has been designed according to the&#xD;
      CONSORT guidelines. The design was carried out by the research group (5 researchers, Ph.D and&#xD;
      Degree in Podiatry, from the University of Seville and 2 researchers, Medicine Doctors, from&#xD;
      the university hospital &quot;Virgen de Valme&quot;, in Seville, Spain). The patients will be diagnosed&#xD;
      and recruited from the aforementioned hospital. The data will be gathered in the Clinical&#xD;
      Area of Podiatry of the University of Seville.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main inclusion criteria will be to have a medical diagnosis of chronic sciatica (CS)&#xD;
      caused by lumbar disc herniation (LDH). All participants who voluntarily take part in the&#xD;
      study will be given an informative document where the nature, objectives, and potential risks&#xD;
      of the investigation are explained. When the participants have read it and any doubts have&#xD;
      been resolved, the informed consent will be given for them to sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, clinical and demographic data will be collected, including age, gender, weight,&#xD;
      height, years since diagnosis and current pharmacological management. Patients with CS will&#xD;
      be explored and the Foot Posture Index (FPI) (a validated method for quantifying standing&#xD;
      foot posture), and the Manchester scale for hallux valgus will be recorded for both the right&#xD;
      and left foot. Plantar pressure will be obtained using the footscan® Advanced Pressure&#xD;
      Measurement System (RsScan Lab LTD, UK). Standard podiatric care will be provided to the&#xD;
      patients at the assessment session and when finished the follow up three months later, if&#xD;
      needed. Participants will be requested not to have further foot interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the biomechanical examination, phenolic foam molds will be made of the patient's feet&#xD;
      under weight-bearing conditions. The patient's foot will be manipulated before being&#xD;
      introduced into the phenolic foam so as to place the subtalar joint in the most neutral&#xD;
      position possible, always maintaining the forefoot plantar plane parallel to the ground. In&#xD;
      the case of FPI values between +6 and +12, the examiner will hold the distal third of the&#xD;
      participant's leg and apply external rotational force to the leg until the mirror of the&#xD;
      pedoscope shows incipient loss of the first ray footprint that is, that the first metatarsal&#xD;
      begins to elevate. At that moment, the examiner will stop applying external rotational force&#xD;
      to the leg. The examiner will repeat this manoeuvre several times, as the external rotation&#xD;
      applied to the foot in contact with the glass will be the same as that applied when&#xD;
      introducing the foot into the phenolic foam. The same procedure but with internal rotation of&#xD;
      the leg will be carried out for FPI values between -12 to -1. For feet with FPI values&#xD;
      between 0 and +5, the examiner's hands will apply resistance against pronation or supination&#xD;
      in order to maintain the foot in a normal posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For foot orthoses delivery one researcher will verify the fitting of the orthosis to the&#xD;
      patient's foot. Then the orthosis will be set into shoes. Finally, the participants will be&#xD;
      asked if the insoles cause them pain or discomfort in every session. Both interventions have&#xD;
      the same protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software AleatorMetod.xls, available at www4.ujaen.es/~mramos/EPIP/AleatorMetod.xls, will&#xD;
      be used to randomly allocate the participants into two groups, and this allocation will be&#xD;
      concealed in envelopes. The simple randomisation process will be carried out according to the&#xD;
      order of appointment, so that the first patient treated will be number 1. The participants&#xD;
      themselves will choose the day and time to attend the Podiatric Clinical Area without knowing&#xD;
      the order number that participants have or the corresponding random assignment. Group A will&#xD;
      be the experimental group and will receive the custom-made foot orthoses and Group B will be&#xD;
      the control group and will be given the placebo treatment. Both groups will be followed up&#xD;
      for 3 months, and the data related to foot pain, be recorded monthly by phone. This phone&#xD;
      call will remind the participants to appropriately use the orthoses during the follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is pain within the foot, lower extremity and lumbar region. Visual&#xD;
      analogue scale will be used to record pain at baseline and at the end of the follow-up&#xD;
      period, and self-reported pain intensity once a month by phone call will be assessed with an&#xD;
      11-point NPRS with 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as it can be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be disability related to foot pain, and quality of life. Disability&#xD;
      related to foot pain will be measured using the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index&#xD;
      (MFPDI) at baseline and at the end of the follow-up period. The values of this index range&#xD;
      from 0 to 38, with higher values corresponding to greater disability. The SF-12 questionnaire&#xD;
      will be used to collect data about the quality of life. This has values between 0 and 100,&#xD;
      with higher values corresponding to a lower quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will be blinded, as will not know what group belong to and the type of&#xD;
      orthoses that will be given in the study (intervention or placebo). Patients will only be&#xD;
      informed that the research will evaluate this treatment to manage pain in patients with CS&#xD;
      caused by LDH. The participants will be requested to use the foot orthoses assigned seven&#xD;
      days a week for a minimum of eight hours per day for three months. The researcher who&#xD;
      performs the measurements at days 0, 30, 60, and 90 will not be the same researcher who&#xD;
      conducts the randomisation, adapts the foot orthoses, and gives them to the participants.&#xD;
      Thus, researchers will be blinded as well. Adverse events will be recorded as part of the&#xD;
      monitoring and appropriate safety measures. The participants will be asked about any problems&#xD;
      with the foot orthoses and their adaptation to the footwear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size was calculated using the following formula to compare mean values&#xD;
      between populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = (2s^2 (z_(α/2) + z_β))/d^2, where s2 is the sample variance, α is the type I error, β is&#xD;
      the type II error, and d is the minimum difference to be detected. According to previous&#xD;
      studies, the variance of the visual analogue scale for pain is equal to 400, and the&#xD;
      difference found is 16. Therefore, the following result was obtained: n = (2s^2 (z_(α/2) +&#xD;
      z_β))/d^2 = 〖2 ∙ 400 ∙ (1.96+0.84)〗^2/16^2 = 24.5 = 25 Thus, at least 25 people will be&#xD;
      needed in each group to compare the mean values. In this study, 100 patients will be&#xD;
      initially recruited, with 50 in each group, in consideration of possible losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the data will becarried out using the statistical software IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The descriptive data will provide the mean values and the&#xD;
      standard deviations or the absolute frequencies and percentages depending on whether the&#xD;
      variables are scalar or categorical. Shapiro-Wilk tests will be conducted for the inferential&#xD;
      analysis to determine the most appropriate test to use. When the data show a normal&#xD;
      distribution by groups, a t-test for independent samples will be carried out. Mann-Whitney's&#xD;
      U test will be used for the independent samples when there is no normal distribution. For&#xD;
      those study variables that will be measured four times, the tests will be conducted in pairs&#xD;
      for related samples as well. The t-test will be used if the variables show a normal&#xD;
      distribution in the four measurements, and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test will be used for&#xD;
      related samples when do not. When statistically significant differences are found according&#xD;
      to the P-value, the effect size will be calculated using Cohen's d or Rosenthal's r to&#xD;
      analyse the magnitude of the differences. The differences will be classified according to the&#xD;
      following for both parameters: below 0.2: no effect; 0.2-0.5: small effect; 0.5-0.8: medium&#xD;
      effect; and above 0.8: large effect. The analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat data&#xD;
      set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of the variables for which randomisation produces differences between groups at&#xD;
      the initial assessment, repeated-measures analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) with the baseline&#xD;
      scores as covariates will be performed to enable comparisons of post-intervention data after&#xD;
      adjusting for those differences in the initial scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confidence level a priori is 95%. For missing data (participant withdrawal or interim&#xD;
      missing data), the convenience of several missing data models (i.e., 'missing at random',&#xD;
      'missing completely at random' or 'missing not at random') will be classified by the trial&#xD;
      personnel (according to available trial data). The most appropriate missing data model will&#xD;
      be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring will be evaluated in collaboration with an external Statistician, who will&#xD;
      also review all the issues related to data collection and analysis during the research&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
