  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the tolerability of&#xD;
      MHS 1031. Tolerability will be assessed using the change in complete spontaneous bowel&#xD;
      movements (CSBM), PRO questionnaires, concomitant medication assessments, and assessment of&#xD;
      adverse events, from baseline (determined during Screening Phase) to Week 8 (Day 56). The&#xD;
      primary analysis will be conducted to assess the tolerability of MHS 1031 product and of the&#xD;
      formulated placebo in randomized subjects with CIC diagnosed according to a modified Rome IV&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the tolerability of MHS 1031 and tolerability of the formulated placebo.&#xD;
      The study consists of a screening phase to establish eligibility and baseline values,&#xD;
      followed by 3 distinct study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with CIC will be determined eligible for the study based on modified Rome IV&#xD;
      criteria during a 2 week Screening Phase. Approximately 200 subjects with CIC who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with equal numbers of each in each&#xD;
      successive group of 50 subjects, to receive either MHS 1031 [1 g (1.4 ml) per day] or 1.4 ml&#xD;
      of placebo (1:1) for 8 weeks (Product/Placebo Phase). Upon completion of the 8 week&#xD;
      Product/Placebo Phase, Subjects will enter a 4 week open label Product Phase, during which&#xD;
      all subjects will receive MHS 1031. Subjects who complete the study will enter a 2-week&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase, during which subjects will take neither placebo nor MHS 1031.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, tolerability will be assessed on the basis of Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      (PRO questionnaires), concomitant medication assessments, and assessment of adverse events.&#xD;
      Tolerability is defined as no overall worsening of constipation measurement scores after 8&#xD;
      weeks of taking the product or the placebo compared to baseline scores.&#xD;

    <description>A Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (CSBM) is a Bowel Movement (BM) that occurs in the absence of laxative use within 24 hours of the BM and the patient reports a feeling of complete evacuation. Tolerability is defined as no overall worsening of constipation measurement scores after 8 weeks of taking the product or the placebo compared to baseline scores. More complete spontaneous bowel movements is better, fewer is worse.</description>
