  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the acceptability and effectiveness of an individualized&#xD;
      eating strategy as part of diabetes self-management to improve glycemic levels among youth&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and suboptimal glycemic management. Investigators will assess&#xD;
      participant acceptability of and adherence to a 6-month individualized eating strategy&#xD;
      (&quot;MyPlan&quot;) characterized by approximate day-to-day consistency in the frequency and timing of&#xD;
      meals and snacks and distribution of carbohydrate throughout the day. Within-individual&#xD;
      change in glycemic levels between baseline and 6-months of the study will also be compared.&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to inform the design of a future randomized clinical trial to test&#xD;
      the addition of the MyPlan eating strategy to ongoing diabetes clinical care among youth with&#xD;
      T1D.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, single-arm clinical trial to assess whether &quot;MyPlan&quot; is an acceptable and&#xD;
      effective dietary strategy to be included in future fully powered trials aimed at optimizing&#xD;
      diabetes outcomes in youth with T1D. Youth and guardian dyads will be enrolled for a total of&#xD;
      6 months, during which time dyads will be counseled to follow an individualized eating plan&#xD;
      defined by five eating behavior goals: 3-4 meals per day and 1-2 optional snacks; eating&#xD;
      occasions no less than 2 hours or greater than 4 hours apart; target carbohydrate ranges for&#xD;
      each eating occasion; no post-dinner snacking; eating occasion within 1-2 hours of waking.&#xD;
      The plan, including the eating behavior goals, will be tailored to youth and family routines&#xD;
      and preferences. Registered dieticians will support participant adherence to the plan via&#xD;
      telehealth counseling sessions on a weekly basis for the first 2 months followed by bi-weekly&#xD;
      sessions for 4 months. Investigators will assess a) acceptability of the eating plan and&#xD;
      counseling strategy according to youth and guardians; b) youth adherence to the five eating&#xD;
      behavior targets; c) change in youth glycemic levels between baseline and 6-months.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>&quot;MyPlan&quot; - Individualized Structured Eating Plan</intervention_name>
    <description>Sessions involve a structured behavior change counseling module derived from FLEX (NCT01286350), DASH-4-Teens (NCT00585832), and a Social Cognitive Theory and Transtheoretical Model informed conceptual framework, which uses education, motivation and self-efficacy enhancement, goal setting, and problem-solving skills training to initiate and sustain eating plan adherence. Sessions support incremental progress towards meeting all five eating behavior goals by helping youth develop action plans, troubleshoot barriers to adherence, and refine action plans to improve adherence. Youth log in MyFitnessPal three days per week. Logs are used to assess and troubleshoot adherence, support youth in developing and refining action plans, and reward youth with points. Incentives are allocated using a point scheme designed to promote logging and goal achievement. Formal adjustment of eating plan at three months is based on weight status, adherence according to logs, and youth/guardian acceptability.</description>
