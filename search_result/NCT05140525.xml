  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to determine the effects of combination medical therapy&#xD;
      (Riociguat and Macitentan) and balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) on hemodynamics and right&#xD;
      ventricular (RV) function (including advanced assessments of RV-pulmonary artery (PA)&#xD;
      coupling from invasive hemodynamics) in participants with inoperable or post-PTE residual&#xD;
      CTEPH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent presented but unpublished results from trials of BPA vs riociguat for inoperable CTEPH&#xD;
      (NCT02634203) have demonstrated that BPA provides a more significant hemodynamic benefit than&#xD;
      medical therapy. The investigators hypothesize that participants who are treated with upfront&#xD;
      combination medical therapy followed by BPA will have significant improvements in their&#xD;
      hemodynamics and RV-PA coupling that can be monitored over time.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in end-systolic elastance (Ees) divided by arterial elastance (Ea) (Ees/Ea) at three time points: Baseline, Timepoint 1 and Timepoint 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before starting all treatments); Timepoint 1 (after starting medical therapy; up to 6 months after baseline); Timepoint 2 (after balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA); up to 12 months after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Ees is a measure of right ventricular (RV) - pulmonary arterial (PA) coupling, with a normal value of Ees/Ea &gt; 0.8 (dimensionless - no units). For subjects with Ees/Ea &gt; 0.8 at the start of the study, we will evaluate the absolute change in Ees/Ea between timepoints. For those with an Ees/Ea &lt; 0.8, we will also determine whether participants have an improvement to &gt; 0.8.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cardiac index as measured by liters per minute per meters squared at right heart catheterization.</measure>

    <description>Right heart catheterization will be performed at baseline, timepoint 1 and timepoint 2 and parameters determined. Absolute change between these timepoints will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Change in pulmonary vascular resistance as measured by Wood units at right heart catheterization.</measure>
