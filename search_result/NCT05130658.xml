  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) based&#xD;
      treadmill training on walking ability. The study will also help to understand the changes in&#xD;
      cognitive ability and brain activity as a result of VR-based treadmill training after a brain&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 3 groups: C-MILL training group (CTG), Treadmill training group (TTG),&#xD;
      and healthy control group (HCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with brain injury will be randomly assigned to C-MILL training group, or&#xD;
      Treadmill training group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTG and TTG will participate in up to 13 sessions. The participants will be screened for&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria and consented during the first session. They will&#xD;
      participate in two data collection sessions, one before the training and one after the&#xD;
      training. The participants will undergo 10 training sessions. Individuals in the CTG will&#xD;
      receive gait and balance training sessions with the virtual reality and auditory cues using&#xD;
      C-MILL (such as walking on a pathway, obstacle avoidance, lateral balance etc.) to provide&#xD;
      task specific training. C-Mill (Motekforce Link, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) is an&#xD;
      instrumented treadmill that uses visual (on the screen as well on the treadmill) and acoustic&#xD;
      cues for gait and balance training. The C-Mill allows for gait and balance adaptability&#xD;
      strategy as it can provide obstacle avoidance environments, change in speed and various&#xD;
      walking pathways in a safe and controlled environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in TTG group will walk on the treadmill (C-MILL) or stand on the treadmill&#xD;
      (C-MILL) with no visual or auditory cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCG will participate in up to four sessions. The participants will be screened for the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and consented during the first session. They will participate in&#xD;
      two data collection sessions and one C-MILLsession.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each training session will last for 45 minutes. During the 45 minutes, the participants will&#xD;
      perform the task for approximately 1 minute. Participants will be allowed as much rest as&#xD;
      needed by them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training all participants will wear the safety harness to protect from falling. In&#xD;
      addition spotter will be present with the participants to prevent falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's baseline and follow up data will be collected for a) functional b)&#xD;
      neuromechanical c) cortical and d) cognitive outcomes. During walking on treadmill data will&#xD;
      also be collected with instrumented C- MILL. C-MILL can provide gait parameters such as step&#xD;
      length, width, frequency, speed and symmetry in addition to center of pressure for evaluation&#xD;
      of gait and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Training Sessions: The instrumented treadmill will collect force data during training.&#xD;
