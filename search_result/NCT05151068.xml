      To study the effect of acupoint application combined with ear acupoint seeding on the&#xD;
      discomfort symptoms of nasal catheter in patients after esophageal cancer surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January to December 2021, 200 patients after esophageal cancer surgery with nasal&#xD;
      catherterization in an affiliated hospital of Soochow will be selected as the research&#xD;
      objects, and they will be divided into experimental group (100 cases) and control group (100&#xD;
      cases) by random number table method. The control group will receive routine nursing care,&#xD;
      and the experimental group will implement a precision nursing program of acupoint application&#xD;
      combined with ear acupoint embedding on the basis of the control group. The thirst, throat&#xD;
      pain, comfort, sleep, and unplanned extubation rate will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;

    <description>Unplanned extubation refers to the early withdrawal of the catheter due to various reasons before the end of the treatment. This study includes the partial or complete extubation of the patient during the catheterization period. The calculation formula: (The number of cases of unplanned extubation in the group/the number of patients in the same group during the same period) × 100%.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of thirst</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluate at 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 7 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Thirst is assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the higher the score, the more severe the patients' thirst .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of throe throat</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluate at 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 7 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Thore throat is evaluated by NRS. The higher the score, the more severe the throat pain of the patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluate at admission, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The comfort state is evaluated by Gnneral comfort questionnaire(GCQ). The scale includes 4 dimensions of physiology, psychology, spirit, social culture and environment, with a total of 28 items. The higher the score, the better the patient's comfort state.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluate at admission, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep is evaluated using Athens insomnia scale (AIS). The higher the score, the worse the quality of sleep.</description>

    <description>The control group is given conventional nursing care: ①Preoperative education, informing patients of the importance of the tube and the adverse effects of unauthorised extubation after the operation on the recovery of the disease. ②Pipe care: The nose wing is fixed with modified &quot;human&quot; elastic tape, and the same side cheek bridge is fixed to keep the duct unobstructed and pour gastric juice in time. ③Oral care: routinely brush teeth and gargle with mouthwash daily. ④Skin care: Observe the condition of the nose, cheek skin and oral and nasal mucosa. Replace the tape as needed, and clean the skin before fixing. ⑤ Pain care: assess the degree of pain, follow the doctor's prescription for medication, and observe the efficacy of medication. ⑥Psychological care: pay attention to the emotional changes of patients and provide psychological support.This group is planned to enroll 100 patients.</description>
