  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized feasibility trial to determine the feasibility of comparing two&#xD;
      different shoe inserts and on pain, quality of life and physical activity associated with hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to one of two groups - contoured prefabricated foot orthoses&#xD;
      or flat shoe inserts (the comparator). Participants will be asked to use the inserts daily&#xD;
      for a six week period. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored using a daily diary,&#xD;
      as well as adverse events and co-interventions. The primary outcome is feasibility domains&#xD;
      (Demand, Implementation, Acceptability, Practicality) with secondary outcomes of change in&#xD;
      hip-related pain and quality of life and physical activity levels. The primary time-point&#xD;
      will be 6-weeks.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Assessor blinding: Participants complete their own outcome measures (questionnaires) online and are thus not blind. Accelerometry data will be assessor blinded. All outcome measures will be analysed by an investigator blind to participant group allocation. Participants will be instructed not to divulge any aspect of their intervention to the research assistant conducting follow-up assessments.&#xD;
Participant blinding: Participants will be advised that they have an equal chance of being allocated to the either shoe insert, and thus are blind to allocation. Participants will also be blind to the study hypothesis, so they are unaware which of the interventions is 'active'.&#xD;
Physiotherapist blinding: It is not possible to blind the trial physiotherapist to group allocation. Trial Physiotherapists will however not be involved in assessment of outcome measures.</masking_description>
