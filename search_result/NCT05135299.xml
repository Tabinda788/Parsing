  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) is the second most frequent surgical condition in&#xD;
      emergency departments, the complication rate of ACC is 8-20%, and the mortality rate is&#xD;
      0.5-6% in recent series. The Tokyo Guidelines (TG) advocate for different risk factors and&#xD;
      initial treatments of ACC with no clear evidence that all patients will benefit from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to identify the risk factors for complications in ACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a retrospective cohort study conducted from January 2011 to December 2016 in a single&#xD;
      center with a dedicated surgical emergency unit in a Metropolitan University Hospital in&#xD;
      Barcelona, Spain. The analysis of the data was finished in March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study candidates comprised 963 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of ACC according to&#xD;
      the TG18 and/or received a diagnosis of ACC in the Pathology report in those that an emergent&#xD;
      cholecystectomy was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study case definition was a 'Pure Acute Cholecystitis' (pure ACC); therefore, patients&#xD;
      with any other concomitant diagnosis potentially influencing outcome (Postoperative&#xD;
      cholecystitis, Acute Cholangitis, Acute Pancreatitis, Incidental Cholecystectomy, Acalculous&#xD;
      Cholecystitis, Chronic Cholecystitis/Persistent Colic, Post-endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      pancreato-cholangiography, or Neoplasia) were excluded from the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary data were available from a prospective database maintained in File Maker v.12&#xD;
      (Mountainview, CA, USA), which included basic demographic data, type of interventions, sex,&#xD;
      days of admission, and complications. Every record was completed by browsing the electronic&#xD;
      patient record, adding laboratory and microbiology data, as well as antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      duration of procedure, additional procedures, and grade of acute cholecystitis according to&#xD;
      the TG18 diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative comorbidities were assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index and surgical&#xD;
      risk by ASA classification. The type of initial treatment was classified as Surgical&#xD;
      Treatment (Cholecystectomy either by laparoscopy or laparotomy) or Non-Surgical Treatment,&#xD;
      which was either percutaneous cholecystostomy or intravenous antibiotics alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure was the mortality after the diagnostic of ACC. In the patients that&#xD;
      were discharged, 30 days after the diagnosis, if the patients was not discharged in 30 days,&#xD;
      at any time during the same admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received intravenous antibiotic therapy from the moment the diagnosis was&#xD;
      formulated, according to a fixed protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided cholecystostomy was performed percutaneously with an 8-Fr catheter (SKATER&#xD;
      ™, Argon Medical Devices, Rochester, NY, USA) by either transhepatic or transperitoneal&#xD;
      insertion, at the discretion of the radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy was performed according to the French technique using 4&#xD;
      trochars. The content of the gallbladder was evacuated by Veress needle puncture when&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discrimination power of the model was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC)&#xD;
      curves and was compared with the DeLong method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legal and Ethical considerations This study was approved by the clinical research ethical&#xD;
      committee of the Hospital del Mar and was classified as a non-clinical trial.&#xD;
