    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is a randomized, double-blind, single- and multiple-ascending dose trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, food-effect, and pharmacokinetics of TP-05 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects will be enrolled in 5 sequential, ascending single dose cohorts and 3&#xD;
      multiple, ascending dose cohorts. Dose escalation will be approved by a safety monitoring&#xD;
      committee before beginning the next cohort. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate&#xD;
      if any dose-limiting adverse events (AEs) through Day 15 (in Cohorts 1-5) or through Day 36&#xD;
      (in Cohorts 6-8) occurred in a cohort before proceeding to dosing in the next dose level. In&#xD;
      addition, the SRC will review selected PK parameters after selected cohorts. Skin punch&#xD;
      biopsies, and venous, capillary, and urine samples may be collected at various timepoints for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic analysis. Safety assessments include monitoring of adverse events, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory testing, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and ECGs. A blood sample&#xD;
      may also be collected to evaluate tick mortality upon exposure.&#xD;
