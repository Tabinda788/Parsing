  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for multiple night testing is well recognized in sleep medicine because of a&#xD;
      considerable and relevant night-to-night variability. In a study with multiple recordings&#xD;
      using WatchPAT®, the OSA severity of 24% of patients was misclassified when using one night&#xD;
      compared to the average of three nights. On average, pAHI varied by 57% from night-to-night.&#xD;
      The variability of pAHI could partially be explained by the variability of time spent in the&#xD;
      supine position with more time supine leading to a higher pAHI (Tschopp et al 2021). Smith&#xD;
      (2007) suggested that the AHI should be indicated with a confidence interval to indicate the&#xD;
      uncertainty regarding its true value. The Minimal Detectable Difference (MDD) is of special&#xD;
      interest in sleep medicine, especially when assessing treatment effects. MDD was found to be&#xD;
      12.8/h and the standard error of measurement was 4.6/h for 4 nights of polysomnography (Aarab&#xD;
      et al. 2008). For WatchPAT®, measuring two and three nights showed a small reduction in MDD&#xD;
      from 19.1/h to 18.0/h (Tschopp et al. 2021, in press). Only one study using pulse oximetry&#xD;
      assessed the night-to-night variability over 14 days (Stöberl A. et al 2017). The study&#xD;
      confirmed the enormous variability and focused mainly on its impact on OSA severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the night-to-night variability has been extensively studied for polysomnography,&#xD;
      respiratory polygraphy, and WatchPAT®, little is known about the optimal number of nights to&#xD;
      be recorded. There is convincing evidence from the literature, that the recording of multiple&#xD;
      nights is the only way to assess the severity of the patient's disease with clinically&#xD;
      reasonable accuracy. Moreover, the MDD with only one night's recording is astonishingly high.&#xD;
      The question is how many nights should be recorded to achieve acceptable diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
      The precision of the OSA measurement depends on the clinical situation. For example, to&#xD;
      diagnose severe OSA, a higher variability might be acceptable without influencing the&#xD;
      treatment decision. However, when comparing treatment effects, the MDD should be as small as&#xD;
      possible. The recording of multiple nights might be cumbersome for patients (e.g. with&#xD;
      polysomnography or respiratory polygraphy) as well as costly. These factors have to be taken&#xD;
      into consideration for the clinically feasible number of recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleepiz One Connect offers the unique opportunity for a contactless recording of breathing&#xD;
      combined with conventional pulse oximetry and is a minimally invasive diagnostic tool that&#xD;
      allows measurements over several nights. Studies with multiple night recordings will offer a&#xD;
      basis for diagnostic recommendations in future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate the variability of obstructive sleep apnea at-home sleep apnea&#xD;
      testing. By investigating the variability, we want to quantify the improvement in diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy by additional measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that additional recordings offer a significant improvement in diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy by reducing the variability. The reduction in variability will diminish with each&#xD;
      additional recording.&#xD;
