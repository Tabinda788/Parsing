  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of conestat alfa (Ruconest®,&#xD;
      Pharming Technologies B.V.) on renal and cerebral ischemic events in patients undergoing TAVI&#xD;
      for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) compared to placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a frequent valvular heart disease in the elderly with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 4 to 10% and a mean survival of only 0.5 to 5 years if left untreated.&#xD;
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved as standard of care for high-,&#xD;
      intermediate and potentially even low surgical risk candidates due to a lower perioperative&#xD;
      risk compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Despite its relative safety&#xD;
      compared to SAVR, embolic events originating from the calcified valve and leading to ischemic&#xD;
      stroke and acute renal injury are major complications following TAVI in the acute and&#xD;
      subacute period, and are associated with increased morbidity including cognitive decline and&#xD;
      mortality. While cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) such as the Sentinel® CEPD&#xD;
      (Boston Scientific) were designed to reduce the burden of cerebral embolic events, their&#xD;
      impact on clinical events has yet to be determined, and other prophylactic options are&#xD;
      currently not available. Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a key pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanism involved in cerebral and renal embolic events after TAVI resulting in activation of&#xD;
      endothelial cells, the contact activation and the complement system and attraction of&#xD;
      neutrophils to the site of injury. In this regard, recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor&#xD;
      (rhC1INH, conestat alfa), a potent inhibitor of the complement and the contact system has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce the size of cerebral ischemic damage and of renal injury in experimental&#xD;
      IRI models, and has successfully been investigated in a pilot study of acute kidney injury&#xD;
      following the administration of contrast media. The aim of the current trial is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of conestat alfa (Ruconest®, Pharming Technologies B.V.) on renal and&#xD;
      cerebral ischemic events in patients undergoing TAVI for severe symptomatic AS compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

    <description>In the current study, participants will receive two intravenous injections of conestat alfa (immediately during the TAVI procedure and again 3h later) at a dose of 100 U/kg (first dose) and of 50 U/kg (subsequent dose), for patients less than 84 kg; two intravenous injections (immediately during the TAVI procedure and again 4h later) of conestat at a dose of 8400 U (4 vials, first dose) and of 4200 U (2 vials, subsequent dose) for patients of 84 kg body weight or greater. The chosen regimen including repeated administration should increase and maintain serum C1INH levels above twice the serum concentration for six to eight hours in the majority of patients. The timeframe of therapeutic concentrations will cover the period of the TAVI procedure itself and the immediate postprocedural period during which reperfusion and additional ischemic events related to global hypoperfusion may occur.</description>
