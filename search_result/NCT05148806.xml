      DESIGN Observational epidemiological study&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS - To determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of immunosuppressed people who have detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies&#xD;
           following a primary vaccine course (3 doses), and the demographic, disease, and&#xD;
           treatment characteristics that influence antibody status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the detection of antibodies inversely correlates with subsequent risk of severe acute&#xD;
           respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection and/or severity of disease in&#xD;
           immunosuppressed people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this proposal is to assess at a population level; 1) the proportion of&#xD;
      immunosuppressed people who have detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following a primary vaccine&#xD;
      course (3 doses), and the sociodemographic, disease, and treatment characteristics that&#xD;
      influence antibody status; 2) if the detection of antibodies inversely correlates with&#xD;
      subsequent risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and/or severity of disease in immunosuppressed&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to target patient groups least likely to mount an immune response to vaccination; a)&#xD;
      solid organ transplant recipients; b) patients with a rare autoimmune disease c) patients&#xD;
      with haematological malignancies, specifically lymphoid malignancies. We will use&#xD;
      comprehensive registries to identify and recruit patients from these groups, and utilise the&#xD;
      existing linkages these registries already have to obtain COVID-19 outcome information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that a sizeable proportion of immunosuppressed people will have no detectable&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following a three vaccine doses, and that this cohort is particularly&#xD;
      susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and death.&#xD;
