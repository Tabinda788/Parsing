  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder causing troublesome symptoms and&#xD;
      reduced quality of life. It affects 10-20% of the population, hence creates large costs for&#xD;
      society. About 30-40% of all IBS patients do not benefit from current treatment options.&#xD;
      Sucrase-isomaltase (SI) deficiency is an unexplored condition, that may explain symptoms in&#xD;
      IBS patients who experience no effect from today's treatments. Currently, a duodenal biopsy&#xD;
      is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SI deficiency, however the condition is not well&#xD;
      investigated. A 13C-labelled breath test holds promise as a non-invasive alternative, but it&#xD;
      has not previously been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will address the knowledge gap related to a possible association between SI&#xD;
      deficiency and IBS by addressing two research questions that have never been answered before.&#xD;
      We aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate the 13C-labelled breath test as a diagnostic tool by assessing the strength of&#xD;
           the association between the breath test and SI activity measured in duodenal biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the 13C-labelled breath test in a randomized dietary crossover trial comparing a&#xD;
           starch and sucrose reduced diet (SSRD) with the standard low-FODMAP diet in IBS&#xD;
           patients, to evaluate whether SI activity is associated with dietary changes according&#xD;
           to symptom severity and gut microbiota composition&#xD;

      The projects includes two studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Validation of the 13C-labelled breath test to diagnose sucrase-isomaltase deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: In order to validate the 13C-sucrose breath test to diagnose SI deficiency, the&#xD;
      test result must be compared to the &quot;gold standard&quot; method for diagnosis; i.e. measurements&#xD;
      of enzyme activity from intestinal biopsies by &quot;The Dahlquist Method&quot;, and a reference&#xD;
      material must be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare results from the 13C-labelled breath test to enzyme activity measured&#xD;
      in biopsies collected from the proximal small intestine in a limited patient group referred&#xD;
      for a gastroscopic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: SI activity as measured with a breath test and enzyme activity with assay&#xD;
      of biopsy material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and patient characteristics: Patients referred for gastroscopic examination with&#xD;
      duodenal biopsies and with suspected GI disorder, will be included consecutively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: We aim to include 40 patients. No studies validating breath test results in our&#xD;
      patient group are available. However, based on preliminary results suggesting that 35% of IBS&#xD;
      patients have SI deficiency,13 we are 95% likely to find between 8 and 21 patients with SI&#xD;
      deficiency when examining 40 patients. Assuming 80% concordance between the two methods to&#xD;
      (correct proportion of successes), we would need 12 positive cases. Thus, if 40 individuals&#xD;
      are included, the study is sufficiently powered (alpha=5% and beta=20%, using McNemar's test&#xD;
      of concordance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency as a cause of symptoms in patients with irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To examine the effect of a 4-week SSRD on GI- and extraintestinal symptoms, gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition and fecal fermentation in patients with IBS (with and without SI&#xD;
      deficiency), and compare the SSRD with a 4-week low-FODMAP diet to investigate whether the&#xD;
      patients with a breath test result indicating SI deficiency respond better to the SSRD than&#xD;
      the patients with normal SI activity. Gut microbiota have been suggested to have a central&#xD;
      role in IBS etiology, hence evaluation of gut microbiota composition and fecal fermentation&#xD;
      will be included to increase the knowledge regarding the effects of dietary change on gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition and activity related to SI deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized, open clinical crossover trial with a dietary intervention in a group of&#xD;
      IBS patients, lasting for 4+4 weeks (SSRD vs. low-FODMAP) with a 1-week wash-out period in&#xD;
      between. Breath tests will be taken at inclusion, but the results will be &quot;blinded&quot;, e.g. not&#xD;
      available for anyone conducting the trial before end of the study. A SSRD will be compared to&#xD;
      the low-FODMAP diet. All participants will be given dietary advice from a registered clinical&#xD;
      dietitian. Briefly, all forms of sucrose-containing foods (e.g. sweets, jam, and cakes)&#xD;
      should be avoided, and foods rich in starch should be reduced on the SSRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Symptom severity by IBS-Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Gut microbiota composition, fecal fermentation measured by short chain&#xD;
      fatty acids (SCFAs) and assessment of quality of life by the Patient Reported Outcome&#xD;
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and patient characteristics: IBS patients referred to the outpatient clinic at&#xD;
      the Department of Gastroenterology at Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital for dietary guidance by a&#xD;
      registered dietitian will be consecutively included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The primary end point is change in IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS) at the end of&#xD;
      the treatment period relative to baseline, and the proportion of responders to the dietary&#xD;
      intervention is based on the recommended cut-off of a reduction (ie, improvement) in total&#xD;
      IBS-SSS score of 50 points, which is considered to be clinically meaningful improvement. To&#xD;
      plan our sample size, we performed a power calculation based on the ability to detect a&#xD;
      difference between the two diets in reduction of IBS-SSS score of at least 50 points with 80%&#xD;
      power, assuming an SD of 100. The calculation indicated that we would need 64 patients. To&#xD;
      allow for 15-20% drop-out, we aim to include 80 patients.&#xD;
