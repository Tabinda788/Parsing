  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the movement of insulin NNC0363-0845 throughout the&#xD;
      body and how it works for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to improve clinical outcomes for patients with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus by better controlling the blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get insulin NNC0363-0845 as well as insulin detemir (Levemir®).&#xD;
      NNC0363-0845 is a new insulin molecule designed to provide blood sugar-dependent insulin&#xD;
      action, while insulin detemir is commonly used and prescribed by doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get subcutaneous (under your skin) injections of insulin NNC0363-0845&#xD;
      (study medicine) up to 6 times daily for 3 days, and of insulin detemir up to 6 times daily&#xD;
      for another 3 days. Which medication participants receive first and which second, insulin&#xD;
      NNC0363-0845 or insulin detemir, is decided by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 6 weeks up to a maximum of 14 weeks. Participants will have 2&#xD;
      in-house visits (where participants will stay at the site for 4 nights) and 5 outpatient&#xD;
      visits with the study doctor. Participants will have frequent contact with the study doctor&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the in-house visits, two intravenous catheters (a thin tube inserted into a vein) will&#xD;
      be inserted for blood sampling and infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested parties may not participate in the study if the study doctor believes it will&#xD;
      affect their health negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women cannot take part if they are of childbearing potential.&#xD;
