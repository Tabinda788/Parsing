    <textblock>
      A non-blinded two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are: 1) aged ≥65 years, 2) having Hong Kong ID, 3) Chinese speaking, 4) willing to&#xD;
      be followed up by telephone, 5) having a smartphone, and 6) have not received SIV for the&#xD;
      incoming flu season. Exclusion criteria include: 1) cognitive impairment, blindness or&#xD;
      deafness, 2) not able to communicate with others effectively, and 3) with known&#xD;
      contradictions of SIV (allergic to previous SIV, diagnosed/suspected egg allergy, with&#xD;
      bleeding disorder or on warfarin). A total of 396 participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the intervention group (n=198) or the control group (n=198). Intervention group will&#xD;
      watch an online health promotion video tailored to their current stage of change related to&#xD;
      SIV uptake once every two weeks for four times (at week 0, 2, 4, and 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will watch a same online video providing general advices&#xD;
      related to SIV at week 0, 2, 4, and 6. All participants will be followed up by telephone 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after the baseline survey.&#xD;
