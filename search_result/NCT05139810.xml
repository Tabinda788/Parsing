    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donidalorsen in&#xD;
      participants with HAE and effect of donidalorsenon the quality and pattern of HAE attacks and&#xD;
      their impact on quality of life (QoL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of&#xD;
      donidalorsenin up to 84 participants. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      Cohort A (donidalorsenor placebo every 4 weeks) or Cohort B (donidalorsenor placebo every 8&#xD;
      weeks), respectively. Within each Cohort, participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive donidalorsenor matching-placebo. The length of participation in the study is&#xD;
      approximately 11 months, which includes an up to 8-week Screening Period, a 25-week Treatment&#xD;
      Period, and an up to 13-week Post-treatment Period.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who are Well Controlled on the Angioedema Control Test (AECT) at Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The AECT is a validated participant-reported outcome instrument to assess disease activity in participants with recurrent angioedema. The questionnaire consists of four questions asking about the frequency and severity of angioedema experienced in the prior month. Each question has 5 response choices. The AECT can be used to identify participants with poorly controlled disease by working with a cutoff value of greater than or equal to 10 points. Participants who score less than 10 points (0-9) in the AECT have poorly controlled disease whereas participants with controlled disease score 10-16 points. Higher scores will indicate well controlled disease.</description>

    <measure>Change in Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) Questionnaire Total Score at Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The AE-QoL questionnaire is a validated tool to assess symptom-specific health-related QOL impairment in participants suffering from recurrent angioedema. The AE-QoL is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 17 questions across 4 domains: functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and food. The responses are scored from 1 to 5 where, 1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = very often. Total and domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater impairment.</description>
