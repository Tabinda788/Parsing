  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a- 2-arm randomized controlled trial among patients presenting for kidney&#xD;
      transplant evaluation at a single transplant center to compare the effects of a patient-based&#xD;
      self-learning and outreach intervention about living-donor kidney transplantation&#xD;
      (KidneyTIME) versus usual care for living-donor kidney transplant knowledge, concerns,&#xD;
      readiness, access behaviors, and living-donor inquiries over 12 months follow-up. Following&#xD;
      consent and baseline assessment, participants were randomized, stratified by self-reported&#xD;
      race, with equal allocation to 2 treatment arms: the KidneyTIME intervention and usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a 2.5 year period we will conduct a 2-arm parallel randomized trial among patients&#xD;
      presenting for kidney transplant evaluation at a single transplant center to compare the&#xD;
      effects of KidneyTIME versus usual care for KTX access over 12 months of intervention use and&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Transplant program at Erie County Medical Center, a&#xD;
      safety-net hospital in Buffalo, New York. Each week, electronic records will be accessed to&#xD;
      identify potential participants who had been referred to the transplant center for a kidney&#xD;
      transplant, are aged 18 years and older, speak English, have internet access, and did not opt&#xD;
      out after receiving a letter invitation. We will excude patients previously exposed to any&#xD;
      component of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each potential participant will be sent an electronic invitation from the principal&#xD;
      investigator (a transplant surgeon). This message will briefly described the study and&#xD;
      include a personal link to an online consent form describing study procedures and potential&#xD;
      risks. A stakeholder Advisory Council, whose members include patients and care partners, will&#xD;
      review and provide ongoing feedback on the recruitment and retention plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study and the progress tracker will be hosted on Alchemer. Those who sign&#xD;
      electronic consent to participate will be automatically guided to a baseline sociodemographic&#xD;
      survey (T0). Upon completion, computer-generated randomization will stratify participants by&#xD;
      self-reported race (Black versus Other), with equal allocation to 2 treatment arms: the&#xD;
      KidneyTIME intervention and usual care. Condition assignment of each participant will be&#xD;
      concealed from transplant providers, but participants will become aware of their treatment&#xD;
      assignment one they access the study educational content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KidneyTIME is a self-directed digital intervention. It contains 26 animated videos, each 1-3&#xD;
      minutes in length, designed to address knowledge gaps and concerns about kidney&#xD;
      transplantation and living donation that were identified in literature reviews, formative&#xD;
      research, and video development studies as critical for optimal prospective kidney recipient&#xD;
      and donor participation in LDKT. All components of the intervention were developed through a&#xD;
      user-centered design approach by involving kidney failure patients and social network&#xD;
      members, to improve usability and increase the likelihood of adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention arm, we chose 6 videos from the entire series to be delivered&#xD;
      sequentially for a total duration of 13 minutes. The first video sets the stage for the&#xD;
      intervention and introduces the viewer to an overview of LDKT. The next 5 videos address&#xD;
      common misconceptions about live kidney donation: Video 1: LDKT introduction, Video 2: Donor&#xD;
      eligibility, Video 3: Donor evaluation, Video 4: Kidney paired donation, Video 5: Donation&#xD;
      Costs, Video 6: Donor lifestyle. After completing the proscribed videos and an immediate-post&#xD;
      exposure survey, everyone then receives a link to access all 26 videos centralized on a&#xD;
      website where the videos were activated for sharing through various modalities, including&#xD;
      text, email, Facebook, and Twitter. The website can be accessed using this link from any&#xD;
      electronic device throughout the study. Website use will be prompted by automated messages&#xD;
      (email or SMS) that introduced videos that may interest users, provided the website link, and&#xD;
      encouraged video viewing and sharing. Messages will be personalized with their name and&#xD;
      provide researchers contact information. Prompts will be sent monthly for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants will receive the transplant program's 13-minute usual care video, a&#xD;
      nurse-narrated power-point-based video outlining recipient evaluation, surgery, recovery&#xD;
      processes and outcomes while highlighting the option of LDKT. This condition was active since&#xD;
      it intended to aid kidney transplant access. It was utilized to offer participants education&#xD;
      with perceived benefit and encourage further study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants routinely receive educational materials from non-study sources through usual&#xD;
      Transplant Center protocols including written materials, nurse communications, and the usual&#xD;
      care video shown on a clinic computer during transplant evaluation. Therefore control&#xD;
      participants viewed the usual care video twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the proscribed video education, all participants will be invited to fill out&#xD;
      serial surveys immediately (T1) and 1 month (T2), 6 months (T3), and 12-months (T4)&#xD;
      post-baseline. Participants will receive up to 6 reminders (5 automatic and 1 personalized)&#xD;
      to complete surveys followed by a postal version of the survey. At study conclusion,&#xD;
      intervention participants will be invited to an exit interview and controls will be offered&#xD;
      access to the intervention website. All participants will receive up to $125 for completing&#xD;
      study milestones (4 surveys and an exit interview).&#xD;

    <measure>LDKT Concerns Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post baseline, 1 month, 6 month, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Developed specifically for this study as a measure of patients' concerns about LDKT. Questions were drawn from existing measures in the literature. We created a 6-items scale that captured concerns about LDKT including donation costs, evaluation process, function with a single kidney, poor outcome, and surgical risk as well as one question about access to deceased-donor kidney transplantation. Items are rated on a scale of 1 to 4. Higher scores indicate greater concerns about live kidney donation.</description>
