    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a resilience school-based&#xD;
      intervention in adolescents and to understand whether the school training can improve levels&#xD;
      of resilience or psychological wellbeing, while reducing depressed mood.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Some studies with adolescents reported the impact of Coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health. In the literature, resilience was related with&#xD;
      positive mental health and was defined by some authors as a good mental health and a good&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning despite exposure to risk or adversity (Collishaw et al., 2016).&#xD;
      Additionally, resilience was also considered important to develop interventions to prevent or&#xD;
      treat mental disorders, particularly anxiety, depression, and stress. Schools have been&#xD;
      identified as one of the key settings for promoting resilience among children and young&#xD;
      populations in this time of COVID-19 pandemic, where social inequalities have become even&#xD;
      more evident and depressive symptoms have increased. The purpose of this trial is to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a resilience school-based intervention in adolescents and to understand&#xD;
      whether the school training can improve levels of resilience or increase psychological&#xD;
      wellbeing, while reducing depressed mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adolescents at risk between 12 and 15 years of age who receive a resilience&#xD;
      school-based intervention by school nurses, will obtain higher scores on scales of resilience&#xD;
      with respect to the control group, just after the intervention and 6-month post-intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). Schools that want to participate,&#xD;
      will sign an agreement to participate in the project Schools will be randomly allocated in&#xD;
      control and intervention groups by external researcher using a computer-generated random&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be carried out during the school period, by school nurses who are part&#xD;
      of the committee of experts and the research team. Students will follow a specific training&#xD;
      consisting of six 55-minute sessions, once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will start in winter 2022 and will finish in autumn 2022. Data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline before the intervention (T1), after 6 weeks post- intervention (T2) and&#xD;
      6 months after intervention as follow-up (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample was calculated using GRANMO&#xD;
      (https://www.imim.es/ofertadeserveis/software-public/granmo/) to be 70 students in each&#xD;
      group. A follow-up loss rate of 10% was estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention will be carried out using the&#xD;
      psychometric scale CYRM-32, which will allow us to determine changes in resilience.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible schools will be randomly allocated either to an intervention group or control. The clusters were school classrooms (grades 6, 7).The randomization procedure will be performed in two steps. First, the schools will be randomly allocated either to an intervention group or control by the external researcher using computer-generated random numbers; second, the external researcher will randomize the intervention group into the different school-levels.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Changes in level of resilience using the Brief Resilience scale.&#xD;
Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) The BRCS adapted to and validated in Spanish by Limonero et al. (2014) will be used. The BRCS is a self-reported measure composed of four items; for each item, participants use a 5-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;does not describe you at all&quot; and 5 = &quot;it describes you well&quot;).</description>

    <description>Changes in level of resilience using the scale Child Youth Resilience Measure -32 (CYRM-32)&#xD;
Child Youth Resilience Measure -32 (CYRM-32) The CYRM-32 includes 32 items is designed to assess resilience in children and young people (aged 12 to 23 years). It is a self-reported measure and for each question, participants use a 5-point Likert scale (1= not at all to 5= a lot (Llistosella et al., 2019).</description>

    <description>Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) The ERQ is a self-report questionnaire, adapted in Spain by Cabello et al. (2013). It will be used to assess two emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal (6 items) and expressive suppression (4 items). Participants will answer using a 7-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree).</description>

It was adapted from the &quot;Are you depressed?&quot; Screening for depression in the terminally ill (Chochinov et al., 1997) and it is evaluate through numeric scale of 0-10 (0-not depressed, 10-worst possible depression).</description>

    <description>The FRAK training was developed according to ecological framework, empirical evidence and contextual information. The contents, components, pedagogy, and technical elements of FRAK were established based on The Individual &amp; Environmental Resilience Model (IERM). Previous to the intervention, a systematic review and a meta-analysis on Resilience Interventions were performed.&#xD;
Students will follow a training consisting of six 55-minute sessions: (1) introducing resilience, (2) self-esteem, (3) emotional strategies regulation, (4) social skills, (5) solving problems (6) community resources, social and peers' support.</description>
