  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The non-psychotomimetic cannabis compound cannabidiol (CBD) has been found effective for&#xD;
      reducing alcohol drinking in mice. Moreover, other experimental studies have found that CBD&#xD;
      reduced alcohol-induced steatosis in the liver, and reduced alcohol-related injury in the&#xD;
      brain. Despite these promising results from animal data, no human study has been conducted&#xD;
      yet in alcohol use disorder (AUD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CBD has several potential therapeutic prospects in AUD. Preclinical studies now support the&#xD;
      potential of CBD for drinking reduction in AUD subjects. Moreover, other experimental studies&#xD;
      have found that CBD reverse the alcohol-induced steatosis process in the liver. These two&#xD;
      experimental effects need a translational confirmation in humans through an explanatory phase&#xD;
      2 study. In addition, CBD could also exert neuroprotective effects that reduce the&#xD;
      deleterious effects of alcohol on the brain. In both the liver and the brain, the&#xD;
      idiosyncratic anti-inflammatory effects of CBD could thus strengthen the overall harm&#xD;
      reduction allowed by drinking reduction in AUD ± ALD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBD deserves an exploratory study assessing whether the different therapeutic prospects in&#xD;
      AUD are warranted. Moreover, because CBD is extracted from cannabis, and even if it is a CB1&#xD;
      antagonist with no psychotomimetic effects and no reported potential for abuse, the first&#xD;
      pieces of evidence in AUD should confirm that CBD is safe in AUD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CARAMEL study is a phase-2 clinical trial on 76 subjects, which aims to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of CBD on reducing alcohol drinking, as well as the potential of CBD for restraining&#xD;
      alcohol-induced brain and liver injuries, and confirm the good safety profile of CBD.&#xD;
