  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Labour pain is the result of complex and subjective interactions of multiple physiologic and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors on a woman's interpretation of labour stimuli. It is an integral part of&#xD;
      the labour process, often associated with anxiety and being subjective, affects each woman's&#xD;
      experience of the birthing process in differing ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized clinical trial, involving primiparous women presenting to the&#xD;
      University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) for labour and delivery. Primiparous, term&#xD;
      women in labour will be eligible and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive music plus standard&#xD;
      of care during labour and standard care without music therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study will be to determine whether music therapy is an effective&#xD;
      adjunct or alternative to pharmacological therapies for pain and anxiety management in&#xD;
      labour. The secondary outcome would be to assess the effect of music on labour duration,&#xD;
      operative delivery rates, abnormal foetal heart rate patterns and APGAR scores. Approximately&#xD;
      260 primigravida women would be recruited and invited to participate in this randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial over an eight-month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Cambridge dictionary describes pain as a feeling of physical suffering caused by injury&#xD;
      and illnesses. This physical suffering is a subjective, natural, and inevitable process&#xD;
      associated with labour that is understandably, a most feared aspect of pregnancy for&#xD;
      expectant mothers. A woman's birthing experience is influenced by her social environment and&#xD;
      how she contextualizes the idea of pain as purposeful and productive versus threatening, the&#xD;
      latter of which could result in a more negative pain response. Historically prior to the 18th&#xD;
      century, natural methods were the only options for pain relief for women in labour. These&#xD;
      included various breathing techniques and positioning, massage techniques and herbal&#xD;
      mixtures. There is an increasing movement back to the historical practices of traditional and&#xD;
      non- pharmacological pain relief during labour, and research in these techniques is needed to&#xD;
      prove clinical effectiveness. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO)&#xD;
      recommendations: intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience- &quot; Most women desire&#xD;
      some form of pain relief during labour, and qualitative evidence indicates that relaxation&#xD;
      techniques can reduce labour discomfort, relieve pain and enhance the maternal birth&#xD;
      experience.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most used pharmacological agents during labour is meperidine hydrochloride&#xD;
      (Pethidine®) as it is readily available with a higher level of administrator comfort than&#xD;
      other agents. Overuse of pharmacological interventions can lead to increased maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal morbidity, reduced local supply of pharmacological agents and even financial strain&#xD;
      on low resource institutions. Patients with a low pain threshold in early labour due to&#xD;
      anxiety and fear may also request analgesia in the latent phase which can result in the&#xD;
      inability to receive repeated doses early in the active phase due to dosing frequency&#xD;
      guidelines. This can then result in maternal distress and poor labour outcomes when the&#xD;
      additive effect of labour progression, results in more severe pain. Meperidine hydrochloride&#xD;
      has been shown to offer variable pain control with a more sedation than analgesic effect,&#xD;
      hence adjunctive therapy with music may prove beneficial for its potential additive analgesic&#xD;
      effect. Meperidine hydrochloride's use has also been found to be associated with increased&#xD;
      rate of augmentation in labour, increased operative deliveries, and adverse maternal effects&#xD;
      such as nausea, vomiting and dizziness and also a linkage to neonatal respiratory depression&#xD;
      &amp; APGAR scores &lt; 7 and acidosis [umbilical artery potential of Hydrogen (pH) &lt;7.12] have been&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The United Nation (UN) Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health seeks&#xD;
      to ensure that not only do women survive childbirth complications if they arise, but also&#xD;
      that they thrive and reach their full potential for health and life. To facilitate safe&#xD;
      labour and childbirth, attention must be given to the management of the psychological and&#xD;
      emotional needs of women. Anxiety of the labour process is frequently seen in mothers&#xD;
      presenting for delivery. This is shown to be more common in primiparous women especially if&#xD;
      they have not received antenatal counselling on what to expect in labour(9). Studies have&#xD;
      shown that anxiety can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, releasing excessive stress&#xD;
      hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline contributing to dysfunctional uterine contractility&#xD;
      and labour dystocia. Music therapy has been shown to be an effective, inexpensive, safe and&#xD;
      non-invasive intervention for patients undergoing many non-obstetric procedures such as&#xD;
      decreased pain and anxiety during bone marrow biopsy and aspiration and nasal bone fracture&#xD;
      reduction as well as decreased anxiety and propofol (Diprivan®) consumption during&#xD;
      colonoscopy/endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With more women exploring the option of physiological birthing techniques (&quot;Natural Birthing&#xD;
      Techniques&quot;), an approach to labour and birth that normalizes the strength and physiology of&#xD;
      the woman and foetus and refrains from external intervention unless there is potential&#xD;
      compromise to mother or foetus, music therapy may offer a natural alternative to&#xD;
      pharmacological approaches to pain relief that are the standard of care in may labour and&#xD;
      delivery suites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music can have a direct impact on the perception of pain by activating the gate-control&#xD;
      theory of pain which attacks both cognitive and physiological factors associated with pain.&#xD;
      The gate theory works on the idea that there is a gateway in the dorsal horn of the spinal&#xD;
      cord that manages the perception of pain via opening and closing of this gate. Pain sensation&#xD;
      is carried via small neural fibres that pass this gate in route to the brain for&#xD;
      interpretation. Music can close this gateway by stimulating a large number of neurological&#xD;
      fibres some of which would have been activated for a pain response if available, and hence no&#xD;
      transmission of pain sensation in response to stimulation. Music can also serve as a&#xD;
      distraction mechanism improving general mood and hence decreasing negative pain perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music during labour is perceived by the right hemisphere of the brain and can result in the&#xD;
      release of endorphins which provide analgesia by binding to opioid receptors at pre and post&#xD;
      synaptic nerve terminals. This binding results in the inhibition of substance P an important&#xD;
      protein involved in the transmission of pain. Studies show that decreased levels of serum&#xD;
      cortisol and the release of neural system of reward hormones such as dopamine is linked to&#xD;
      the anxiety reducing effect of music therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study performed by Buglione et al., pain level during active phase of labour was 8.8 ±&#xD;
      0.9 in music group and, 9.8 ± 0.3 in control group [Mean Difference (MD) - 1.00 point, 95%,&#xD;
      Chloride (Cl) - 1.48 to - 0.52; P &lt;0.01]. Music during labour and delivery was also&#xD;
      associated with decreased pain 1h postpartum as well as decreased anxiety levels during the&#xD;
      active phase, second stage and 1hour postpartum. This study was however studied in a small&#xD;
      population of 30 Italian women; hence generalizability of findings is uncertain. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis and systematic review of studies published between 2003 and June 2018 showed&#xD;
      significant differences in Visual Analog pain scale (VAS) scores in favour of music therapy&#xD;
      in the intensity of latent phase of labour pain (MD: -0.73; 95% Cl -0.99, -0.48); in the&#xD;
      active phase (MD: -0.68; 95% Cl -0.92, -0.44) in its entirety or during the first phase (MD:&#xD;
      -1.71; 95% Cl -2.65, -0.77) and second hour postintervention (MD: -2.90; 95% Cl -3.79,&#xD;
      -2.01). In terms of anxiety, Santiváñez-Acosta et al evaluated three studies which revealed&#xD;
      significant differences in anxiety level in the latent phase (MD: -0.74; 95% Cl -1.00, -0.48)&#xD;
      and active phase of labour (MD: -0.76; 95% Cl -0.88, -0.64).&#xD;
