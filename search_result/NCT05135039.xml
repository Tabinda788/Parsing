  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high prevalence of prediabetes in HIV patients is also an outpost event for the further&#xD;
      development of diabetes and cardiovascular events, as well as for the prolonged survival of&#xD;
      HIV patients with metabolic problems and their complications. Based on the well-established&#xD;
      experience in the field of traditional diabetes with prediabetes, the combination of SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors can target the pathophysiological mechanisms of HIV-induced metabolic disorders,&#xD;
      and the results of a small pilot study of one of the representative drugs, cabergoline, in&#xD;
      HIV-combined diabetic patients suggest its efficacy and safety in the treatment of&#xD;
      HIV-combined diabetic patients. Combined with the advantages of the concentrated disease&#xD;
      resources of HIV patients in the investigator's unit, this study is intended to use a&#xD;
      single-center randomized controlled clinical trial design, giving the experimental group drug&#xD;
      combined with lifestyle intervention and the control group lifestyle combined with placebo&#xD;
      intervention, to verify whether the combination of cabergoline and lifestyle intervention can&#xD;
      safely and significantly change the clinical outcome of glucose metabolism, as well as the&#xD;
      effect on body weight and pancreatic islet function of patients The study provides top&#xD;
      clinical evidence for the treatment of these patients and suggests a new set of interventions&#xD;
      for patients with HIV combined with prediabetes. No similar studies have been found to be&#xD;
      innovative in the literature search, and the implementation of this study will be of great&#xD;
      clinical value.&#xD;
