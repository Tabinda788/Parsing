  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitrectomy to remove an epiretinal membrane (ERM) is one of the most common procedures&#xD;
      performed by retinal surgeons. Patients who present with significant macular changes on&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) but relatively good vision are often advised to defer&#xD;
      surgery until vision declines to 20/40 or worse. However, it is unknown if delaying surgery,&#xD;
      which allows the foveal architecture to remain compromised and potentially to deteriorate,&#xD;
      results in worse visual acuity outcomes than if surgery is performed earlier. In addition,&#xD;
      there is a need to better understand predictors of outcomes when surgery is performed and&#xD;
      predictors of progression when surgery is deferred. Finally, one of the most common&#xD;
      presenting symptoms from an ERM is distortion or metamorphopsia. There are several objective&#xD;
      measures of metamorphopsia but none have ever been employed to evaluate ERMs in a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) and their usefulness is unknown. The purposes of this study are to&#xD;
      better understand the optimal timing of surgery to produce the best visual result, to better&#xD;
      understand predictors of outcomes in those who undergo surgery and predictors of progression&#xD;
      in those whose are observed, and to better characterize and evaluate the usefulness of a&#xD;
      variety of measures of metamorphopsia.&#xD;

    <description>Visual acuity is measured as a continuous integer letter score from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating better visual acuity. A letter score of 85 is approximately 20/20 and a letter score of 70 is approximately 20/40, the legal unrestricted driving limit in most states. A 5-letter change for an individual is approximately equal to a 1-line change on a vision chart.</description>

    <description>Vitrectomy may be performed only if at least one of the following criteria is met:&#xD;
Decrease in visual acuity ≥10 letters from baseline at a single visit presumed to be from ERM&#xD;
Decrease in visual acuity ≥5 letters from baseline at two consecutive visits presumed to be from ERM&#xD;
i. Visits must be at least one month apart c. Participant actively requests surgery due to worsening symptoms d. Complication requires prompt surgical intervention (e.g., macular hole, retinal detachment, non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage)</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual acuity 20/25 to 20/40&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Epiretinal membrane (ERM) must be thought to be the primary cause of vision loss&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ERM meeting the following criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptoms of visual loss and/or distortion (and in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  investigator, the ERM is contributing to the participant's symptoms); either new&#xD;
                  or worsening in the past 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Epiretinal membrane involving or altering the central 3 mm of the macula on&#xD;
                  optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Distortion of the foveal center by ERM on OCT&#xD;

             detachment, inflammatory disease, or associations other than vitreous syneresis,&#xD;
             retinal break, or posterior vitreous detachment&#xD;
