      The goal of this study is to test whether a new device developed at UAB can decrease the&#xD;
      error in calculating blood flow of a brain tumor, leading to better prognosis. UAB&#xD;
      radiological research team has been studying a cutting-edge imaging technique named dynamic&#xD;
      contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, or DCE-MRI, over 10 years. This technique has&#xD;
      been globally used to calculate blood flow of various tissues including tumors. Blood flow&#xD;
      often serves as a critical indicator showing a disease status. For example, a brain tumor has&#xD;
      typically high blood flow, so the magnitude of blood flow can be used as an indicator to&#xD;
      identify the presence and aggressiveness of a brain tumor. In addition, an effective therapy&#xD;
      can result in the alteration of the blood flow in a brain tumor. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      may be able to determine whether the undergoing therapy is effective or not by measuring the&#xD;
      blood flow in the brain tumor, and decide whether they need to continue the therapy or try a&#xD;
      different one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, unfortunately, the measurement of blood flow using DCE-MRI is often inaccurate. MRI&#xD;
      scanners may use different hardware and software thus the measurement may be different across&#xD;
      scanners. The measurement may also be different over time due to hardware instability.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose to use an artificial tissue, named &quot;phantom&quot;, together&#xD;
      with a patient. The phantom has a constant blood flow thus it can serve as a standard.&#xD;
      Errors, if it occurs, will affect the images of both the patient and the phantom. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators will be able to correct the errors in the patient image using the phantom&#xD;
      image. UAB radiological research team invented a new device for this purpose named&#xD;
      point-of-care portable perfusion phantom, or shortly P4. The team recently demonstrated the&#xD;
      utility of the P4 phantom for accurate measurement of blood flow in pancreatic cancer and&#xD;
      prostate cancer. In this study, they will test whether the P4 phantom will improve the&#xD;
      measurement accuracy in brain cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant type of brain tumor in adults. Surgical&#xD;
      tumor resection followed by chemoradiation therapy is the standard of care for patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma, but its prognosis is still fairly dismal (median survival time = 15 months).&#xD;
      One major concern that prevents effective treatment management is the difficulty of&#xD;
      differentiating between pseudo-progression and true-progression. Pseudo-progression occurs in&#xD;
      about 20-30% of glioblastoma patients typically within 3 months after chemoradiation therapy&#xD;
      has been completed. Pseudo-progression is a local inflammatory reaction caused by irradiation&#xD;
      and enhanced by concurrent chemotherapy, which leads to a transient increase of blood brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB) permeability. The BBB, however, is also disrupted by new cancer occurrence.&#xD;
      Therefore, both pseudo- and true-progressions appear with an increased contrast enhancement&#xD;
      in MRI, and there are currently no established techniques to differentiate between them.&#xD;
      Pseudo-progression is typically known to be associated with better clinical outcomes, so&#xD;
      pseudo-progression mistaken for true-progression results in the discontinuation of an&#xD;
      effective therapy, while true-progression mistaken for pseudo-progression leads to the&#xD;
      continuation of an ineffective therapy that may induce adverse side effects. DCE-MRI has&#xD;
      potential to differentiate between pseudo- and true-progressions of glioblastoma. The&#xD;
      enhancing lesions of pseudo-progression are due to inflammation, whereas those of&#xD;
      true-progression are caused by cancer growing. Thus, true-progression typically presents&#xD;
      higher perfusion than pseudo-progression does. DCE-MRI can quantitatively assess the tissue&#xD;
      perfusion by monitoring the dynamic change of MRI contrast agent concentration. Several&#xD;
      investigators have demonstrated the potential of quantitative DCE-MRI to differentiate&#xD;
      between pseudo- and true-progressions. However, the variability in quantitative DCE-MRI&#xD;
      measurement across different MRI scanners remains a major concern, as it hinders data&#xD;
      comparison among institutes to retrieve a reliable threshold for accurate prognosis and&#xD;
      subsequent treatment optimization. A point-of-care perfusion phantom may allow high&#xD;
      reproducibility and accurate comparison of quantitative DCE-MRI data across MRI platforms.&#xD;
      The UAB radiological research team recently developed the P4 phantom, which is small enough&#xD;
      to be imaged concurrently with a patient for real-time quality assurance, but large enough&#xD;
      not to suffer from the partial volume effect. The P4 phantom creates constant contrast&#xD;
      enhancement curves with very robust repeatability, and thus the contrast agent concentration&#xD;
      time-course in a tumor, which is a major source of error in quantitating DCE-MRI parameters,&#xD;
      can be accurately calculated in reference to the values observed in the phantom. In our&#xD;
      previous study, the variability in quantitating the volume transfer constant of various human&#xD;
      tissues across two different MRI scanners was reduced fivefold after P4-based error&#xD;
      correction. The investigators hypothesize that the variability in quantitative DCE-MRI&#xD;
      measurement of glioblastoma across different scanners will be significantly reduced when the&#xD;
      P4 is used for error correction, leading to better differentiation between pseudo- and&#xD;
      true-progressions. The goal of this study is to test this hypothesis.&#xD;

    <description>The goal is to measure the reproducibility of blood perfusion measurement in the glioblastoma using the two consecutive DCE-MRI scans with and without P4-based error correction.&#xD;
The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter within the ROI will be averaged at each scan after P4-based error correction, and the mean values of two scans will be compared to calculate the reproducibility coefficient (%RDC) using the equation, %RDC=2.77wCV, where wCV is the within-subject coefficient of variation. The %RDC before P4-based error correction will also be calculated for comparison. Data reproducibility will be assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) as well. ICC = σ 2b / (σ 2b+ σ 2w), where σb is between-subject standard deviation and σw is within-subject standard deviation.</description>

    <description>The PK parameter (e.g., Ktrans) in the tumor with pseudoprogression will be statistically compared with that with true-progression before and after P4-based error correction to determine whether the differentiation between the pseudo- and true-progressions of glioblastoma can be improved using qDCE-MRI after P4-based error correction. Each tumor will be classified into pseudo- or true-progression based on RANO criteria.</description>
