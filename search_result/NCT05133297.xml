    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count-High-Sensitivity C-reactive Protein (DAS28-hsCRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Activity Score (DAS) based on a 28 joint count hsCRP consisted of composite numerical score of following variables: tender joint count (TJC28), swollen joint count (SJC28), hsCRP (mg/mL), and participant's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28-hsCRP was calculated using following formula: DAS28-hsCRP equals to (=) 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) plus (+) 0.28*sqrt (SJC28) + 0.36*natural log(hsCRP+1) + 0.014*participant's global assessment of disease activity + 0.96. Scores ranged 0-9.4, where lower scores indicated less disease activity. Change = value at observation minus value at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>CDAI is calculated as the sum of tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity as assessed by Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) subscore, and Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in cm). 28 joints are examined. The range for the CDAI is 0 - 76 with a negative change in CDAI score indicating an improvement in disease activity and a positive change in score indicating a worsening of disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI score was an evaluation of the functional status for a participant. The 20-question instrument assessed the degree of difficulty a person had in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0, indicated no difficulty, to 3, indicated inability to perform a task in that area. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range: 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Participant's Assessment of Pain Based on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were asked to assess their level of pain by marking a vertical tick on a 100 mm horizontal VAS scale. The scale ranged from 0-100 mm, where 0 indicated no pain and 100 indicated worst possible pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants answered: &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?&quot; Participants responded by using a 0 - 100 mm Visual Analog Scale where 0 = very well and 100 = very poorly. Change = score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity was measured on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with 0 mm = no disease activity; very good and 100 mm = worst disease activity; very poor. Change = score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>
