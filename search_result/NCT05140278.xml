  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study contains 3 parts: (1) a comparison of 1-step parenteral&#xD;
      artesunate (AS) versus conventional 2-step parenteral artesunate in patients with severe&#xD;
      malaria to assess the feasibility of administration, parasite and fever clearance times in&#xD;
      two countries, (2) a quantification of convenience and costs of the new 1-step artesunate&#xD;
      parenteral formulation versus the conventional formulation in a randomised study, (3) A cost&#xD;
      analysis of 1-step parenteral artesunate using data from Part 1 &amp; Part 2. This will assess&#xD;
      health facility-level costs, and also health system costs to encompass all costs of a&#xD;
      potential change from conventional to 1-step artesunate, including re-training, materials,&#xD;
      and drug replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional formulation of injectable artesunate requires a 2-step reconstitution and&#xD;
      dilution of the artesunate hemisuccinate powder. A new formulation of injectable artesunate&#xD;
      has been developed by Fosun Pharma requiring a simpler 1-step reconstitution. Bioequivalence&#xD;
      of the new formulation to the conventional formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For part 1, a total number of participants of this study would be 200 participants, estimated&#xD;
      100 per site will be recruited. For part 2, a total number of 40 semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      with study staff, health staff, policy makers, and stake holders; and survey/questionnaires&#xD;
      with 150 health staff.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of 1-step parenteral artesunate vs. conventional 2-step parenteral artesunate in&#xD;
      patients with severe malaria to assess the feasibility of administration, parasite and fever&#xD;
      clearance times of 1-step parenteral artesunate to conventional artesunate in 2 countries.&#xD;
      Patients with severe malaria will be enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment with&#xD;
      conventional injectable artesunate or 1-step injectable artesunate. A physical examination&#xD;
      will be performed daily and every six hours on indication. Vital signs rec-orded hourly for&#xD;
      unstable patients, then 6 hourly for stabilised patients, and at each follow-up visit. A&#xD;
      symptom questionnaire will be taken daily to help identify adverse events. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to come back for a follow-up visit at day 7, 14, 21 and 28. Patients will not be&#xD;
      followed up longer. In case of unresolved important sequelae at day 28, the patient will be&#xD;
      followed and treated longer in order to provide the appropriate clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Time and Motion study will record the time to prepare the artesunate solution for injection&#xD;
      and administer treatment, number of actions performed to prepare treatment, and consumables&#xD;
      used. Clinical, parasitological, and laboratory assessments will be recorded while patients&#xD;
      are admitted in hospital and then weekly up to day 28 to assess recovery and determine final&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed method social science study that entails semi-structure interviews and survey with&#xD;
      study staff (involved in part 1), health workers (who treat severe malaria) and policymakers&#xD;
      and stakeholders (who are involved in devising national malaria policy and its&#xD;
      implementation), to assess the acceptability, feasibility, pros and cons, costs, and&#xD;
      logistics and training implications of 1-step artesunate vs conventional artesunate. For both&#xD;
      sites, semi-structure interviews will be conducted with minimum of a total of 40 respondents&#xD;
      consisting of study staff, health staff and policy makers and stakeholders. The ultimate&#xD;
      sample for semi-structure interviews will be dependent on the data saturation. For&#xD;
      survey/questionnaire, a maximum number of relevant participants (study staff and health care&#xD;
      staff) will be attempted to be recruited from two sites. A minimum of 150 study staff and&#xD;
      health care staff will be recruited in the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost analysis of 1-step parenteral artesunate using data from Part 1 &amp; Part 2. This will&#xD;
      assess health facility-level costs, and also health system costs to encompass all costs of a&#xD;
      potential change from conventional to 1-step artesunate, including re-training, materials,&#xD;
      drug replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to time measurement, the observer will also record the resources used for the&#xD;
      administration of artesunate. This will include the vials themselves, as well as other&#xD;
      consumables required for the administration (syringes, needles, catheters, etc.).&#xD;
