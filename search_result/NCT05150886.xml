      BACKGROUND: ROX index (SpO2 / FiO2) / respiratory rate, which is the ratio of peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) and inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) divided by respiratory rate, to&#xD;
      predict failure of HFNO therapy and intubation in patients with a rapid, easy-to-use, rapidly&#xD;
      administered pneumonia. index used not to delay. This is a rating. HFNO reduces the need for&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pneumonia.&#xD;
      It has been suggested that HFNO may reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      compared to conventional oxygen therapy. Recently, experience has been reported that HFNO&#xD;
      therapy also reduces the need for endotracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia. However, there are studies showing that insisting on HFNO and delaying intubation&#xD;
      increase mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure. In this study; We aimed to investigate the validity of the ROX index in&#xD;
      predicting HFNO failure in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL - METHOD: The population of the research consists of patients who will be&#xD;
      hospitalized in the COVID-19 intensive care unit of Health Sciences University Ankara Atatürk&#xD;
      Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Training and Research Hospital for 3 months. According to&#xD;
      a study conducted in Italy, 87% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care go to&#xD;
      intubation (6). Adult patients (≥18 years old) with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia, positive PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, and HFNO when admitted to the intensive care&#xD;
      unit will be included in this study. Patients under the age of 18 who received non-invasive&#xD;
      or invasive mechanical ventilation therapy before HFNO will not be included in the study.&#xD;
      Patients with chronic lung disease will be excluded from the study. RT-PCR tests will be&#xD;
      performed with serial samples for detection of viral RNA. Demographic, clinical, treatment&#xD;
      and laboratory data of the patients will be recorded. ROX score, APACHE 2 scores, Pneumonia&#xD;
      Severity Index (PSI) score, CURB-65 and SOFA score will be calculated and recorded. In&#xD;
      addition, the day of hospitalization in the intensive care unit, intensive care and hospital&#xD;
      mortality, intubation time, invasive mechanical ventilation day, time of exit from the&#xD;
      intensive care unit and discharge from the hospital will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORGANİZATİON AND ANALYSİS OF RESEARCH DATA The sample number of the study was calculated with&#xD;
      the OpenEpi online computer program. The number of samples calculated with α= 0.05, d=5 and&#xD;
      87% frequency in the 95% confidence interval is 122. SPSS 23.0 statistical package program&#xD;
      will be used for statistical analysis of research data. As a statistical analysis, in the&#xD;
      descriptive findings section, categorical variables will be presented as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages, and continuous variables will be presented as mean±standard deviation (min-max)&#xD;
      for data showing normal distribution and median (IQR; 25-75). For categorical variables for&#xD;
      non-normally distributed data, whether there is a frequency difference between groups will be&#xD;
      compared using appropriate chi-square tests. Continuous variables will be compared with the&#xD;
      normal distribution using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. ROC analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to determine whether the ROX index has a good cut-off value in making the&#xD;
      intubation decision of COVID-19 patients. Statistical significance level will be accepted as&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
