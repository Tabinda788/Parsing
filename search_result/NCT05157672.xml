  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a well-characterized, commercially available&#xD;
      cinnamon dietary supplement as a precipitant of pharmacokinetic interactions with CYP2A6&#xD;
      substrates in healthy volunteers. Nicotine gum will be used as the CYP2A6 probe drug (i.e.,&#xD;
      positive control) and letrozole as a high-impact object drug. Results will be used to inform&#xD;
      future research on the potential use of cinnamon as a smoking cessation agent, as well as the&#xD;
      clinical impact on pharmacotherapeutic regimens involving letrozole in cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cinnamon is used worldwide as both an additive and a botanical dietary supplement, the latter&#xD;
      of which ranked within the 30 top-selling herbal supplements in 2020. Cinnamon is added to a&#xD;
      variety of products, ranging from foods (e.g., breakfast cereals, baked goods) to fragrances&#xD;
      and essential oils, to improve taste or smell. As a dietary supplement, cinnamon is commonly&#xD;
      used to lower blood sugar and reduce inflammation. Cinnamon contains the abundant component,&#xD;
      cinnamaldehyde (CA), a phenylpropanoid that emanates the flavor and scent of cinnamon.&#xD;
      Research by Harrelson and colleagues has shown CA to inhibit the drug metabolizing enzyme&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6 in a time-dependent manner. That is, CYP2A6 metabolizes CA to a&#xD;
      reactive intermediate that destroys the enzyme. Such substrates are also referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;suicide substrates&quot;. This type of enzyme inhibition is similar to that of grapefruit juice,&#xD;
      which contains furanocoumarins that are time-dependent inhibitors of CYP3A in the intestine,&#xD;
      leading to numerous potential adverse interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Unlike&#xD;
      competitive inhibitors, time-dependent inhibitors inactivate the enzyme permanently,&#xD;
      requiring de novo synthesis of the enzyme. As such, drug interactions with time-dependent&#xD;
      inhibitors can last for several days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative to CYP3A, the list of clinically relevant CYP2A6 substrates is very short. However,&#xD;
      two critical substrates include nicotine and the anticancer agent letrozole. Using an in&#xD;
      vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation approach, CA was predicted to increase the area under the&#xD;
      plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of both substrates by 4- to 5-fold exceeding the&#xD;
      FDA recommended cutoff (1.25) These compelling observations prompted this clinical study.&#xD;
