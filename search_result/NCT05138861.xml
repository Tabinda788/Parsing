      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study. A single drop of the ophthalmic&#xD;
      solution will be instilled in each eye on the morning of Day 1 and then twice a day (in the&#xD;
      morning and in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart) starting on Day 2 for 40&#xD;
      consecutive days (Days 2 to 41). Thereafter, a single drop of the ophthalmic solution will be&#xD;
      instilled in each eye on the morning of Day 42, for a total of 82 consecutive doses&#xD;
      administered in each eye. The doses of Days 1, 2 (morning), 41 (evening), and 42 will be&#xD;
      self-administered under supervision of the site staff at the clinical site. All remaining&#xD;
      doses will be self-administered at home. Throughout the study, PK blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected and safety assessments will be performed.&#xD;
