  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a rare, autoimmune, cholestatic liver disease. No data&#xD;
      about the disease epidemiology exist in Italy. Therefore this study aims to develop a&#xD;
      national PBC patient database linked to a biological sample storage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an immune-mediated liver disease characterized by&#xD;
      chronic inflammation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, causing progressive ductopenia,&#xD;
      cholestasis, and if not effectively treated, leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver&#xD;
      failure. Nowadays almost all patients with PBC are diagnosed at an early disease stage and&#xD;
      receive treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) which is currently the only drug approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with PBC. However, approximately 20% to 30% (up to &gt;50% in&#xD;
      patients presenting under the age of 40 years) still does not have a benefit from UDCA and&#xD;
      has a reduced prognosis as compared to healthy individuals. Major steps forwards in the field&#xD;
      of PBC have been done in the last decade, however there are still significant areas of unmet&#xD;
      clinical need in PBC: the lack of knowledge on etiopathogenesis; a poor understanding of&#xD;
      disease sub-phenotypes; the lack of biomarkers of disease progression that allow risk&#xD;
      stratification needed in clinical management and trials design, among the others. In the&#xD;
      current evolving research landscape with the availability of the -omics technologies&#xD;
      generating libraries of genome-wide data, metabolomics and proteomics data, among the others,&#xD;
      the prospects of discovering the gene and molecular underpinnings of PBC are more promising&#xD;
      than ever. Scientists envision an era of &quot;personalized medicine&quot; when more and more people&#xD;
      will obtain their own genetic and metabolic maps, enabling them to identify their status as&#xD;
      carriers of specific risk profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these premises, the current project aims to build up a research, nation-wide&#xD;
      infrastructure (around 60 Italian participating centres will be involved) to study the&#xD;
      biology of PBC and, in particular, to explore why a significant group of, typically young&#xD;
      patients fail primary therapy with UDCA, placing them at risk of developing progressive&#xD;
      disease and needing liver transplantation (LT). The investigators will recruit patients and&#xD;
      organise the collection of important clinical information and laboratory investigation,&#xD;
      together with biological samples. Data will be collected in the form of electronic Case&#xD;
      Report Forms (REDCap cloud) that will be completed by clinicians at baseline and thereafter&#xD;
      on an annual basis. The clinical information will allow us to identify patients' clinical&#xD;
      profiles. The biological samples will allow to understand key aspects of people's make up,&#xD;
      including patient genes and the way their immune system works, and the differences in make up&#xD;
      between people with different clinical phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research infrastructure would represent an invaluable resource for successful&#xD;
      translational research in this field. Specifically, it would serve investigators conducting&#xD;
      research; clinicians treating patients; epidemiologists gathering demographic data; and the&#xD;
      drug and device industry seeking new markets. It also can represent a necessary&#xD;
      infrastructure for the implementation of the European Reference Networks (ERN) for rare&#xD;
      diseases, main pillars of the current EU policy framework on National Plans for research and&#xD;
      development. The Italian PBC database would also be crucial for drug development,&#xD;
      specifically to assess the feasibility of clinical trials, to facilitate the planning of&#xD;
      appropriate clinical trials, to support the enrolment of patients and to assess the impact of&#xD;
      new interventions.&#xD;
