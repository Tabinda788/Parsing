    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center exploratory clinical trial. It is estimated that 9-24 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled. The &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design is adopted. The main purpose is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of RD133 in the treatment of subjects with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      MSLN-positive solid tumors and explore the Recommend phase II dose of RD133 in the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with relapsed/refractory MSLN-positive solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture RD133 chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      (CAR) modified T cells. Bridging therapy is allowed between PBMC collection and&#xD;
      lymphodepletion. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was performed for&#xD;
      three consecutive days. After 1-day rest, subjects will receive a single dose infusion of&#xD;
      RD133 at 1.0, 3.0, or 6.0x 10^6 CAR+ T cells/Kg. Subjects will be followed in the study for a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 years after RD133 infusion. Long-term follow-up for lentiviral vector safety&#xD;
      will be followed for up to 15 years after RD133 infusion.&#xD;

    <description>The enhanced MSLN-CAR-T cell design of this study is obtained by co-infecting T cells with two lentiviral vectors. One lentiviral vector expresses CD19-CAR and tEGFR molecular safety switch, and the other lentiviral vector expresses MSLN- CAR and dnTGFβRII receptors. dnTGFβRII receptor without intracellular signal is used to resist the inhibition of T cell function by the immune microenvironment of tumor tissue. In addition, for the safety of CAR-T cell application in vivo, tEGFR is used in the CAR design as a molecular safety switch for CAR-T cells.</description>
