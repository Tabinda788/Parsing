  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the effectiveness of recovery oriented cognitive therapy (CT-R) for&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. To evaluate CT-R, we are conducting a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with patients from community mental health centers. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to the CT-R condition, in which they will receive approximately 9 months&#xD;
      of CT-R as an adjunctive treatment to their current medical treatment, or to the continued&#xD;
      usual care control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure (positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms) as&#xD;
      well as secondary measures (quality of life, self-esteem, social anhedonia, recovery,&#xD;
      dysfunctional attitudes, resilience, internalized stigma, and hopelessness) will be measured&#xD;
      at baseline, 4-5 months after the first therapy appointment, approximately 9 months after the&#xD;
      first therapy appointment, and approximately 15 months after the baseline appointment.&#xD;

      Background/Purpose: Despite effective medical treatment, many patients with psychotic&#xD;
      illnesses experience poor long-term functional outcomes possibly due to certain psychosocial&#xD;
      factors that can interfere with recovery. CT-R was developed to address these factors by&#xD;
      leading the individual to substantive progress by addressing any obstacles and promoting a&#xD;
      cognitive shift in their beliefs in their own personal and social efficacy. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness and mechanisms of CT-R as an adjunctive treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Participants will include individuals currently receiving pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Therapist participants who have&#xD;
      preliminary training in CT-R will be recruited as well to deliver the treatment. Therapists&#xD;
      will first complete a training phase consisting of a workshop and approximately 3 months of&#xD;
      group supervision while providing CT-R to 1 training case each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The CT-R that will be implemented in the present study will focus on&#xD;
      strengthening aspirations and focusing on activities that can bring about one's desired life.&#xD;
      In CT-R, clinicians use techniques to engage the patient in the adaptive mode, which includes&#xD;
      cognitions, affects, motivation, and behaviors that are activated when the individual is&#xD;
      engaged in personally meaningful activities.&#xD;

    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months after the baseline appointment</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Consists of 33 items each rated on a scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Scale (QLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months after the baseline appointment</time_frame>
    <description>Measures quality in life of individuals living with schizophrenia and functioning. Total scores range from 0-126. Lower scores indicate lower quality of life and functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Social Anhedonia Scale (RSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months after the baseline appointment</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire assessing attitudes and preferences related to spending time with other people. Total score ranges from 0 to 20. Higher scores indicate a preference to spend time alone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months after the baseline appointment</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring the extent of positive and negative beliefs about the future. Total score ranges from 0 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher levels of hopelessness.</description>

    <measure>Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months after the baseline appointment</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure assessing levels of dysfunctional attitudes. It consists of 7 subscales for a total of 40 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (totally agree) to 7 (totally disagree).</description>

    <description>Therapists implement CT-R in weekly sessions for approximately 9 months while supported by a clinical supervisor. Therapists will have completed a supervised CT-R training case prior to the initiation of the randomized controlled trial. CT-R will focus on strengthening aspirations and focusing on activities that can bring about one's desired life. The therapist will use techniques to engage the patient in the adaptive mode, which involves activating cognitions, affects, motivation, and behaviors by engaging the individual in personally meaningful activities.</description>
