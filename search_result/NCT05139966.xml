      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vivo the efficacy of fluoride-containing dentifrice incorporated in&#xD;
      a controlled-release system (F-CSL, patent pending) in the remineralization of white spot&#xD;
      lesions of caries in caries-active individuals. METHODS: A double-blind randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the bioavailability of intraoral fluoride in biomarkers of exposure&#xD;
      (biofilm and saliva) after the use of experimental toothpaste in the control of dental&#xD;
      caries. The study will last three months. The participants of the study will be divided into&#xD;
      three groups according to the dentifrice used. The sample will be selected randomly and&#xD;
      composed of children and adolescents who seek the service of cariology of the UFPB. There&#xD;
      will be participants of both sexes, preferably of the metropolitan region of João Pessoa in&#xD;
      order to guarantee the low fluorine exposure by the water of supply. Intrabucal photographs&#xD;
      will be obtained. Samples of saliva will be collected after 3 hours of the last meal. The&#xD;
      benefits will be achieved by obtaining the reduction of the white spot area (mm2) plus the&#xD;
      fact that all the children will be examined and will receive information on the treatment&#xD;
      needs and forwading for the same.&#xD;

      Study Design:A randomized, triple-blind crossover clinical trial study was performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the bioavailability of intraoral fluoride in biomarkers of exposure (biofilm and&#xD;
      saliva) after the use of mouthwash with experimental fluoride for one week, with wash-out&#xD;
      periods between them. The biofilm was collected 1 hour (h) and 12h after toothbrushing and&#xD;
      the use of mouthwash, and saliva was collected 1h (T1 - T60 min) and 12h. The data was&#xD;
      obtained by potentiometry (ion selective electrode) for fluoride in these samples. The pilot&#xD;
      test was performed with three participants before the study begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental mouthwashes:The participants were allocated randomly to use the following&#xD;
      experimental mouthwashes: P - placebo (without F); 100% sodium fluoride (NaF) (225 ppm) -&#xD;
      positive control; 50% nanoencapsulated fluoride (225 ppm, 50% free NaF + 50% nanoF); and 100%&#xD;
      nanoF (225 ppm) (Savoy SA - São Paulo, Brazil). All mouthwashes were packed in similar&#xD;
      containers and had the same color and flavor. They were coded by an independent investigator&#xD;
      not involved in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple randomization was performed taking into account a cross design. The unit of&#xD;
      randomization was &quot;mouthwash&quot;, so all mouthwashes had the same chance of being selected. The&#xD;
      design of the study was created for each participant and for each new one another draw was&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical stage:First, the participants were submitted to dental prophylaxis and scraping to&#xD;
      remove all biofilm and dental calculus. They used a placebo mouthwash for 7 days. Then, the&#xD;
      Whitford protocol was followed [17]. Briefly, the subjects were instructed to rinse 10 ml of&#xD;
      the mouthwash 2 times / day (morning and evening) for 1 min after toothbrushing (a non-F&#xD;
      dentifrice was used throughout the study). On the seventh day, the subjects were instructed&#xD;
      to brush only the occlusal surfaces, rinse the mouthwash 2 times and do not use dental floss,&#xD;
      to allow biofilm accumulation. After going to bed, they abstained from eating or drinking&#xD;
      anything except water, did not brush their teeth or use the mouthwash. The next morning,&#xD;
      after 12 hours of last brushing and mouthwash, and fasting, the first samples of stimulated&#xD;
      saliva and biofilm (upper and lower right hemi-arch) were collected. Then, the volunteers&#xD;
      brushed the occlusal surfaces and rinsed 10 mL of the mouthwash for 1 min. Soon after, saliva&#xD;
      samples were collected in the following times: t1, t5, t10, t15, t20, t30, t45 and t60&#xD;
      minutes. Later, 1 hour after the mouthwash, the biofilm samples (left side) were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulated saliva (chewing on a silicone) was collected for 2 min, posteriorly the saliva&#xD;
      samples were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 minutes in order to separate the saliva debris.&#xD;
      The biofilm was collected from all tooth surfaces, in both buccal and lingual areas, using a&#xD;
      3S hollenback spatula, from which the samples were immediately transferred to an eppendorff&#xD;
      tube, centrifuged, subsequently dried at 60 °C for 4 h and then weighed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the concentration of fluoride:The samples were analyzed by the&#xD;
      hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) facilitated diffusion method of Taves [21] modified by Whitford&#xD;
      [22]. The analyzes were performed with a fluoride specific electrode (model 9409; Orion&#xD;
      Research) and a potentiometer (model EA 940; Orion Research, Cambridge, MA, USA) (Model 720 A&#xD;
      Orion). Fluoride standards (1-100 nM) were used to prepare calibration curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:Statistical analysis were performed in software R considering α = 0.05.&#xD;
      The Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov Smirnov tests were applied to evaluate the normality of the&#xD;
      data. The comparisons of F concentration in saliva and biofilm between groups were performed&#xD;
      by repeated measures ANOVA after the Bonferroni test. The AUC measure (area below the curve)&#xD;
      was calculated to indicate the efficacy of F retention in the saliva over the long term by&#xD;
      taking the F concentration values in the time interval from 12h to 60 min after the last&#xD;
      rinse. The relationship between fluoride concentrations in biofilm and saliva was determined&#xD;
      using Spearman's correlation coefficient. The data was calculated on Graph Pad Prism (version&#xD;
      6) and Statistical Package (SPSS) version 23.&#xD;
