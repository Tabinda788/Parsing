  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2/3, randomized, multisite, open-label, dose confirmation, and&#xD;
      expansion study is to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of zilovertamab vedotin (ZV) in&#xD;
      combination with standard of care options for the treatment of rrDLBCL. This study will be&#xD;
      divided into 2 parts: Dose Confirmation (Part 1) and Safety Run-in and Efficacy Expansion&#xD;
      (Part 2) and will enroll participants who are at least 18 years of age with rrDLBCL. The&#xD;
      hypotheses are: ZV in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) is&#xD;
      superior to R-GemOx with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) per Lugano response&#xD;
      criteria by blinded independent review committee (BICR); and that ZV in combination with&#xD;
      bendamustine rituximab (BR) is superior to BR with respect to PFS per Lugano response&#xD;
      criteria by BICR.&#xD;

In the Safety Run-in all participants will be assigned to one treatment group and in Efficacy Expansion, all participants in each cohort will be assigned to 2 treatment groups for the duration of study.</intervention_model_description>
