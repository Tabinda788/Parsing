  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to examine the effect of two different tube detection on pressure&#xD;
      wound formation in the intensive care unit. The search was carried out with a total of 60&#xD;
      patients that 30 of 60 them are interventions and 30 of 60 as experiments, who were&#xD;
      hospitalized in the anesthesia and reanimation intensive care unit of an Educational Research&#xD;
      Hospital. The 60 patients who made up the sample were assigned 2 groups using a computer&#xD;
      program that produced random numbers. For the purpose of the study, the groups were encoded&#xD;
      as groups A and B, and each group was tested with two different endotracheal tube detection&#xD;
      methods which was applied to the patients in the groups. Data from the study were collected&#xD;
      using the introductory and clinical features form, the braden pressure wound risk diagnostic&#xD;
      scale, the pressure ulcer recovery assessment scale, the international pressure wound staging&#xD;
      system, and the eilers oral assessment guide. Patients in both groups were monitored for four&#xD;
      days for oral presure injury. During this process, the tube detection of both groups was&#xD;
      changed every 24 hours, and the tubes were repositioned every 4 hours. At the end of the&#xD;
      fourth day, wound assesments of patients who developed pressure wounds were performed by&#xD;
      using the international pressure staging system and the pressure ulcer recovery assessment&#xD;
      scale. Relatives of the patients who were scheduled to conduct the study were informed about&#xD;
      the study by oral and written and their consent was obtained.&#xD;

    <description>During this process, the tube detection of endotracheal tube holder was changed every 24 hours, and the tubes were repositioned every 4 hours. On the first day of the study, the oral mucosa of patients in this group was evaluated by the eliers oral evaluation guide.Then, with the Braden pressure wound risk diagnostic scale, patients ' Pressure Wound risk assessment was performed. Patients in this group were monitored for four days for oral pressure wound as of the day they were intubated. During this process, patients ' tube holder was changed every 24 hours and the tube was repositioned every 4 hours. At the end of the fourth day, wound evaluation of patients who developed pressure wounds was performed using the international pressure wound staging system and pressure ulcer Recovery Assessment Scale. In addition, pressure wounds of patients who developed pressure wounds were treated in accordance with the recommendation of a plastic surgeon.</description>
