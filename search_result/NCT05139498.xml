  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conservative in situ management is a promising alternative treatment to hysterectomy for&#xD;
      patients with placenta accreta spectrum and may be safer and preferable for some patients.&#xD;
      This study will assess feasibility of a future randomized clinical trial comparing these&#xD;
      treatments and provide novel data to inform shared decision-making and cost-effective care&#xD;
      for patients with this deadly pregnancy disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is an extremely morbid and increasingly common pregnancy&#xD;
      condition that often results in massive obstetric hemorrhage. The standard treatment in the&#xD;
      United States is hysterectomy, but this treatment is complex, morbid, and costly. A promising&#xD;
      alternative for PAS treatment is conservative in situ management (CM), a strategy in which&#xD;
      the placenta is left in the uterus. Unfortunately, there are insufficient data available to&#xD;
      compare outcomes of these two treatments because past studies are limited by non-randomized&#xD;
      study designs, minimal inclusion of patient values in making treatment decisions, and nominal&#xD;
      consideration of economic barriers to care. A large clinical trial comparing PAS treatments&#xD;
      is needed. But there are key logistic barriers to an adequately powered trial, including&#xD;
      questions of whether patients will enroll and adhere to randomization allocation. This pilot&#xD;
      trial will evaluate the feasibility of randomizing patients to CM versus hysterectomy for&#xD;
      PAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While pilot studies cannot make final assessments of safety and efficacy between&#xD;
      interventions, safety and efficacy will be monitored, including those related to hemorrhage,&#xD;
      transfusion, infection and re-operation.&#xD;
