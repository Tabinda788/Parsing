  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In adult patients, intraocular pression readings are often taken with an air puff tonometer&#xD;
      or goldmann tonometer. The current gold standard for IOP measurement is the Goldmann&#xD;
      Applanation Tonometry (GAT). In some patients, measurement of intraocular pressure taken by&#xD;
      applanation or by air puff may prove to be impossible for various reasons (obesity, handicap,&#xD;
      mental disorder, blindness for Air Puff Tonometry, Anxiety, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also many other devices that can be used to measure IOP, including those using&#xD;
      rebound tonometry like the Icare 200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rebound tonometer would systematize IOP screening because of its ease of use, provided&#xD;
      its measurements are reliable. In this prospective study, investigators will be measuring&#xD;
      participant's IOP with Goldmann Applanation Tonometry, Icare 200 Tonometer and Air Puff&#xD;
      Tonometry to see if there is an agreement in IOP between the different devices. Investigators&#xD;
      will also look if there is a concordance between central corneal thickness and IOP. Moreover,&#xD;
      investigators will look if there is a IOP concordance between the 3 different devices for&#xD;
      hight BMI people. Indeed, higher body mass index tend to have difficulties with proper&#xD;
      positioning at the slit lamp that may lead to inaccurate GAT measurements. Additionally,&#xD;
      stress level of the patients with different tonometry devices will be recorded using a visual&#xD;
      analog scale.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Goldmann applanation tonometry remains the gold standard for intraocular pressure measurement&#xD;
      in 2021. It provides the most exact approximation of true intraocular pressure based on&#xD;
      Imbert Fick's law. The statistical normal (Gaussian distribution) of IOP is 15.8 plus or&#xD;
      minus 5.14mmHg (2 standard deviations). Thus, an IOP value is considered to be pathological&#xD;
      if it is greater than 21mmHg. In practice, the measurement with the Goldmann tonometer is&#xD;
      done in a seated position due to the need to be installed behind a slit lamp. An anesthetic&#xD;
      drop such as oxybuprocaine or tetracaine is instilled onto the ocular surface followed by a&#xD;
      fluorescein drop. GAT may be associated with discomfort due to the need for topical&#xD;
      anaesthesia which causes a burning sensation during about 30 secondes. Moreover, the patient&#xD;
      must be compliant and the need to be seated makes measurement very difficult for some&#xD;
      patients: pediatric, dementia, hight BMI or elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rebound tonometers determine intraocular pressure by bouncing a small plastic tipped metal&#xD;
      probe against the cornea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As IOP increases, impact time decreases and rebound increases. It is portable, does not&#xD;
      require the use of eye drops and is particularly suitable for children and non-cooperative&#xD;
      patients. The examination is painless and can be performed without contact anesthesia.&#xD;
      Different versions of tonometer using this principle exist. With the Icare 200 six&#xD;
      measurements are taken. The 2 extreme values are eliminated and the average of the 4&#xD;
      remaining values gives the IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy subjects, the Icare tonometer gives results comparable to those of the Goldmann&#xD;
      tonometer (1) with differences of less than 3 mmHg in 80% of cases (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, the type of rebound tonometer differs from that used in our study. Most of&#xD;
      the previous studies compare the Icare RT01i, the Icare PRO, the Icare ONE, the Icare HOME or&#xD;
      even the Icare 100 which are much older versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Icare 200, the most recent model dating from 2018, has benefited from technical&#xD;
      improvements. Intraocular pressure can be taken in any position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one article in the literature has studied the diagnostic performance of Icare200 to&#xD;
      date. In this study, Icare200 was compared with the Perkins tonometer in 2 groups of people,&#xD;
      one group of healthy subjects and one group of patients with congenital glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, we have no studies investigating the diagnostic performance of the iCare200 compared&#xD;
      to the Goldmann tonometer. It is the interest of this study to compare the relationship of&#xD;
      the IOP measurements obtained by Icare 200, Air Puff Tonometer and Goldmann Applanation&#xD;
      Tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this we have chosen to carry out a prospective study. We have chosen to include&#xD;
      consenting adult patients consulting in ophthalmology consultation at Clermont-Ferrand&#xD;
      University Hospital. This results in a large panel of patients with different IOP in order to&#xD;
      observe enough IOP variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOP measurements appear to correlate with corneal pachymetry (3). So, we chose to organize 4&#xD;
      subgroups according to pachymetry estimated by TONOREF III (high pachymetry, i.e. corneal&#xD;
      thickness greater than 560um; low pachymetry, i.e. corneal thickness less than 500um; normal&#xD;
      pachymetry, i.e. corneal thickness between 500 and 560um and subnormal pachymetry, i.e.&#xD;
      corneal thickness between 500 and 520um).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient anxiety during tonometry will be measured using a visual analogue scale.&#xD;
