  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial tests two self-regulatory approaches to improve&#xD;
      intentional weight loss and diet quality in individuals with overweight or obesity: (1) an&#xD;
      environmental control strategy (AVOID) and (2) an impulse control training strategy (RESIST).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based weight management programs are effective when individuals are able to&#xD;
      consistently adhere to recommendations. However, a large proportion of treatment-seeking&#xD;
      individuals do not experience clinically significant weight loss. Innovative strategies are&#xD;
      needed to optimize behavior change in weight management interventions. The proposed&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial tests two self-regulatory approaches to improve intentional&#xD;
      weight loss and diet quality in individuals with overweight or obesity: (1) an environmental&#xD;
      control strategy (AVOID) and (2) an impulse control training strategy (RESIST). Specifically,&#xD;
      500 women and men (BMI between 25-39.9 kg/m2) will be recruited from the Cedars-Sinai Medical&#xD;
      Center network of hospitals and clinics. All participants will be enrolled in a 12-month&#xD;
      weight-management program (WW, formerly Weight Watchers©) focusing on diet, physical activity&#xD;
      and mindset skills, and randomized to one of four study arms: (1) WW only, (2) WW +&#xD;
      modification of home food environment and online grocery delivery (AVOID), (3) WW + gamified&#xD;
      inhibitory control training (RESIST), (4) WW + AVOID + RESIST. Baseline, 6- and 12-month&#xD;
      assessments will be completed by experienced, English and Spanish speaking study staff. Aim 1&#xD;
      (Outcomes). (a) Tests how AVOID and RESIST affect weight loss and waist circumference&#xD;
      (primary) and diet quality (secondary). H1a: AVOID and/or RESIST (arms 2, 3, 4) will result&#xD;
      in greater weight loss at 6-month and 12-month timepoints compared to WW alone. (b) Tests&#xD;
      potential ripple effects of AVOID and RESIST on available household members' diet quality&#xD;
      (primary) and weight (secondary). H1b: The investigators predict that AVOID (arms 2 and 4)&#xD;
      will produce greater dietary changes in household members than WW alone and RESIST (arms 1&#xD;
      and 3). Aim 2 (Mechanisms). Tests the mechanistic pathways of AVOID and RESIST by (a)&#xD;
      comparing longitudinal changes in inhibitory control and home food environment across study&#xD;
      arms; and (b) whether inhibitory control and the home food environment mediate the&#xD;
      relationships between study arms and anthropometric and dietary outcomes. H2: AVOID will&#xD;
      produce changes in the home food environment and RESIST will operate on inhibitory control.&#xD;
      Aim 3 (Moderators). Examines how (a) individual characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, household composition, physical activity, baseline BMI and executive&#xD;
      functioning), and (b) process data (frequency of grocery delivery, dining out and take out,&#xD;
      impulse control training and WW app use) moderate the relationship between study arms and&#xD;
      anthropometric and dietary outcomes. These considerations are important to help explain&#xD;
      heterogeneity in intervention outcomes and to understand who benefits from AVOID and/or&#xD;
      RESIST.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in BMI from baseline to 12 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-month, 12-month</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diet quality assessed by 24h-dietary recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-month, 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>Gold standard interviewer-administered, multi-pass 24h-recalls (2 weekdays, 1 weekend day) will be used to measure diet quality. The Nutrition Data System for Research software (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota) is used to analyze the data. Investigators will use the 24h-recalls to assess changes in participants and household members' overall diet quality, based on adherence to the dietary guidelines for fruits and vegetables, servings of whole grains, red/processed meat, alcoholic beverages and food/beverages with added sugars.</description>

    <measure>Home availability of healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-month, 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>Trained staff will conduct structured interviews with participants to assess the availability of fruits and vegetables, servings of whole grains, red/processed meat, alcoholic beverages and food/beverages with added sugars in participants' homes. Responses will be scored as availability of healthy foods and beverages (e.g., fruits and vegetables), and availability of less healthy foods and beverages (e.g., processed meat, food/beverages with added sugars).</description>

    <measure>Executive Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-month, 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function®- Adult Version (BRIEF-A) is a standardized measure of executive functions or self-regulation in everyday environment. The BRIEF-A assesses nine non-overlapping theoretically and empirically derived clinical scales: Inhibit, Self-Monitor, Plan/Organize, Shift, Initiate, Task Monitor, Emotional Control, Working Memory, and Organization of Materials. BRIEF-A is available in English and Spanish and can be computer-administered. Baseline score on the BRIEF will be tested as moderator of the relationships between study arms and outcomes.</description>

Data conferred by the WW program will also be leveraged, as participants track their activity (type, duration and intensity) via the WW mobile app or online website. Investigators will examine how engagement in exercise and daily activities moderate the relationships between study arms and outcomes.</description>
