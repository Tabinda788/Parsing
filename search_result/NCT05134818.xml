  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Learning to insert a central venous catheter (CVC) is essential in anesthesiology and the use&#xD;
      of simulation is recommended. Since 2017, this training has been integrated into the&#xD;
      curriculum for incoming first year anesthesia residents in Île de France and combines a&#xD;
      theoretical part (flipped classroom) and a practical part on a simulator. Given the large&#xD;
      number of residents, the time to teach the procedure during the simulation session is&#xD;
      limited. To increase the positive effects of the simulation when the learner is in the role&#xD;
      of observer, some authors have proposed to strengthen the educational effect through the use&#xD;
      of an observer tool that observers must complete by analyzing the progress of the task&#xD;
      performed by their colleagues. This is a list describing the set of key points to be&#xD;
      achieved. However, data concerning the educational value of these observer tools are limited.&#xD;
      Studies on the use of these tools during crisis management training in the operating room&#xD;
      assessed by high-fidelity simulation has been already conducted but not on their use during&#xD;
      procedural simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study will be to assess the value of using an observer tool (OT)&#xD;
      (including the key points during the insertion of an internal jugular CVC) to improve&#xD;
      learning outcomes of incoming anesthesia residents during procedural simulation training.&#xD;

      Learning to insert a central venous catheter (CVC) is essential in anesthesiology and the use&#xD;

      of observer, some authors have proposed to strengthen the educational effect through the use&#xD;
      of an observer tool that observers must complete by analyzing the progress of the task&#xD;
      performed by their colleagues (2). This is a list describing the set of key points to be&#xD;
      achieved. However, data concerning the educational value of these observer tools are limited.&#xD;
      Studies on the use of these tools during crisis management training in the operating room&#xD;
      assessed by high-fidelity simulation has been already conducted but not on their use during&#xD;
      procedural simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study will be to assess the value of using an observer tool (OT)&#xD;
      (including the key points during the insertion of an internal jugular CVC) to improve&#xD;
      learning outcomes of incoming anesthesia residents during procedural simulation training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective and randomized study will be performed in the simulation center of&#xD;
      Paris-Saclay University (LabForSIMS). This training takes place annually at the beginning of&#xD;
      the first six-month rotation during an initial training seminar (&quot;bootcamp&quot;). All incoming&#xD;
      residents (approximately 90 residents / year) participate on a mandatory basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each CVC insertion training session includes a theoretical part carried out in the form of&#xD;
      flipped classroom (sending pedagogical documents upstream) and a practical part on a&#xD;
      simulator. Each practical session (1h30, about 7 residents/1 instructor) is repeated twice&#xD;
      during the half-day. The workshop has three stages: theoretical reminder, supervised practice&#xD;
      on echogenic gelatin to learn needling under ultrasound, then supervised practice on a CVC&#xD;
      simulator (part task chest trainer allowing ultrasound visualization) for the insertion of&#xD;
      CVC. Each resident trains at least once on this simulator and is an observer of the other&#xD;
      training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, residents will be included. Each session will be randomized upstream&#xD;
      by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group with observer tool (OT +) during practical training on a simulator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group without observer tool (OT-) The observer tool used will be adapted from a&#xD;
           previously published checklist which includes the main items to be carried out when&#xD;
           inserting a CVC. It will be completed by residents from the OT + group each time another&#xD;
           resident is observed. It will only be used to reinforce learning and will not be used&#xD;
           for summative evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be a composite score describing acquisition of the CVC procedural&#xD;
      skills immediately after training by comparing the groups using or not the OT (level 1-2-3 of&#xD;
      the Kirkpatrick model). The composite score (used in one of our previous studies [Blanié A et&#xD;
      al. 2021 submitted]) includes: knowledge MCQs (/ 20), perception of practical (/ 10) and&#xD;
      theoretical (/ 10) improvement of knowledge and skills, perception of the future professional&#xD;
      impact of this training (/ 10) and satisfaction with the training session (/ 10). All items&#xD;
      scored out of 10 will be measured by a Likert scale from 0 to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will include separate analysis of each item of the composite score.&#xD;
      Moreover, initial retention will be analyzed at 1 month, using the same items as above.&#xD;
      Evaluation of professional practice will also be recorded by the resident during the 1st&#xD;
      month after the training and will include the number of CVCs placed and for each CVC&#xD;
      insertion via the internal jugular route (for the first 5): the number of punctures, success&#xD;
      or failure, complications (pneumothorax, arterial puncture, others) (level 3 and 4 of the&#xD;
      Kirkpatrick model).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reminder will be sent every two weeks and a medical book will be offered to each resident&#xD;
      who will have fully completed the questionnaire.&#xD;
