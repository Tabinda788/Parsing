      Hip fracture surgeries have become one of the most frequently performed surgeries with the&#xD;
      increase in the aging population in recent years. Perioperative fluid management of geriatric&#xD;
      patients who become prone to dehydration due to malnutrition, decreased functional capacity,&#xD;
      impaired cognitive functions after hip fracture development; It is important in terms of&#xD;
      reducing complications in the postoperative period and perioperative hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional approach to perioperative fluid administration is the fluid deficit for the&#xD;
      fasting period with the '4-2-1' rule (4ml/kg/hr for the first 10 kg, 2ml/kg/hr for the second&#xD;
      10 kg, 1ml/kg/hr for each subsequent kg). ) calculation. The fluid and blood losses in the&#xD;
      surgical area and the fluid deficit are estimated and replaced. In order to replace the&#xD;
      volume deficit caused by blood loss, crystalloid is used 3 times the amount of bleeding,&#xD;
      taking into account the crystalloid movement into the extravascular compartment. Static&#xD;
      parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, and urine volume, which are followed in fluid&#xD;
      management with the traditional approach, support the estimation of intravascular volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining intravascular euvolemia throughout the perioperative period is ideal. Both&#xD;
      hypovolemia and hypervolemia are associated with increased postoperative morbidity. While&#xD;
      vasoconstriction due to hypovolemia, decreased oxygen delivery, decreased tissue perfusion&#xD;
      and dysfunction in peripheral organs can be observed; Tissue edema due to hypervolemia,&#xD;
      impaired tissue perfusion, local inflammation, delayed wound healing, wound infection and&#xD;
      anastomotic leaks can be seen. There is no clear consensus on how to perform optimal fluid&#xD;
      management in this population, which has many comorbidities and is at high risk for&#xD;
      postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The search for an optimal fluid regimen to avoid excessive intravascular volume overload and&#xD;
      maximize tissue perfusion has brought individualized targeted fluid replacement therapies&#xD;
      with the help of developing technology. In the targeted therapy (HYT) approach, basic&#xD;
      physiological variables related to cardiac output or global O2 distribution are measured with&#xD;
      the aim of improving tissue perfusion and clinical outcome. Replacement by crystalloid,&#xD;
      colloid or blood products is adjusted according to the dynamic process according to the&#xD;
      measured physiological variables. Methods such as pulmonary artery catheter, esophageal&#xD;
      doppler, central venous pressure measurement, echocardiography, lactate, central venous&#xD;
      saturation, thoracic bioimpedance and arterial waveform analysis can be used to determine&#xD;
      physiological targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial waveform analysis provides estimation of cardiac output based on continuous analysis&#xD;
      of the waveform, a complex physiological signal determined by the interaction of left&#xD;
      ventricular stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, and vascular compliance. Arterial&#xD;
      waveform analysis stands out because it can measure continuous cardiac output and does not&#xD;
      require a central venous catheter. There are invasive, minimally invasive and non-invasive&#xD;
      waveform monitoring systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the methods used in the evaluation of intravascular volume status is the evaluation of&#xD;
      the diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its collapsibility, which changes with&#xD;
      respiration. It can be done at the bedside, it is a fast and noninvasive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferior vena cava collapsibility index (cIVC) can be used as an indicator of fluid response&#xD;
      and a guide in fluid management in critically ill breathing spontaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several meta-analyses have reported that individualized targeted perioperative fluid&#xD;
      managements reduce organ-specific complications in patients undergoing major surgery. In a&#xD;
      study, it was stated that targeted fluid therapy in patients with proximal femur fractures&#xD;
      decreased the total amount of fluid administered and could reduce postoperative&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the necessity of providing adequate intravascular volume in perioperative fluid&#xD;
      management is obvious, an optimal fluid management guideline has not been established in&#xD;
      geriatric and emergency cases with high mortality. The investigators aimed to compare the&#xD;
      cIVC measurements and perioperatively administered fluid volumes of the patients who the&#xD;
      investigators performed fluid management with the arterial waveform analysis method, which&#xD;
      measures the minimally invasive continuous cardiac output, and the patients with whom the&#xD;
      investigators had fluid management with traditional methods, and to examine the postoperative&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
