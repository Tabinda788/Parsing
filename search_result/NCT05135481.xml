  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are registering a randomised controlled trial to assess whether dedicated,&#xD;
      intensified lactation support is as good as frenotomy on the incidence of breastfeeding among&#xD;
      term infants with ankyloglossia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to include a total 316 infants. The study will be carried out in level&#xD;
      III hospital in Warsaw, Poland. The primary outcome will be exclusive breastfeeding at 12&#xD;
      weeks of age. Secondary outcomes include breastfeeding &gt; 50% of feedings, improved&#xD;
      breastfeeding comfort as assessed by the mother, weight gain, head circumference and length&#xD;
      gain, the need to use a breast pump or lactation accessories, time of breastfeeding&#xD;
      cessation, the type of lactation, neurological and rehabilitation assistance received, the&#xD;
      frequency of obtained lactation, neurological and rehabilitation assistance.&#xD;

    <description>Management in group 2 will include increased lactation care both during hospital stay and post discharge.&#xD;
Increased lactation care will consist of:&#xD;
individual consultations on how to properly attach the baby to the breast (at least 3 meetings during hospitalization with personnel trained in lactation counselling), regular (at least once a week) contact with a breastfeeding consultant as part of a closed group on social media or by phone, if necessary (expressed by the mother or based on a referral by a member of the lactation team) an outpatient appointment at the breastfeeding clinic.</description>
