  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With CPIP the investigators opt for a manualized modular psychotherapy designed especially to&#xD;
      meet the needs of children with internalizing disorders that suffered or still suffer from&#xD;
      emotional or physiological neglect. CPIP helps the child to resolve rigid conflictual&#xD;
      internal representations/ working models by individually focusing on caregiver-child&#xD;
      interaction, mentalization based interventions with children and caregivers and working with&#xD;
      the therapeutic transference relationship with the child and the caregiver. Treatment&#xD;
      sessions will take place at CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the study is that for children with internalizing disorders and&#xD;
      experience of emotional / physical neglect, CPIP &amp; enhanced caregiving support (intervention&#xD;
      group) is superior in reducing internalizing symptoms compared to ECS alone (control group).&#xD;
      Potential predictors of treatment response, as family context, gender and age, will be&#xD;
      examined. Furthermore, the investigators will investigate possible treatment effects and&#xD;
      mediating mechanisms, especially changes in DNA methylation profiles, HPA-dysregulation,&#xD;
      cognitive-emotional styles, and emotional availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional elements: If the child additionally suffers from traumatic experiences of violence&#xD;
      or sexual abuse, elements of Tf-CBT will be applied. Furthermore, elements of Interaction&#xD;
      Guidance and ABC including video feedback will be applied in joint caregiver-child sessions.&#xD;
      Treatment fidelity: Following the previous study, manualization, careful training and regular&#xD;
      supervision will strive to ensure high treatment fidelity which will be systematically&#xD;
      assessed in a random sample of two videotaped sessions per family.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Setting: Typically, 25 weekly sessions of approximately 50 minutes; in the clinician's&#xD;
      office, family home, or child protection service office (due to the limited compliance&#xD;
      expected from some families to attend regular therapeutic sessions). When conducting&#xD;
      treatment sessions in the home environment, principles of established and evidence-based home&#xD;
      visitation programs, like SafeCare or Nurse-Family Partnership Program will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic elements: Reflective developmental guidance, modeling appropriate emotional&#xD;
      availability, understanding of the meaning and function of the symptoms within relationships&#xD;
      together with the caregivers, identifying and labeling feelings and actions, creation of a&#xD;
      &quot;neglect narrative&quot; (parallel to a trauma narrative) and conflict interpretation together&#xD;
      with the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three treatment phases: Session 1-5: Building of a working alliance, assessment of&#xD;
      family/individual problems and resources, focus formulation; Sessions 6-20: Therapeutic work&#xD;
      on the focus; Session 21 to 25: Detachment of the working alliance, summarizing, concluding,&#xD;
      fostering future development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic strategy: The inner conflict which is currently most pressing and actively&#xD;
      determining the child's symptoms as well as jeopardizing mental development in the present&#xD;
      will be identified and formulated during the first 5 sessions together with the caregivers&#xD;
      and the child (therapeutic &quot;focus&quot;). The following treatment phase concentrates on the&#xD;
      jointly identified problem/conflict that has been aggregated in the focus formulation. The&#xD;
      setting will vary (number of parent-only, child-only, and caregiver-child sessions) as a&#xD;
      function of whether the focus predominantly lies in the interpersonal (caregiver-child&#xD;
      interaction) or intrapersonal realm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Condition: Enhanced Caregiving Support (ECS) will serve as the control condition&#xD;
      provided by the Allgemeine Sozialdienst (ASD - Community Social Services) of the two&#xD;
      participating cities. According to German law (§ 27 SGB VIII), caregivers are entitled to&#xD;
      receive caregiving support (CS; &quot;Hilfe zur Erziehung&quot;) in cases where the child's wellbeing&#xD;
      is jeopardized. CS generally includes supportive work across all child-relevant systems&#xD;
      (family, neighborhood, (pre-)school, peer group etc.). Appointed social workers and educators&#xD;
      provide parenting counseling, family support, and intensive child support according to an&#xD;
      individualized helping plan (&quot;Hilfeplan&quot;). In more severe cases, children are placed in&#xD;
      (temporary) day-care centers, children's homes, foster families etc. Within the context of&#xD;
      the trial, the investigators will appoint an additional multi-systemic case manager to each&#xD;
      case to enhance the quality of case coordination (enhanced CS; ECS). All children and&#xD;
      families will receive ECS. the investigators will compare children receiving CPIP plus ECS to&#xD;
      children receiving ECS only.&#xD;

    <description>We assume superiority of CPIP &amp; ECS compared to ECS alone in reducing internalizing symptoms of participating children. The Child Behavior Checklist 4-18 (CBCL 4-18) - a well-established internationally used questionnaire that reliably and validly captures child internalizing symptoms. The primary efficacy endpoint (pEP) is the CBCL 4-18 internalizing symptoms score (IntS), rated by the primary caregiver at t3 (post-treatment).&#xD;
The scale ranges from 0-62 with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>
