  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center before-after trial design. The object is to observe whether the&#xD;
      incidence of central line associated blood stream infection(CLABSI) will tend to descend&#xD;
      compared with retrospective electronic medical record data after implementation of an&#xD;
      infusion management scheme which comes form &quot; Clinical Practice Guideline on Infusion Therapy&#xD;
      in Children &quot; .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infusion therapy is an important part in pediatric ward. Most hospitalized children need&#xD;
      indwelling vascular access devices to receive infusion therapy. Much attention has been paid&#xD;
      to possible serious or fatal complications due to immature immune system, poor communication&#xD;
      ability and cognitive disorder in children during catheter placement, use and maintenance.&#xD;
      Reducing the complications related to central venous catheter has become the focus of the&#xD;
      global health care system. Studies have shown that the technical level of operators is in&#xD;
      connection with the incidence of CLABSI, and an intravenous infusion team (IV Team) is the&#xD;
      key to preventing CLABSI, which may fundamentally improve the clinical outcomes of pediatric&#xD;
      patients. From December 2021 to April 2023, taking Children's Hospital of Fudan University as&#xD;
      the leading center, Xiamen Children's Hospital, Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital, Dalian&#xD;
      Municipal Women and Children's Medical Group, Tongji Hospital, First Affiliated Hospital of&#xD;
      Guangxi Medical University, Qidong Women's and Children's Health, Chengdu Women's and&#xD;
      Children's Central Hospital, Hunan Children's Hospital as the cooperation centers. A&#xD;
      retrospective review of electronic medical record data will be collected first. The&#xD;
      intervention is composed of setting up a pediatric intravenous infusion team; carrying out a&#xD;
      quality improvement in collecting and sending suspected CLABSI samples; providing infusion&#xD;
      training curriculums to nurses in forms of lectures, group discussions, operation&#xD;
      demonstrations, and scenario simulations, holding practice review meeting with them;&#xD;
      providing elements to caregivers of educational leaflet, nurse-provided education during&#xD;
      patients' infusion therapy.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During the 6-month implementation</time_frame>
    <description>CLABSI diagnostic criteria requires that a central line is in situ at the time of or within 48 hours; children with a central line have fever (over 38℃), chills, hypotension or mental state changes; there is no alternate source of bloodstream infection. Apart from the above three necessary requirements, CLABSI diagnosis could be accompanied by two positive blood cultures drawn from a peripheral vein and a CVAD, two positive blood cultures drawn from different CVADs, one positive blood culture from a CVAD with a planned specific antimicrobial therapy or common skin contamination bacteria cultured (eg. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, diphtheroids, Bacillus or Micrococcus).&#xD;
Incidence of CLABSI = (case numbers of CLABSI)/(Catheter Days per Month)×1000‰.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Inspection rate of suspected CLABSI samples</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to the end of the 6-month implementation</time_frame>
    <description>When there are suspected cases of CLABSI, the physician will prescribe blood culture and the nurse will draw blood within 1 hour and send them for inspection (if antibiotics are needed, blood should be drawn before administration).&#xD;
Suspected CLABSI samples inspection rate= (documented samples for inspection )/(Required samples for inspection)×100%.</description>

    <description>Incidence of infiltration (of Grade2 or higher) and extravasation: The bedside nurses document PIV infiltration and extravasation using &quot;Pediatric PIV Infiltration Scale&quot; during fluid infusing and every shift.&#xD;
Incidence of infiltration (of Grade2 or higher) and/or extravasation = (case numbers of infiltration (of Grade2 or higher) and/or extravasation)/(Catheter Days per Month)×1000‰.</description>

    <measure>Changes of the scores of readiness of internal context</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to the end of the 6-month implementation</time_frame>
    <description>10% of nurses in every participant center will be randomly drawn to complete the investigation questionnaire for the readiness of internal context using self-made &quot;Assessment Tool of Organizational Internal Context (6 items) &quot; and &quot;Assessment Tool of Local Internal Context ( 9 items)&quot;.The purpose of the survey is to evaluate the internal context of evidence-based practice in each participant center. The score of each item is based on Likert 5 grades rating levels from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).</description>
