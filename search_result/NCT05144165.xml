  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      French guidelines on the use of systemic treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis in&#xD;
      adults have been developed by the psoriasis research group of the French Society of&#xD;
      Dermatology using literature available until July 2017 (Amatore et al, 2019). Because several&#xD;
      systemic treatments have been marketed since then, new guidelines are mandatory. The aim of&#xD;
      this study coordinated by the Centre of Evidence of the French Society of Dermatology is to&#xD;
      update the available French guidelines using a Delphi method.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Justification of Delphi methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Delphi method has been widely used for elaboration of guidelines. The goal of the Delphi&#xD;
      method is to solicit group opinion and to combine the opinion of a panel of experts into a&#xD;
      consensus (or dissensus). During a Delphi study, multiple rounds of questionnaires are sent&#xD;
      to a panel of experts with feedback between rounds, allowing experts to re-evaluate their&#xD;
      responses along with the replies of other experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, expert eligibility and data collection A steering committee of members of the French&#xD;
      Centre of Evidence (G. Chaby, F. Corgibet, L. Fardet, S. Leducq, F. Poizeau&#xD;
      https://reco.sfdermato.org/fr/centre-de-preuves-en-dermatologie) and members of the Psoriasis&#xD;
      Research Group of the French Society of Dermatology (M. Chastagner, L. Gouillon), without any&#xD;
      competing interest regarding this topic, will be in charge with elaboration and conduction of&#xD;
      the Delphi study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected experts will be asked whether they agree to participate in the Delphi survey.&#xD;
      Upon acceptance, they will be asked to answer the Delphi study administered using the online&#xD;
      survey Welphi®. Before the first round, demographic information (age, sex, location of&#xD;
      practice, availability of a phototherapy cabin, public or private practice) and competing&#xD;
      interests will be collected. All experts will provide informed consent. Experts will have 2&#xD;
      weeks to complete the online survey with two email reminders. For each round, the number of&#xD;
      experts who completed the surveys will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of consensus For statements with responses on an ordinal 7-point Likert scale&#xD;
      (rating 1, strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree), 'agreement' will be defined as a score of&#xD;
      5-7, 'neutral' by a score of 4 and 'disagreement' by a score of 1-3. Consensus will be&#xD;
      defined as achieved when &gt; 70% experts will vote for a given option on the Likert scale. For&#xD;
      Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), consensus will be defined as achieved if &gt; 70% experts&#xD;
      voted for a particular option. Median and interquartile range (IQR) will be used to describe&#xD;
      the central tendency and dispersion of responses: a &quot;strong statement&quot; will be defined as a&#xD;
      median score of ≥ 6 or ≤ 2 on the Likert scale and 90% votes for MCQs. If consensus is not&#xD;
      reached for one question (using Likert scale or MCQ) after 3 rounds, dissensus is acted. For&#xD;
      this study, four rounds are planned, including round 1 with open-ended questions (see below)&#xD;
      and a maximum of three rounds to obtain consensus.&#xD;

    <description>Round 1 will include&#xD;
3 questions using an ordinal 7-point Likert scale, regarding every systemic treatment that could be prescribed as a first, second or subsequent line, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis without contra-indication to any treatment&#xD;
9 questions using an ordinal 7-point Likert scale, regarding first line therapeutic management of particular forms of psoriasis&#xD;
11 open-ended questions for special indications of each therapeutic agent.&#xD;
Round 2, 3 and 4 Experts will be asked to review the questionnaire based on the information provided in the former round. They will have to re-rate the 12 questions using the 7-point Likert scales. Regarding special indications for each therapeutic agent, expert's comments from round 1 will be synthesized and converted into MCQs for subsequent rounds. If consensus is reached for one question, the question will not reappear in subsequent rounds.</description>
