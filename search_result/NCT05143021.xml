      To implement an effective but low-cost strategy to decrease SCD maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      mortality in Ghana. The objectives are to 1) assess the impact of a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      SCD-obstetric team for decreasing mortality across three hospital sites in Ghana. 2) assess&#xD;
      the implementation fidelity for 2a) preventing and 2b) treating acute chest syndrome in&#xD;
      pregnant women with SCD admitted to the hospital. 3) standardize an ultrasound protocol for&#xD;
      the prospective monitoring of fetal growth among pregnant women with SCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ghana, has a high burden of sickle cell disease (SCD), with a disproportionately high&#xD;
      maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. In 2015, the investigators established a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary SCD Obstetrics team to implement low-technology evidence-based protocols&#xD;
      (EBP) to prevent and treat acute chest syndrome (ACS), which is the leading cause of maternal&#xD;
      death, institute maternal and fetal monitoring, and ensure better-coordinated care for&#xD;
      in-patients. These interventions resulted in an 89.1% risk reduction in maternal mortality&#xD;
      over 13 months. The investigators have designed an implementation protocol that allows for&#xD;
      the systematic tailoring and implementation of this EBP at facilities that employ few (or no)&#xD;
      specialized physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The critical and unanswered question is: can the dramatic reduction in maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      mortalities observed at KBTH be maintained and replicated with high fidelity at other&#xD;
      tertiary hospitals in Ghana? This study, set in a region with the world's highest SCD&#xD;
      prevalence, has the potential to impact maternal and neonatal mortality by tailoring&#xD;
      evidence-based protocols to facilitate use by non-specialized health care providers. This&#xD;
      project has the potential to change the way pregnant women with SCD are managed in Ghana and&#xD;
      the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. If successful, this study will form a blueprint for the&#xD;
      scale-up of this evidence-based protocol across the country and the West Africa sub-region,&#xD;
      where pregnant women with SCD face an uncertain future. Additionally, the project can serve&#xD;
      as a model for training clinical researchers, public health, and social scientists in&#xD;
      implementation science for major interventions in maternal and perinatal health in Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a standards care prospective protocol to test the following two&#xD;
      primary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After implementing a hospital-tailored task-shifting intervention program in the&#xD;
           tertiary hospitals, there will be a 60% relative risk reduction in maternal mortality&#xD;
           among pregnant women with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A. There will be at least a 90% fidelity to evidence-based guidelines for the prevention&#xD;
           of ACS for women with SCD at high risk for ACS (acute pain and post-surgery) B. There&#xD;
           will be at least a 90% fidelity to evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of ACS&#xD;
           for women with SCD at high risk for ACS (acute pain and post-surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-center prospective cohort study involving pregnant women with SCD who&#xD;
      attend antenatal care at three referral hospitals. Participants will be enrolled from the&#xD;
      booking visit over 18 months and managed with the evidence-based clinical guidelines plus&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team standard care protocol and followed up prospectively until delivery&#xD;
      and up to six weeks after delivery.&#xD;
