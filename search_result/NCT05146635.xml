  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, single-center randomized controlled trial is to identify&#xD;
      the optimal adjuvant intravesical therapy in patients with intermediate risk (IR) non muscle&#xD;
      invasive bladder cancer by comparing two commonly utilized intravesical regimens;&#xD;
      intravesical immunotherapy (BCG) and intravesical chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (BC) represents a frequent urologic malignancy, and is mainly diagnosed as&#xD;
      non-muscle invasive, At presentation, approximately 30% of patients have muscle-invasive BC&#xD;
      (clinical T2 or higher) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the natural history of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and its treatment&#xD;
      strategies are highly variable. Although some patients never experience disease recurrence,&#xD;
      others experience disease progression and eventually die of their disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of intravesical treatment, a patient with non-muscle-invasive BC has a 47%&#xD;
      probability of disease recurrence within 5 years of diagnosis and a 9% probability of&#xD;
      progression to muscle-invasive disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-, intermediate- and high-risk categories have been defined to help guide the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with NMIBC (Ta, T1, and CIS). Treatment of NMIBC is now relatively well-defined for&#xD;
      high-risk and low-risk disease presentation, and awaits further refinement through&#xD;
      improvements in therapeutic options .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solitary low-grade tumors, especially smaller lesions (3 cm or less), respond best to&#xD;
      resection and immediate instillation of intravesical agents, whereas higher risk lesions,&#xD;
      such as carcinoma in situ and high-grade T1 stage disease, have demonstrated good response to&#xD;
      BCG when given on a schedule of induction (an initial 6-week course) and maintenance&#xD;
      (3-weekly courses every 6 months for 3 years) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, while low- and high-risk diseases have been well-classified, the intermediate-risk&#xD;
      (IR) category has traditionally comprised a heterogeneous group of patients that do not fit&#xD;
      into either of these categories . As a result, many urologists remain uncertain about the&#xD;
      categorization of patients as 'intermediate-risk' as well as the selection of the most&#xD;
      appropriate therapeutic option for this patient population .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathology of IR NMIBC has been defined by different organizations (American Urological&#xD;
      Association, European Association of Urology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and&#xD;
      International Consultation on Urological Diseases) as those patients with recurrent (&lt;1 year)&#xD;
      low-grade Ta disease, solitary low-grade Ta &gt;3cm, multifocal low-grade Ta disease or&#xD;
      high-grade Ta disease &lt;3 cm .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommendations for therapy from the aforementioned organizations suggest a basic&#xD;
      role for induction and maintenance therapy with either immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Data&#xD;
      from a number of recent trials suggest that BCG with maintenance is superior to maintenance&#xD;
      chemotherapy in this population as regard to recurrence free survival. On the other hand, no&#xD;
      significant benefit of BCG compared with chemotherapy for tumor progression was identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of these studies were limited by its heterogeneity of patients (non-standardized&#xD;
      definition of IR) and non-unified regimen of intravesical treatment (course or utilized&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agent). A well-designed randomized controlled trial with a rigorous&#xD;
      methodology is warranted to provide a solid evidence for best practice in this special group&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
