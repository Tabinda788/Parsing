  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is now clear evidence that children entering kindergarten, that are relatively young&#xD;
      for the grade (e.g., born in the months immediately preceding the school entry cut-off) are&#xD;
      at significantly more risk for receiving an ADHD diagnosis and being prescribed stimulant&#xD;
      medication. These risks appear to be related solely to age of entry when other explanatory&#xD;
      variables are controlled. This situation, termed the &quot;Relative Age Effect&quot;has potentially&#xD;
      serious consequences for kindergarten children (e.g., greater likelihood of being prescribed&#xD;
      psychoactive medication to control behavior).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present proposal aims to develop a teacher intervention to attenuate the impact of the&#xD;
      relative age effect on young kindergarteners with elevated ADHD symptoms, and test the&#xD;
      correspondence between the hypothesized mechanisms and treatment outcomes related to ADHD&#xD;
      (e.g., symptoms, impairment). Following intervention development and refinement, 60 children&#xD;
      entering kindergarten in the fall, and young for the grade, will be randomly assigned to (1)&#xD;
      Kindergarten as Usual (KAU); (2) a Relative Age Effect prevention intervention administered&#xD;
      immediately; or (3) a Relative Age Effect prevention intervention administered mid-year. In&#xD;
      the intervention groups, teachers will be introduced to the relative age effect, receive&#xD;
      information on how to anchor behavioral ratings in developmental norms, and implement a&#xD;
      positive behavioral support to support growth in the child across the kindergarten school&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aims will be to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
      approach as well as the ability of the team to retain young children in a longitudinal trial.&#xD;
      Further, the hypothesized mechanisms (e.g., improved neurocognitive functioning; improved&#xD;
      teacher use of positive behavioral supports) will be measured and correspondence to&#xD;
      hypothesized outcomes (e.g., reduced ADHD symptoms and impairment) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Anticipated benefits include attenuation of any negative effects for children who receive&#xD;
      intervention, and risks include breach of confidentiality and worsening of symptoms initially&#xD;
      if an intervention is instituted. The knowledge to be gained is important as it could reduce&#xD;
      untoward outcomes for the relatively youngest children in the grade.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The entry to kindergarten is one of the most memorable and important milestones in a child's&#xD;
      school career. Positive and quality kindergarten experiences have been associated with&#xD;
      meaningful outcomes sustained into adulthood including greater rates of college&#xD;
      attendance/higher earnings. Kindergarten entry is one of the first educational transitions&#xD;
      made by a family, and it may cause stress and present new challenges for children and&#xD;
      families. Given the increased demands that are associated with school entry and the concerns&#xD;
      parents may have about this developmental milestone, there are numerous popular press and&#xD;
      policy recommendations (e.g., National Association for the Education of Young Children), as&#xD;
      well as empirical papers, that weigh in on the appropriate age to start kindergarten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transition to kindergarten is of particular concern for parents of children with ADHD,&#xD;
      especially those relatively young for the grade. There is converging evidence suggesting that&#xD;
      children who are young for their kindergarten class (e.g., they have a birthdate that falls&#xD;
      within the months immediately preceding the cut-off date, typically August through November)&#xD;
      are at increased risk for a range of negative educational outcomes including lower academic&#xD;
      achievement, grade retention, social impairments, and ADHD diagnosis . These risks appear to&#xD;
      be related to age of entry when other explanatory variables are controlled. Thus, these&#xD;
      studies suggest that the robust evidence that children closest to an arbitrary cut-off date&#xD;
      are disproportionally at-risk for negative social, behavioral, and educational outcomes is&#xD;
      solely a consequence of educational policy - a phenomenon called the Relative Age Effect&#xD;
      (RAE). Together, the consequence of these risks are 1.5x increased ADHD diagnostic rates and&#xD;
      increased ADHD treatment with psychoactive medication for children relatively younger for&#xD;
      their kindergarten grade .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are prominent, candidate mechanisms that may explain the differential risk for children&#xD;
      with ADHD who are also young for the grade. First, if a teacher is basing behavioral&#xD;
      expectations for children in the classroom based on the relatively older children in the&#xD;
      class, children who are relatively younger and have behaviors that are attributed to having&#xD;
      considerable delays, even in situations where the child is acting in a manner consistent with&#xD;
      their chronological age. Over time, if teachers are issuing frequent commands/reprimands, a&#xD;
      coercive process may develop. Second, given expected variability in neurocognitive processing&#xD;
      at this age level, inappropriate demands may fail to facilitate, and potentially even slow,&#xD;
      the development of executive functions. The present proposal aims to reduce functional&#xD;
      impairments and ADHD symptom levels by investigating whether evidence-based school treatment&#xD;
      for ADHD (e.g., positive behavior supports) coupled with teacher training on the RAE results&#xD;
      in improved school functioning for children with elevated ADHD symptoms prior to the&#xD;
      kindergarten year. Further, the potential mechanism for the impairment experienced by&#xD;
      children with ADHD will be explored, by investigating whether the impairments are due to&#xD;
      characteristics of the child (e.g., deficits in neurocognitive development), the classroom&#xD;
      (e.g., teacher classroom management strategies), or both.&#xD;
