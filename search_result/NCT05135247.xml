  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-one sedentary older hypertensive individuals were randomized to four groups: continuous&#xD;
      aerobic training (CA), interval aerobic training (IA), resistance training (R), and control&#xD;
      (C) group. The protocol included 3 sessions of training by week for 12 weeks. C individuals&#xD;
      were instructed to continue their usual activities. They were submitted to the passive tilt&#xD;
      test before and after the research protocol, evaluating the heart rate (HR), low frequency&#xD;
      (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFAα1) and entropy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The individuals were randomized into four groups: continuous aerobic training (CA), interval&#xD;
      aerobic training (IA), resistance training (R), and control (C), which performed physical&#xD;
      exercises three times a week for twelve weeks, with a total of 36 sessions. The tilt test was&#xD;
      performed before and after the research protocol. Individuals in the control group were only&#xD;
      encouraged to maintain their usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of HRV, the baseline conditions (resting in the supine position) were&#xD;
      determined, followed by the passive postural maneuver, which characterizes the tilt test&#xD;
      (table til tat 70 °) in order to determine the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HR: heart rate (sympathetic action)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LF: Low frequency band (Modulated predominantly by the sympathetic system)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HF: High frequency band (Modulated predominantly by the parasympathetic system)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entropy: data complexity or irregularity index showing that, the higher the values, the&#xD;
           better the HRV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DFAα1 (short term detrended fluctuation analysis)&#xD;
