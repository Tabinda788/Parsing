  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed-methods Hybrid Type 1 research design (efficacy study) in which we aim to&#xD;
      conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial and an Implementation Focused Process&#xD;
      Evaluation of a culturally-targeted video and referral screening tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of a culturally targeted video&#xD;
      previously developed by the research team vs. a Spanish-language fact sheet from an&#xD;
      established group on enhancing genetic counseling and testing uptake and psychosocial&#xD;
      outcomes in Latina women at risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the video's efficacy while also gathering data on the&#xD;
      implementation and future sustainability of using the Risk Screening Tool (RST) and video in&#xD;
      community clinics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previously developed and piloted a culturally targeted narrative video in&#xD;
      Spanish to provide HBOC and GCT education to at-risk Latinas. The investigators expanded&#xD;
      traditional approaches to address psychosocial barriers through risk messages designed to&#xD;
      elicit emotional responses; emotions are often stronger predictors of behavior than&#xD;
      cognition. Our video is responsive to Latinas' preferences, targets motivators, and addresses&#xD;
      psychosocial barriers identified in our formative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of our video vs. a fact sheet&#xD;
      from an established group, FORCE, on enhancing GCT uptake and psychosocial outcomes on a&#xD;
      two-arm randomized controlled trial. The investigators will test the video's efficacy while&#xD;
      also gathering data on the implementation and future sustainability of using an adapted Risk&#xD;
      Screening Tool (RST) and video in community clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will partner with community clinics and implement a Risk Screening Tool&#xD;
      (RST) at their practice to identify women at risk of HBOC. Community clinic staff (N~32) will&#xD;
      be asked to participate in a pre-implementation and a post-implementation focus group to&#xD;
      assess implementation outcomes of integrating HBOC screening practices in their clinic.&#xD;
      Through the community clinics, the investigators aim to recruit N~300 Latina women at risk&#xD;
      for HBOC based on their personal or family history of cancer. Latina women at risk for HBOC&#xD;
      will be randomized to a Video arm or FORCE Fact Sheet Arm. All participants in the randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be offered genetic counseling and testing.&#xD;
