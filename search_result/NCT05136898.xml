  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate that home instillation of UGN-102 is a feasible alternative to&#xD;
      instillation in a clinical setting, which might mitigate some of the challenges in the&#xD;
      patient experience (logistical, expense, and comfort) when receiving treatment for low-grade&#xD;
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer at intermediate risk of recurrence (LG IR NMIBC).&#xD;

    <description>Home instillation feasibility questionnaires will be completed by the patient, the home health professional, and the Investigator. Patients will rate their home instillation experience such as comfort, safety/concerns, communication, preference compared to office instillation and overall experience at each home instillation visit. Patient recommendations regarding home instillation will also be collected at the 3-month Visit. Home health professionals will complete a set of questionnaires after each home instillation visit.&#xD;
Investigators will provide their feedback based on the experiences of the patient and the home health professional(s) at the 3-month Visit. Data will be summarized descriptively and feasibility of home instillation will be assessed based on the totality of the data.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 6 once-weekly intravesical instillations of UGN-102. Treatment Visit 1 will occur at the investigative site and instillation will be performed by a qualified physician. Treatment Visits 2 to 6 will occur at the patient's home and instillation will be performed by a properly trained and qualified home health professional.</description>

    <intervention_name>UGN-102</intervention_name>
    <description>UGN-102 consists of mitomycin and sterile hydrogel (a proprietary thermally responsive gel) that is used to reconstitute mitomycin before instillation. The reverse thermal properties of UGN-102 allow for local administration of mitomycin as a liquid, with subsequent conversion to a semi-solid gel depot following instillation into the bladder.&#xD;
The UGN-102 admixture for intravesical instillations contains 75 mg mitomycin in 56 mL admixture (1.33 mg mitomycin per 1 mL).</description>
