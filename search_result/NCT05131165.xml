  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test the feasibility and acceptability of using text messages and behavioral&#xD;
      economics-based incentives to support anchoring Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) adherence to an&#xD;
      existing routine in order to improve long-term ART medication adherence. The intervention&#xD;
      phase of the three-phased study will constitute the pilot RCT. A sample of 150 clients who&#xD;
      have initiated ART in the preceding three months will be randomized to either usual care (C =&#xD;
      50) or one of the two INMIND intervention groups (daily text message reminders with or&#xD;
      without incentives) for three months (T1 = 50; T2=50). Subsequently, behavioral persistence&#xD;
      will be evaluated for six months post-intervention. Assessments will be conducted at&#xD;
      baseline, month 3, and month 9. The primary outcomes are 1) electronically measured mean&#xD;
      medication adherence during the intervention and 2) six months post intervention, along with&#xD;
      3) timeliness of medication adherence during the intervention and 4) six months&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adherence of Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) among HIV-infected patients initiating treatment&#xD;
      (treatment initiators) in Sub-Saharan Africa has remained low, even though the number of&#xD;
      treatment initiators has increased in recent years. Lack of retention in care and low&#xD;
      adherence in the first year of ART treatment are substantial barriers to virologic&#xD;
      suppression. The current R34 study tests a novel approach for improving long-term ART&#xD;
      adherence among treatment initiators by turning adherence into a behavioral routine. This is&#xD;
      done in two ways: 1) anchoring ART adherence to an existing routine, and 2) providing more&#xD;
      immediate rewards and increasing the salience through reminder messages. Insights from&#xD;
      behavioral economics suggest that such an intervention may be particularly effective for&#xD;
      people with present bias (those who have a tendency to give in to short-term temptation at&#xD;
      the cost of more long-term benefits) and lack of salience (where over time, the choice of&#xD;
      target behavior is overshadowed by more pressing needs of daily life) which have been found&#xD;
      to be prevalent among people living with chronic medical conditions from past studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be implemented among 150 adult clients in three groups. The first&#xD;
      intervention group would receive daily text messages that reinforce routine formation&#xD;
      information provided to all participants (across the three groups). The second intervention&#xD;
      group will receive the text messages, and additionally be eligible for a prize drawing based&#xD;
      on timely ART adherence, at each monthly clinic visit. The control group will receive care as&#xD;
      usual, consisting of routine formation information as well as adherence counseling. The&#xD;
      intervention will last three months, with a six-month post-intervention follow up period. All&#xD;
      participants will receive MEMS caps to record adherence, and will complete assessments over&#xD;
      nine months (baseline, post-intervention, and six months post-intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aim of the intervention phase of the study is to test the preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention, including the relative effectiveness of the two different&#xD;
      implementation approaches. This is preceded by the formative phase, with the Specific Aim of&#xD;
      developing the intervention parameters. The intervention phase is succeeded by the adaptation&#xD;
      phase, whose Specific Aim is to collect data in preparation for a subsequent R01 application.&#xD;

    <description>A novel measure of routine adherence (that it is explicitly based on the temporal pattern of pill-taking) will be used. It is calculated as the fraction of scheduled pills taken within a one-hour window around the typical time that participants report completing their existing routine behavior that anchors their pill-taking. This measure provides an objective way for determining behavioral automaticity of pill-taking.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data collected in the execution of the aims described in the application will be shared in the form of journal publications. Following publication of the main paper(s) for this study and the grant end-date, the RAND Human Subjects Protection Committee will be consulted about how to securely make data publicly available in the form of an electronic database for researchers who successfully complete a registration process (described below). Any shared data will be de-identified and will not contain any direct identifiers or indirect identifiers (that could identify participants by inference). No qualitative data will be shared, as such data would be difficult to de-identify given that participants will be telling their own experiences and thus could be identified by inference. Documentation of shared data will be provided in the form of a codebook in which each variable name and response options are defined.</ipd_description>

The data sharing agreement will include a commitment to using the data only for research purposes, a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology, and a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.
