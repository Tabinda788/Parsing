  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare between active distraction (video game) and passive&#xD;
      distraction (cartoon video) using a Virtual Reality ( VR ) device, in reducing injection pain&#xD;
      and anxiety associated with local anesthesia in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This comparative study is a double blinded controlled randomized clinical trial which&#xD;
      includes 82 healthy 6-10 years old children with positive and definitely positive behavior&#xD;
      according to Frankl Rating Scale with no known allergy to local anesthesia, no emergency&#xD;
      dental treatment, no previous treatment from the same researcher and no previous experience&#xD;
      in using the Virtual Reality ( VR ) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the participants will be allocated and treated at department of pediatric dentistry, faculty&#xD;
      of dentistry, Tishreen university and a written consent will be obtained from the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random-numbers table will be used to divide 82 participants in to two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The active distraction group, which will be receiving the injection of local anesthesia&#xD;
           while using the VR device with a video game and a Play Station 4 ( PS4 ) controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The passive distraction group, which will be receiving the injection of local anesthesia&#xD;
           while using VR device watching a cartoon video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will receive an inferior alveolar nerve block with semi supine position.&#xD;
