  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate treatment strategies for IBS used&#xD;
      within primary Health care in Örebro Region.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The defining features of IBS comprise the presence of recurrent abdominal pain in association&#xD;
      with altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation or both), as stated in the Rome IV&#xD;
      criteria. The spectrum, duration and severity of symptoms can range from inconvenient to&#xD;
      incapacitating, and can prevent individuals from participating in everyday activities.&#xD;
      Despite the prevalence of IBS, its management remains a challenge for global healthcare&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of IBS comprises, in summary, information to patients, dietary treatment,&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment and psychological treatment. Pharmacological treatment includes&#xD;
      antidepressants, bulking agents or fiber supplements, rifaximin, linaclotide, eluxadoline,&#xD;
      loperamide, antispasmodics, prokinetics and probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are diagnosed and treated&#xD;
      in primary care, the aim of this project is to investigate the adherence of general&#xD;
      practitioners (GPs) to recommended therapeutic approaches for IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, data regarding therapeutic approaches will be collected retrospectively over&#xD;
      the period of 2013-2019 by using the electronic patient register in Örebro Region. Patients&#xD;
      will be identified by ICD-code K.58. The used treatments will be categorized in grade of&#xD;
      recommendation as well as in strength of evidence. The efficacy of the used treatments will&#xD;
      be evaluated, if possible. Over the counter agents, and lifestyle adjustments will not be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The used treatments will be categorized in grade of recommendation (weak and strong) as well&#xD;
      as in strength of evidence /very low, low, moderate and high). The eventual use of&#xD;
      inappropriate treatments will be recorded as well. The efficacy of the used treatments will&#xD;
      be, if possible, evaluated from the patient registers. The standardized and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires IBS-Symptom Severity Score and IBS-Quality of Life scores are not routinely&#xD;
      used within the primary health care. For this reason, the efficacy of the treatments will be&#xD;
      categorized in &quot;no effect, moderate effect and good effect&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used.&#xD;
