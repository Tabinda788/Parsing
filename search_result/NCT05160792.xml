      Study Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective evaluation study comparing GraduCheck® under the Urgo K2 compression&#xD;
      bandage system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each volunteer, the study is to be carried out over 7 days. This includes one initial&#xD;
      visit to the clinic (The Woundcare Consultants Clinic - with a Covid-secure protocol), and&#xD;
      the completion of an Evaluation Form at home at 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days after the&#xD;
      initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those volunteers who are already on the GraduCheck® evaluation study (Prospective Assessment&#xD;
      to Evaluate the Use of GraduCheck® in Enabling Experienced Tissue Viability Nurses to Achieve&#xD;
      Ideal Sub-Bandage Pressures in Healthy Volunteers. IRAS: 309519) who wish to continue onto&#xD;
      this linked study will already be in the clinic having undergone six compression system&#xD;
      changes already, with the final compression system being one of the two involved in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers should be able to remove the compression themselves at the end of the study but&#xD;
      are welcome to return for a nurse to remove it, if preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is to be initiated at the Woundcare Consultants Clinic (with a Covid-secure&#xD;
      protocol in place) on Day 0. At this venue, volunteers will be assessed, consented,&#xD;
      randomised (if appropriate) and the Urgo K2 compression systems placed on the legs, with the&#xD;
      GraduCheck® device on the appropriate side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first evaluation will be completed by the volunteer under the guidance of the TVN if&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer will then go home with the compression in place on both legs, the evaluation&#xD;
      form and waterproof covers for the compression systems to allow the volunteer to have&#xD;
      showers. The rest of the study will therefore take place at the volunteer's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve (12) healthy volunteers will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study commences, any potential volunteer who expresses an interest in joining the&#xD;
      study will be given a patient information sheet and a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those that have read the patient information sheet and consent form, and still wish to be&#xD;
      involved, will be invited in for assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteer participants who fulfil the above criteria (part from those measured at the&#xD;
      assessment) will be assessed to by using a Doppler Ability ultrasound device to measure the&#xD;
      Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI), exclude any lower limb ischaemic disease. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteer participants must have an ABPI reading between 0.8 and 1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sphygmomanometer cuff will be placed around the lower legs at the ankle, one after the&#xD;
      other, and inflated to 40mmHg. Volunteers will need to be able to tolerate this to be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers who fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria (including the assessment&#xD;
      of ABPI and cuff inflated around the ankle), to a maximum of 12, will be invited to consent&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy volunteers will have been given an opportunity to discuss any points of the study&#xD;
      or consent before signing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the consenting process, the healthy volunteers will be informed that they can&#xD;
      withdraw at any stage, for any reason, without having to tell the organisers of their reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who have already completed the linked study - Prospective Assessment to Evaluate&#xD;
      the Use of GraduCheck® in Enabling Experienced Tissue Viability Nurses to Achieve Ideal&#xD;
      Sub-Bandage Pressures in Healthy Volunteers - IRAS: 309519 will already have the Urgo K2&#xD;
      compression system bandaged on one leg with the GraduCheck® device in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These volunteers will only need the other leg to be bandaged by the same TVN who performed&#xD;
      the primary leg compression, using an identical Urgo K2 dressing system, but without the&#xD;
      GraduCheck® device in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In volunteers who are taking part of this study alone, both legs will be bandaged buy a&#xD;
      single TVN using identical Urgo K2 compression systems on each leg. The side to have the&#xD;
      additional GraduCheck® device will be selected by envelope randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side randomised to the GraduCheck® device will be compressed first, with the TVN using&#xD;
      the GraduCheck® results in real time to ensure optimal pressure profile. They will then&#xD;
      repeat the same compression technique on the other leg, but without a GraduCheck® compression&#xD;
      device being included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer will be given 10 minutes to walk around the room or sit to get used to the&#xD;
      compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then be asked to fill in the first evaluation sheet. This will be done in&#xD;
      conjunction with the TVN to ensure they understand the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer will then be discharged home wearing the Urgo K2 compression on each leg, with&#xD;
      the GraduCheck® device on one side. They will be discharged with the evaluation form and&#xD;
      instructions to complete it the following day open brackets day one or close brackets day 3&#xD;
      and day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An appointment will be made for the volunteer to return for the TVN to remove the compression&#xD;
      and GraduCheck® device, and to hand in the completed form. if the volunteer has elected to&#xD;
      remove the dressings themselves, they will return to hand in the GraduCheck® device and the&#xD;
      completed evaluation form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A] for volunteers involved in linked study IRAS: 309519 who are continuing onto this study If&#xD;
      the volunteer has already been involved in the study: Prospective Assessment to Evaluate the&#xD;
      Use of GraduCheck® in Enabling Experienced Tissue Viability Nurses to Achieve Ideal&#xD;
      Sub-Bandage Pressures in Healthy Volunteers - IRAS: 309519, this second study will continue&#xD;
      from the end of the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By being part of the previous study, the volunteer will have already undergone assessment and&#xD;
      will have the Urgo K2 compression system on one leg with the GraduCheck® system in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore for these volunteers, the protocol is for the same TVN who performed their Urgo K2&#xD;
      compression to do the same with an identical system on the other leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With both legs being compressed, one with the GraduCheck® device in place, these volunteers&#xD;
      can now join the common protocol below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B] for volunteers new to this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who did not take part in the linked study Prospective Assessment to Evaluate the&#xD;
      Use of GraduCheck® in Enabling Experienced Tissue Viability Nurses to Achieve Ideal&#xD;
      Sub-Bandage Pressures in Healthy Volunteers - IRAS: 309519 will follow the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will be assessed by having their ankle brachial pressure (ABPIs) measured and&#xD;
      noted (must be between 0.8-1.2) and have a blood pressure cuff placed around the lower leg&#xD;
      just above the ankle on each side and inflated to 40 mm Hg to ensure they can tolerate the&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provided this assessment is satisfactory, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria are fulfilled,&#xD;
      the volunteer will go through the consenting process for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provided that they give consent and are happy to proceed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - the leg to be treated with the Urgo K2 compression system with the GraduCheck® device&#xD;
           in place (the index leg) will be selected by envelope randomisation. It will either be&#xD;
           left or right.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - the TVN will perform compression of the selected leg using the Urgo K2 as per&#xD;
           manufacturer's instructions. However, when the first layer is put on, the GraduCheck®&#xD;
           device will be placed on the first layer of bandaging in the anterior lateral position&#xD;
           of the lower leg. The bandaging will then be completed using the pressure measured by&#xD;
           the GraduCheck® device to ensure the correct pressure profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - once the compression system with GraduCheck® is in place on the index leg, the same&#xD;
           TVN will immediately apply an identical Urgo K2 compression system to the other leg&#xD;
           (control leg) aiming to emulate the same compression pressure that they used on the&#xD;
           index leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Common study processes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - the volunteer will now have an Urgo K2 compression system on both lower legs, both&#xD;
           applied by the same TVN, with a GraduCheck® device in place on the index leg and without&#xD;
           on the control leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The volunteer will be asked to walk around and sit down as they wish to for 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - after 10 minutes, provided the volunteer is comfortable with the compression system on&#xD;
           each leg, the volunteer will go through the Day 0 section on the evaluation form and&#xD;
           complete it. The TVN will be present if there are any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - the volunteer will then be allowed home with the compression system in place on both&#xD;
           legs which will then stay in place for the next 7 days and nights (GraduCheck® k on the&#xD;
           index side), with the evaluation form and plastic coverings for the lower legs to enable&#xD;
           the volunteer to have showers whilst wearing the compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. - the volunteer will complete the evaluation form on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 3&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. - the volunteer will return to the study centre one week after the start of the study&#xD;
           for the compression to be removed, the GraduCheck® device and evaluation form handed in.&#xD;
           If the volunteer has removed their own compression bandaging before this time, they will&#xD;
           bring it in to the study centre to return the compression bandaging and GraduCheck®&#xD;
           device along with the evaluation form.&#xD;
