  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several epidemiological studies have shown that premenopausal women are protected from&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases compared to men of the same age; however, after menopause&#xD;
      (postmenopause), the cardiovascular risk increases progressively to equal the cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk of men of the same age group. In addition, in Mexico, the incidence of women entering&#xD;
      the postmenopausal stage with overweight or obesity increases each year. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      essential to generate public initiatives to reduce the metabolic and physiological&#xD;
      alterations caused by overweight/obesity and improve postmenopausal women's health and&#xD;
      quality of life. Flavonoids are bioactive compounds that have been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk associated with obesity since they participate in the regulation of lipid&#xD;
      metabolism, improve body composition, reduce oxidative stress and inflammation; Therefore,&#xD;
      our objective is to reduce the cardiovascular risk of postmenopausal women and improve the&#xD;
      oxidative and inflammatory state, through oral supplementation with cocoa flavonoids. To do&#xD;
      this, an innovative method will be used to assess cardiovascular risk based on knowledge of&#xD;
      the type, number, and size of lipoprotein particles and knowing the oxidative and&#xD;
      inflammatory state before and after supplementation with cocoa flavonoids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some interventions have been carried out to reduce obesity and the incidence of&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic pathologies since the foods consumed in the daily diet, directly and&#xD;
      indirectly, influence the modulation of metabolic signaling pathways. Flavonoids, nutrients&#xD;
      of plant origin, have beneficial effects on health since they can prevent and reduce the&#xD;
      impact of overweight/obesity. Significant benefits have also been shown in blood pressure,&#xD;
      platelet reactivity, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, insulin sensitivity, and prostaglandin&#xD;
      metabolism, improving health in patients with chronic diseases related to metabolic disorders&#xD;
      and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food rich in flavonoids is cocoa; the plant contains many polyphenols (anthocyanidins,&#xD;
      proanthocyanidins, and catechins), concentrated mainly in the pods and seeds, which provides&#xD;
      a highly bitter taste. The polyphenols that can be identified in cocoa beans are (-) -&#xD;
      epicatechin and, to a lesser extent (+) - catechin, (+) - gallocatechin, and (-) -&#xD;
      epigallocatechin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyphenols derived from cocoa are characterized by being powerful antioxidants, by having&#xD;
      effects on muscle and fat tissue: inducing the darkening of adipocytes (change from white&#xD;
      adipocytes (fat deposit) to beige adipocytes; promoting mitochondrial biogenesis; increasing&#xD;
      the expression of vital thermogenic genes and upstream regulators of fatty acid oxidation;&#xD;
      reducing serum TG concentrations; phosphorylating metabolism regulators and acetylating&#xD;
      (activating) proteins involved in mitochondrial structure and function. Actions culminate in&#xD;
      regulating the metabolic profile, decreasing adipose tissue, increasing muscle mass, and,&#xD;
      therefore, decreasing BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence of the beneficial effects of cocoa polyphenols as antioxidants, improving&#xD;
      the lipid profile levels and pro and anti-inflammatory markers. Cocoa is one of the foods of&#xD;
      natural origin with high antioxidant capacity due to the tricyclic structure of flavonoids.&#xD;
      The compounds act as electron donors and stabilize free radicals through their aromatic rings&#xD;
      with hydroxyl substituents. Cocoa polyphenols have been shown to protect cells from oxidative&#xD;
      stress at the membrane level by reducing lipoperoxidation and DNA damage through the&#xD;
      chelating action of the catechol group and hydroxyl substituents. Furthermore, cocoa&#xD;
      flavonoids inhibit xanthine oxidase, NADPH-oxidase, tyrosine kinases, and protein kinases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cocoa polyphenols have been shown to have antioxidant activity that helps counteract the&#xD;
      atherosclerotic process by reducing the activation of NADPH oxidase. In addition, to improve&#xD;
      the dilation of the arteries in smoking patients with atherosclerosis. The antioxidants in&#xD;
      cocoa inhibit LDL oxidation, which is related to delaying atherosclerotic progression by&#xD;
      reducing ox-LDL and increasing HDL-c.&#xD;
