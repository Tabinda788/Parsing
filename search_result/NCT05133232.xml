  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of adult long term disability and the fourth leading cause of death&#xD;
      and affects 1·8/1000 persons in Singapore. Post-stroke functional recovery of upper limb is&#xD;
      poor with 80% of stroke survivors having some upper limb disability during the acute to&#xD;
      subacute phase after stroke. Early rehabilitation is paramount for enhancing the survival and&#xD;
      independence of stroke patients and inadequate supervised therapy hours is closely associated&#xD;
      with poor rehabilitation outcome. However, high intensity and high repetition therapies,&#xD;
      which facilitates neuroplasticity, have historically had a poor uptake because it is manpower&#xD;
      intensive and places a high demand on stroke patients, many of whom cannot cope. High fatigue&#xD;
      and sustained levels of effort are also generally perceived as placing the patient at risk if&#xD;
      done at home without trained supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic rehabilitation system can provide high-intensity, repetitive, task-specific,&#xD;
      interactive treatment of the impaired upper limb and can serve as an objective and reliable&#xD;
      means of monitoring patient progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke subjects also have a wide spectrum of disability resulting in unconscious&#xD;
      co-contractions and compensatory muscle use. Although these disability elements are widely&#xD;
      acknowledged to be present, technological tools for identifying and quantifying these are&#xD;
      missing. This technology gap affects the optimization of therapy and the patients'&#xD;
      understanding of their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of using the SynPhNe device outside of&#xD;
           conventional therapy time, compared with conventional occupational therapy alone, on&#xD;
           hand motor function in acute and subacute stroke patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the feasibility of the use of SynPhNe by acute and subacute stroke patients&#xD;
           with minimized supervision;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate subject and staff perceptions in terms of usability and benefit of the&#xD;
           device;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study clinical outcomes, EEG, EMG and TMS changes over the course of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the cost-benefit of SynPhNe therapy on inpatients with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SynPhNe therapy will have added benefit compared to conventional occupational therapy&#xD;
           alone on hand motor function in acute and subacute stroke patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SynPhNe can be used with minimal supervision by acute and subacute stroke patients so&#xD;
           that the efficiency of rehabilitation is increased;&#xD;

      Stroke is a major cause of adult long term disability and the fourth leading cause of death&#xD;
      and affects 1·8/1000 persons in Singapore. Post-stroke functional recovery of upper limb is&#xD;
      poor with 80% of stroke survivors having some upper limb disability during the acute to&#xD;
      subacute phase after stroke. Early rehabilitation is paramount for enhancing the survival and&#xD;
      independence of stroke patients and inadequate supervised therapy hours is closely associated&#xD;
      with poor rehabilitation outcome. However, high intensity and high repetition therapies,&#xD;
      which facilitates neuroplasticity, have historically had a poor uptake because it is manpower&#xD;
      intensive and places a high demand on stroke patients, many of whom cannot cope. High fatigue&#xD;
      and sustained levels of effort are also generally perceived as placing the patient at risk if&#xD;
      done at home without trained supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic rehabilitation system can provide high-intensity, repetitive, task-specific,&#xD;
      interactive treatment of the impaired upper limb and can serve as an objective and reliable&#xD;
      means of monitoring patient progress. However, robotic rehabilitation technologies have not&#xD;
      had the wide-ranging impact that was once expected. Not only are they difficult to afford for&#xD;
      the general population but their training options are limited, with most of them allowing&#xD;
      basic joint movements such as wrist extension, finger extension and the like, rather than&#xD;
      actual everyday tasks and activity level training. Those devices that provide a wider variety&#xD;
      of everyday task training are more complex and expensive and few are designed to be used at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke subjects also have a wide spectrum of disability which includes muscle weakness, lack&#xD;
      of control, cognitive deficits, joint pain, and deeply embedded, maladaptive muscle couplings&#xD;
      resulting in unconscious co-contractions and compensatory muscle use. Although these&#xD;
      disability elements are widely acknowledged to be present, technological tools for&#xD;
      identifying and quantifying these are missing. This technology gap affects the optimization&#xD;
      of therapy and the patients' understanding of their condition. In many cases, patients are&#xD;
      unable to grasp why there is no visible progress despite sincere effort, leading to&#xD;
      discouragement and an eventual drop out of therapy. Conversely, a therapist may conclude no&#xD;
      further improvement is feasible and place the patient on maintenance exercises. It is well&#xD;
      known that patients may be required to follow different therapy roadmaps for hand function&#xD;
      depending on the nature and extent of deficits. This would involve not just strength training&#xD;
      but also co-ordination, organization, and goal-based execution. To be truly effective, a&#xD;
      rehabilitation platform must be able to deliver a wide range of tasks and activities in a&#xD;
      guided manner while measuring incremental as well as overall performance in a quantitative&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we intend to fill the gap using SynPhNe- a physio-neuro platform. It can&#xD;
      provide an early, repetitive and task-specific hand rehabilitation with less supervision&#xD;
      using correct muscle groups and muscle synergies of stroke patients. It also can engage&#xD;
      physical and cognitive aspects of stroke patients. We had previously conducted a study using&#xD;
      the SynPhNe device in chronic stroke patients and found an average of 6.3% improvement in the&#xD;
      upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer score (p=0.015), and a 22% improvement in the&#xD;
      Action Research Arm test (p=0.003) after a 4 week intervention (DSRB 2012/00521). Just as&#xD;
      with conventional therapy, we expect that the effect will be more pronounced in the acute to&#xD;
      sub-acute stages of stroke when there is a greater degree of neuronal plasticity. Hence, we&#xD;
      propose this study, where we intend to explore the use of the SynPhNe to: 1) increase the&#xD;
      time the stroke-affected hand is used in therapeutic activity; 2) improve the effectiveness&#xD;
      of upper extremity rehabilitation; 3) reduce the length of inpatients hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study aims: 1) To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of using the SynPhNe&#xD;
      device outside of conventional therapy time, compared with conventional occupational therapy&#xD;
      alone, on hand motor function in acute and subacute stroke patients; 2. To evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the use of SynPhNe by acute and subacute stroke patients with minimized&#xD;
      supervision; 3. To investigate subject and staff perceptions in terms of usability and&#xD;
      benefit of the device; 4. To study clinical outcomes, EEG, EMG and TMS changes over the&#xD;
      course of the study; 5. To compare the cost-benefit of SynPhNe therapy on inpatients with&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1. SynPhNe therapy will have added benefit compared to conventional occupational&#xD;
      therapy alone on hand motor function in acute and subacute stroke patients; 2. SynPhNe can be&#xD;
      used with minimal supervision by acute and subacute stroke patients so that the efficiency of&#xD;
      rehabilitation is increased; 3. SynPhNe therapy is a cost-effective inpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: This will be a prospective cohort study recruiting 40 stroke subjects upon their&#xD;
      admission to the inpatient rehabilitation unit at AH within 4 months of stroke. Subjects will&#xD;
      be given the option to participate in the active SynPhNe intervention arm, or participate as&#xD;
      controls. 20 subjects will be recruited to the intervention arm and 20 to the control arm.&#xD;
      Subject drop-outs will be replaced to meet the recruitment target. All subjects will continue&#xD;
      with their conventional occupational therapy (OT) as per usual medical care plan. The&#xD;
      subjects in the SynPhNe arm will receive training with the device for 15-18 sessions over the&#xD;
      course of 4 weeks, in addition to conventional occupational therapy. If the subject is&#xD;
      discharged before completing the required training sessions, they will be requested to&#xD;
      complete the remaining sessions at outpatient clinic, or at home being supervised remotely&#xD;
      via Microsoft team viewer. Among them, the first 5 subjects will be supervised fully for all&#xD;
      training sessions, the subsequent subjects, we will attempt to decrease the amount of&#xD;
      supervision provided after the first 5 sessions, according to the competence of the subjects&#xD;
      to navigate the system independently. The control group will continue with conventional&#xD;
      occupational therapy without training with SynPhNe device. Subject who drops out from the&#xD;
      intervention group but has completed the first session for the introduction of the use of&#xD;
      SynPhNe device, will be given an option to be enrolled in the control group. Both groups will&#xD;
      undergo outcome measurements at pre-intervention, post intervention and 4 weeks after&#xD;
      intervention by staff who is blinded to the intervention allocation, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical outcome measures for upper limb function: the upper extremity of the Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
           scale, Action Research Arm Test, ,grip strength, 9-hole peg test, Modified Ashworth&#xD;
           scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. EQ5D;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) measures of cortical excitability for those&#xD;
           without TMS contraindications; The outcome measures for the control group is the same as&#xD;
           above, and will be done at similar timepoints, i.e., after recruited (pre), after 15-18&#xD;
           session of conventional occupational therapy (post), and 4 weeks later (post 4-weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subject's convenience, post assessment and post 4 weeks assessment are allowed to be&#xD;
      completed within 1 week after the actual dates. Subject's medical history, length of&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation stay, FIM score at recruitment, number of conventional therapy&#xD;
      sessions and duration, will be retrieved from subject's medical record. The following&#xD;
      information will also be collected in order to evaluate the application of SynPhNe device in&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject questionnaire which will include questions on usability, perceptions of the&#xD;
           device and its effectiveness;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Caregiver strain index;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SynPhNe device training protocol will last approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be automatically collected by the SynPhNe device during the&#xD;
      course of the training:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of sessions of training with SynPhNe device, duration of each session;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EEG/EMG scores during rest and various stages in the therapy protocol. 3. Environment&#xD;
           parameters: temperature, noise, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress in ability to perform grasping, picking, reaching, transferring and object releasing&#xD;
      based on visual data will be recorded by video camera. The video recording is necessary to&#xD;
      correlate and verify EMG data changes in the course of different therapy actions. The face&#xD;
      and identifiers of subjects will not be captured. If it is accidentally captured, the video&#xD;
      for that session will be deleted after the training session. TMS measurement of corticospinal&#xD;
      excitability was performed by a trained research staff. Resting motor threshold (RMT), short&#xD;
      intra-cortical inhibition (SICI) and short intra-cortical facilitation (SICF) will be&#xD;
      measured using TMS stimulation of the primary motor cortex, with subject sitting upright in a&#xD;
      chair with back supported, looking forward, with both forearms resting comfortably on pillows&#xD;
      and elbows supported at 90 degrees. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are recorded from the&#xD;
      abductor pollicus brevis (APB) via surface electrodes in a belly-tendon arrangement. Single-&#xD;
      and paired-pulse TMS are delivered through a 70 mm figure-of-eight coil, placed on the scalp&#xD;
      with the handle pointing posteriorly at a 45° between the coronal and sagittal planes. The&#xD;
      optimal scalp position for activating APB was determined from initial exploration over a 1-cm&#xD;
      grid marked on a swimming cap worn over the head. RMT is defined by the lowest intensity&#xD;
      eliciting peak-to-peak MEP amplitude of 50µV, in at least 5 out of 10 trials from&#xD;
      single-pulse TMS stimulation. SICI and SICF are measured using paired-pulse stimulation with&#xD;
      a conditioning stimulus of 80% of RMT followed by a test stimulus of 120% of RMT. MEPs were&#xD;
      recorded with different inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs), 2, 3, 6, 10, 15 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: To assess the feasibility of the use of the SynPhNe device with minimal supervision&#xD;
      in a home environment, 10 acute or sub-acute stroke subjects who come from inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation pool preparing for discharge, and their caregivers, will be recruited for&#xD;
      SynPhNe training. The first 5 sessions will be fully supervised by research staff (either&#xD;
      physically at the hospital or remotely via Microsoft team viewer) and the caregivers of the&#xD;
      subject will be trained on the operation of the synphne device. The subsequent sessions will&#xD;
      be assisted by the trained caregiver at home. The protocol, duration and frequency of the&#xD;
      SynPhNe training will be the same as the intervention group of the Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cohort, a caregiver/ facilitator questionnaire on usability and perceived&#xD;
      effectiveness of the device will be administered, in addition to the outcome measures common&#xD;
      to all. &quot;Incidental findings&quot; are findings that have potential health or reproductive&#xD;
      importance to research participants and are discovered in the course of conducting the study,&#xD;
      but are unrelated to the purposes, objectives or variables of the study. There will be no&#xD;
      incidental findings arising in this research, as all outcome assessments in this study are&#xD;
      designed for the purposes of the study- to study clinical outcomes, EEG, EMG and TMS changes&#xD;
      over the course of the study. Clinical outcomes include Action Research Arm Test, Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      Assessment, grip strength, Modified Ashworth scale, 9 hole peg test. All these are&#xD;
      measurement of upper limb motor function. EEG, EMG and TMS measures are for corticospinal&#xD;
      excitability levels. And the questionnaires are for evaluating the feasibility of the use of&#xD;
      SynPhNe by stroke patients.&#xD;
