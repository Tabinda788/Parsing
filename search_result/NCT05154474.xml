  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is defined as reduction in muscle mass and function according to the criteria of&#xD;
      the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in older people. Initially described for elderly&#xD;
      patients, it is also presented as a negative prognostic factor in overall survival in&#xD;
      oncology in certain locations (lung, ENT pathways, colon, pancreas) and more controversially&#xD;
      for hemopathies. Its screening by measurement of skeletal muscle mass by CT scan and / or PET&#xD;
      scan against L3 and by physical functional tests is not routinely integrated despite&#xD;
      international recommendations. Sarcopenia is one of the characteristics of patient fragility&#xD;
      that can induce more complications, lengthen the average length of hospital stay and reduce&#xD;
      overall survival. The PRONOPALL score, a predictor score for survival validated by a previous&#xD;
      study, will be correlated with the presence (or absence) of sarcopenia at inclusion for&#xD;
      patients with a solid tumor (breast, ovary, prostate cancer , kidney, lungs, pancreas,&#xD;
      colorectal). A prospective study on 38 patients with metastatic cancer was carried out at the&#xD;
      Victor Hugo clinic in Le Mans between 01/JUN/21 and 31/AUG/21 (SPACE, ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      number, NCT04714203): 25 patients were analyzable on the CT and PRONOPALL score data with a&#xD;
      prevalence of sarcopenia of 60% and median overall survival of 14 months (unpublished data),&#xD;
      clinical performance and muscle strength tests were not carried out (as in the publications&#xD;
      cited above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study for the detection of sarcopenia is indicated by extending to blood&#xD;
      diseases with the integration of clinical tests included in the initial APA (Adapted physical&#xD;
      activity) assessment recommended for diagnosis.&#xD;
