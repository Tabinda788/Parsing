  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Healthcare providers, particularly nurses, are at risk of infection as part of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 epidemic chain since they assist in the disease's containment. By recognising&#xD;
      the risk factors for infection and implementing suitable measures to reduce these risks, all&#xD;
      reasonable efforts should be taken to control the spread of infection to them. The major aim&#xD;
      of the present study was to determine the level of infection prevention and control practises&#xD;
      used by primary healthcare nurses in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
