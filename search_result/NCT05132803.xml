&#xD;
               1. Unresectable recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression&#xD;
                  on or after chemotherapy whose tumors express PD-L1 [Combined Positive Score&#xD;
                  (CPS) 1] as determined by an FDA-approved test.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Unresectable recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer&#xD;
                  (HNSCC) in either of the following settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i.) The tumor expresses PD-L1 [Combined Positive Score (CPS) 1] as determined by an&#xD;
             FDA-approved test and the patient has received no prior therapy, or ii.)The patient&#xD;
             has experienced disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             c)Metastatic anal cancer that has progressed after prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eligible for and planning to start therapy with anti-PD-1 therapy based on NCCN&#xD;
             guidelines, such as pembrolizumab, every 3 weeks according to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documented to have HPV16 nucleic acid within the tumor specimen as determined by in&#xD;
             situ hybridization. NOTE: HPV16 nucleic acid testing may be done as part of a&#xD;
             &quot;pre-screening&quot; consent at any time prior to enrollment on the primary study. Archival&#xD;
             tissue will be used to perform this test. To be eligible for HPV16 testing on study,&#xD;
             patients must have cancer not amenable to curative therapy and be a candidate for&#xD;
             anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline&#xD;
             (version 1.1) Appendix D, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal&#xD;
             lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) by chest x-ray or as ≥10&#xD;

             demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;

             rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccine&#xD;

             live-attenuated vaccines and are not allowed within 4 weeks of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects of this therapy. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;

             have received potentially curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. The patient has known active central nervous system disease (CNS). For patients with&#xD;
             treated brain metastases, they are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central&#xD;
