  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study on outcomes on bariatric surgery, particularly in terms of metabolic parameters in the&#xD;
      UAE is scant. Also Genetic data from this population is limited and hence a study on genetic&#xD;
      determinants of response to bariatric surgery is highly warranted. This study is expected to&#xD;
      provide a better understanding of the causes of severe obesity in the UAE population and help&#xD;
      us to evaluate the efficacy of Bariatric surgery in patients with genetic forms of obesity.&#xD;
      The information generated will allow us to better advise patients regarding the risks and&#xD;
      benefits of Bariatric Surgery as a treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To investigate the metabolic outcomes of bariatric surgery, to study the prevalence&#xD;
      of monogenic forms of obesity among a cohort of patients with morbid obesity who underwent&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and to compare the outcomes of Bariatric surgery in patients with and&#xD;
      without underlying genetic condition.&#xD;

      Prior to participation, the nature of the study, the objectives of the study, the study&#xD;
      procedures and any known or likely risks including specific information pertaining to the&#xD;
      genetic testing technology will be explained to the subjects by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained after providing an information sheet with details&#xD;
      regarding the study including the genetic analysis performed. The information sheet with&#xD;
      consent form will be available in Arabic and English. The participant (or parent/guardian or&#xD;
      legally authorised representative, as appropriate) must personally sign and date the latest&#xD;
      approved version of the ICF before any study specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the signed ICF will be kept in the medical record, with the study data, and&#xD;
      provided to the participant. The original signed ICF will be retained at the study site for&#xD;
      10 years after the end of the project and should be conveyed to ICLDC, to be stored&#xD;
      electronically, for its records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be informed that their source medical records may be checked by&#xD;
      representatives from the responsible authorities (ICLDC REC, ADHRTC, DOH) with applicable&#xD;
      regulations. However, they will be made aware that all information will be treated with&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
