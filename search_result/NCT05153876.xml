  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache disorders are among the most prevalent medical conditions worldwide. The diagnosis&#xD;
      of headache disorders is based on medical history taking. Digital solutions such as natural&#xD;
      language processing (NLP) may be of aid to understand the linguistic aspects of headache&#xD;
      attack and headache related disability descriptions by patients. Participants will provide a&#xD;
      written description of their headache disorder. The results will hopefully lead to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the potential use of NLP in headache disorders.&#xD;
