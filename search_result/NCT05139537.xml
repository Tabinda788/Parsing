    <textblock>
      : Stroke is leading cause of long-term disability in individuals. The location and extent of&#xD;
      brain injury determines the severity of neurological deficits. The incidence of stroke&#xD;
      dramatically increases in old age. Patients with stroke always come across with problems&#xD;
      associated with balance, vertigo, dizziness and posture resulting in compromised activities&#xD;
      of daily life. This study is aimed to collect data regarding the functional status of&#xD;
      patients due to vestibular and postural impairments with stroke. The study will be&#xD;
      descriptive comparative cross-sectional. It will be conducted at Idress Hospital Sialkot.&#xD;
      This study will be completed within the time duration of six months. Convenient sampling&#xD;
      techniques will be used to collect the data. Both genders with equal ratio will be included&#xD;
      in this study after fulfillments of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Visual vertigo analogue&#xD;
      scale, Dix-Hallpike Maneuver, DHI (Dizziness Handicap Inventory), Posture assessment scale&#xD;
      for stroke (PASS) score, Time up and go test will be used as data collection tools. All data&#xD;
      will be collected after informed consent from patient. All data will be collected under&#xD;
      complete supervision of physiotherapist. All the data will be demonstrated as mean and&#xD;
      percentage. The analysis of data will be done by using SPSS.26(Statistical Package For social&#xD;
      science) and Excel. Statistical significance will be set as P = 0.05. Frequency tables, pie&#xD;
      charts, bar charts will be used to show summary of group measurements measured over time. Our&#xD;
      analysis will provide the association of vestibular and postural impairments with functional&#xD;
      status in both males and females after stroke&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Stroke (cerebrovascular accident CVA) is a medical condition associated with neurological&#xD;
      deficits caused by interruption of blood flow to brain. Main types of strokes are ischemic&#xD;
      (due to blood loss) and hemorrhagic (due to bleeding). Sign and symptoms of stroke may&#xD;
      include inability to move or feel, problem understanding and speaking, dizziness, unable to&#xD;
      walk and dependency in daily life. All these factors effect the functionality of the patient.&#xD;
      If symptoms last less than one or two hours then it is transient ischemic stroke (TIA), also&#xD;
      known as mini stroke. Modifiable risk factors associated with stroke are high blood pressure,&#xD;
      smoking, diabetes, metabolic diseases and obesity. Male gender , ethnicity, family history ,&#xD;
      genetic predisposition and old age all are non-modifiable risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular dysfunction is define as the disturbance in body's balance system. It may be due&#xD;
      to peripheral or central disorders. The peripheral cause for vestibular dysfunction is&#xD;
      peripheral neuritis. The most common cause of the central vestibular dysfunction is an&#xD;
      ischemic stroke of posterior fossa which contains brain stem and cerebellum. Vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunction often present as dizziness. patients with vestibular dysfunction are at high risk&#xD;
      of fall due to vertigo and gait imbalances, postural instability, increased sway and&#xD;
      irregulated gate Risk factors associated with vestibular dysfunctions include female gender,&#xD;
      age more than 40 years, depression and poor educational status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The balance impairments in post stroke state is complex. It includes weight bearing&#xD;
      asymmetry, muscles weakness, increased visual dependency and disturbed perceptions. All these&#xD;
      factors effect the independent functionality of the patient. Postural instability increases&#xD;
      after stroke which result in restriction in independence of daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is relation between dizziness and stoke. Patients with dizziness or vertigo are at&#xD;
      higher risk of stroke than general population. Dizziness is common in patients who experience&#xD;
      stroke for the first time. Dizziness is a cognitive manifestation of disturbed balance system&#xD;
      of body. Dizziness is a risk factor for fall and it has negative influence on quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance is defined as the ability to maintain the center of gravity within base of support&#xD;
      with minimal postural sway. Balance is classified as static and dynamic balance. Static&#xD;
      balance is associated with sitting and standing, while dynamic balance is associated with&#xD;
      walking and running. Insufficient balance in stroke survivors due to sensory and motor&#xD;
      deficits results in decrease activities of daily life and functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from posterior inferior cerebral artery PICA stroke, present with vertigo,&#xD;
      dizziness, vomiting, headache, gait changes, impairments in postural control and horizontal&#xD;
      nystagmus ipsilateral to the lesion. These symptoms are result of a compromised vestibular&#xD;
      afferent sensory input which impairs the motor output for the management/maintenance of&#xD;
      balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find the association between vestibular and postural impairment&#xD;
      on functional status of patients .Our study will also provide the difference of result&#xD;
      between male and females whether they are equally effected or not.&#xD;

    <description>This scale indicates the amount of dzziness patient experince by covering distance of 10cm in different environments scoring 0-10.(43) The VVAS shows high validity and responsiveness to any change detected clinically. The VVAS can also be used to verify the progression of the client's symptoms.</description>
