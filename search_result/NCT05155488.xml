    <textblock>
      The main aims of the study are to learn about the percentage of mucopolysaccharidosis type II&#xD;
      (MPS II) in adults in Brazil as well as about the diagnosis process. No study medicines will&#xD;
      be provided to participants in this study. The data available for participants diagnosed with&#xD;
      MPS II in DATASUS (a database of the Informatics Department of Brazilian Health System) will&#xD;
      be reviewed. No clinic visits will be required as part of participation in this study.&#xD;
