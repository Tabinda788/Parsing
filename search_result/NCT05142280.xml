      In this web-based RCT, we will investigate whether promoting an active choice regarding&#xD;
      coping with an increased CVD risk results in better psychological outcomes (e.g., degree of&#xD;
      active choice; commitment toward the chosen option) compared to usual care (i.e., a GP's&#xD;
      advice to change one's lifestyle and take medicaiton). By 'active choice' we mean a conscious&#xD;
      and autonomous choice in which an individual (a) becomes aware of a discrepancy between the&#xD;
      current and desired situation; (b) understands what his/her CVD risk means, and what its&#xD;
      causes and consequences are; (c) evaluates the pros and cons of the different options to cope&#xD;
      with the risk; and (d) is clear about his/her values regarding the choice. The different&#xD;
      options to cope with an increased CVD risk include: changing one's lifestyle; taking&#xD;
      medication; doing both; or changing nothing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of mortality among adults.&#xD;
      Adults at increased risk of cardiovascular disease are usually advised by their general&#xD;
      practitioner (GP) to change their lifestyle (i.e., quit smoking; eat healthier; become more&#xD;
      physically active). In addition, GP's regularly advice their patients to take&#xD;
      antihypertensive and/or lipid lowering medication to decrease the CVD risk. Previous research&#xD;
      has shown that many patients at increased risk of CVD have difficulty maintaining lifestyle&#xD;
      changes and adhering to their medication regimen - either intentionally or unintentionally.&#xD;
      Intentional non-adherence could occur when patients experience side-effects of the&#xD;
      medication, whereas unintentional non-adherence usually occurs when patients forget to take&#xD;
      their medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we will investigate whether promoting an active choice regarding coping&#xD;
      with an increased CVD risk results in better psychological outcomes (e.g., degree of active&#xD;
      choice; commitment toward the chosen option) compared to usual care (i.e. a GP's advice to&#xD;
      change one's lifestyle and take medication). By 'active choice' we mean a conscious and&#xD;
      autonomous choice in which an individual (a) becomes aware of a discrepancy between the&#xD;
      current and desired situation; (b) understands what his/her CVD risk means, and what its&#xD;
      causes and consequences are; (c) evaluates the pros and cons of the different options to cope&#xD;
      with the risk; and (d) is clear about his/her values regarding the choice. The different&#xD;
      options to cope with an increased CVD risk include: changing one's lifestyle; taking&#xD;
      medication; doing both; or changing nothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate this in a web-based RCT among adults aged 45-65 years. The intervention&#xD;
      group (i.e. active choice group) and control group (i.e. usual care group) will both receive&#xD;
      a hypothetical CVD risk. We expect an active choice regarding coping with an increased CVD&#xD;
      risk to result in better psychological outcomes compared to a GP's advice. Ultimately, a more&#xD;
      active choice is expected to results in greater behavioural persistence regarding the chosen&#xD;
      option; i.e. lifestyle change and/or medication adherence.&#xD;

    <description>This intervention contains information and an assignment to foster an active choice regarding coping with an increased CVD risk. Participants will be presented a hypothetical 'heart age' of 16 years older than their actual age. They will be asked to imagine that this heart age really applies to them. Next, participants will receive information about the meaning of the risk, including its causes and potential consequences, and about four coping strategies: changing one's lifestyle; taking medication; doing both; or changing nothing. The pros and cons of each strategy will be presented, followed by a value-clarification exercise.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive online information and advice that resembles GP's usual care. The information contains a hypothethical CVD risk: a risk of 31% to get CVD within 10 years. They will be asked to imagine that this risk really applies to them. Participants will read about an imaginary GP who advices to change one's lifestyle (i.e., quitting smoking; healthy diet; more physical activity), and to use medication to decrease the risk.</description>

    <description>The active choice intervention aims to promote an active choice regarding coping with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This means that individuals should (a) become aware of a discrepancy between the current and desired situation; (b) understand what the CVD risk means, and what its causes and consequences are; (c) evaluate the pros and cons of the different options to cope with the risk; and (d) are clear about their values regarding the choice.</description>
