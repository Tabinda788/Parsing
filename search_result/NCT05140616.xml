    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is one of the most important&#xD;
      and effective methods for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.Chronic graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease (cGVHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation with few&#xD;
      effective options available after failure of corticosteroids. It is a leading cause of late&#xD;
      nonrelapse mortality for transplant patients, also contributing to morbidity and a decrease&#xD;
      in quality of life.Corticosteroids, the standard frontline treatment, are typically&#xD;
      administered for a median of 2 to 3 years, leading to substantial morbidity. An effort to&#xD;
      decrease corticosteroid doses has led to their use in combination with other&#xD;
      immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus, in frontlineor&#xD;
      second-line settings, despite a lack of clinical evidence supporting additional efficacy&#xD;
      after combining these agents with corticosteroids. B and T cells play a rolein the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of cGVHD. Previous studies have shown that low-dose histone deacetylase&#xD;
      inhibitors (HDACi) have a negative immune regulation in GVHD while maintain the GVL effect.&#xD;
      Chidamide is one of new HDACis in China, the previous studies suggested that low dose&#xD;
      Chidamide could reduce condition of cGVHD mice by regulating the immune homeostasis of&#xD;
      follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. Chidamide also has effects on the regulation of antigen&#xD;
      presenting cells, the activation donor T cells, the release of proinflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      the function of Treg cells. Furthermore, low-dose Chidamide has the potential to maintain GVL&#xD;
      effects. In preclinical models,Chidamide reduced severity of cGVHD. Based on the biological&#xD;
      rationale and preclinical data, a study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Chidamide in patients with cGVHD who was steroid-resistant/steroid-dependent .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Promoting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and inhibiting chronic graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (cGVHD), is the key to improve the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (allo-HSCT). Previous studies have shown that low-dose histone deacetylase&#xD;
      inhibitors (HDACi) have a negative immune regulation in aGVHD while maintain the GVL effect.&#xD;
      Chidamide is one of new HDACis in China, its immune regulatory role in cGVHD is unclear. The&#xD;
      results suggested that low dose Chidamide could reduce condition of cGVHD mice by regulating&#xD;
      the immune homeostasis of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. Chidamide also has effects on the&#xD;
      regulation of antigen presenting cells, the activation donor T cells, the release of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines and the function of Treg cells. Furthermore, low-dose Chidamide has&#xD;
      the potential to maintain GVL effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis,a study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Chidamide in&#xD;
      patients with cGVHD who was steroid-resistant/steroid-dependent.To Evaluate the Safety and&#xD;
      Tolerability of Chidamide in Steroid Dependent/Refractory cGVHD.Number of participants with&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities as a measure of safety profile to determine recommended dose of&#xD;
      Chidamide.&#xD;

           insufficiency, decompensated liver insufficiency, renal insufficiency, etc.;Clinically&#xD;

           immunosuppressants could be tapered during the study as clinically indicated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point was safety, tolerability and efficacy,which included the number of dose limiting toxicities occurring on Chidamide. The primary efficacy endpoint was the best overall cGVHD response rate on 3 montns and 6 months, which was defined as the proportion of all patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).&#xD;
It will begin with the evaluation of the safety of the dose (Chidamide 15mg biw po, lasted for 8 weeks) with the potential for subsequent dose reductions if dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are detected. A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any drug-related hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity Grade 3 or higher.&#xD;
Best overall cGVHD response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a NIH-defined complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during the study.</description>
