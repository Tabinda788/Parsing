      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avatrombopag in the&#xD;
      treatment of thrombocytopenia after Allo-HSCT.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with thrombocytopenia after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (Allo-HSCT) who meet Eligibility Criteria were randomly assigned into the avatrombopag group&#xD;
      and the rhTPO treatment group(standard group) with 1:1 ratio. The study is divided into two&#xD;
      stages, including 4-weeks' core study and 4-weeks' extended study.&#xD;
