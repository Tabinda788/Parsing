  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA) is a battery of cognitive tests&#xD;
      delivered via an electronic tablet or smartphone. The overarching goal of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the post-acute trajectory of cognitive functioning in patients hospitalized for&#xD;
      COVID-19 using the DANA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sequelae of COVID-19 are increasingly appreciated to be systemic and persistent among&#xD;
      certain populations. Retrospective review of severe COVID-19 cases revealed increased altered&#xD;
      mental status, encephalitis, psychosis, and neurocognitive abnormalities in the three weeks&#xD;
      following discharge. During severe COVID-19 infection, there is additional evidence of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events, including ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. The most&#xD;
      common long-term neurological sequelae are loss of taste/smell, headache, and vertigo.&#xD;
      However, there is additional evidence for cognitive impairment among those with severe&#xD;
      COVID-19, with 33% of patients discharged from one intensive care unit (ICU) exhibiting&#xD;
      clinically relevant inattention, disorientation, and poorly organized movements. Another&#xD;
      study utilizing a three-week telephone cognitive screening four weeks after discharge showed&#xD;
      that 42% of those who experienced delirium during ICU stay had lasting lower cognitive scores&#xD;
      compared to those who did not experience delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of currently available knowledge about neurocognitive symptoms associated with&#xD;
      COVID-19 comes from cross-sectional studies of patients in the acute setting. Existing data&#xD;
      suggests that following hospitalization, COVID-19 survivors may most frequently demonstrate&#xD;
      deficits in letter-cued verbal fluency and executive function. However, this body of research&#xD;
      is in its early stages and further investigation is needed. The model of traditional&#xD;
      face-to-face cognitive testing using paper and pencil instruments is poorly suited to a&#xD;
      global infectious disease pandemic. The Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA)&#xD;
      is a battery of cognitive tests delivered via an electronic tablet or smartphone. The&#xD;
      platform allows higher temporal precision and frequency of measurement than traditional&#xD;
      neuropsychological methods while including previously standardized cognitive tests and&#xD;
      allowing individuals to repeatedly self-administer the battery in the individuals' own homes&#xD;
      without examiner supervision. Hence, the DANA battery bypasses several of the major&#xD;
      limitations associated with in-person cognitive exams.&#xD;

    <description>Severity of COVID-19 will be determined based on patient classification within the PACT (Johns Hopkins Post-acute COVID-19 Team) clinic. Specifically, patients followed in the PACT-ICU clinic required ICU stays of ≥48 hours and high-flow nasal cannula/non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation. Those followed in the PACT-Base clinic have less severe disease that does not necessitate ≥48 hours in the ICU but does qualify for PACT clinic referral based on either (1) ongoing pulmonary and/or rehabilitation needs at the time of hospital discharge, or (2) persistent pulmonary or functional deficits at 4-6 weeks post infection without hospitalization.</description>
