  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred blepharitis patients will be recruited. Each patient will treat one eye once&#xD;
      daily with 1% PVI for 30 days by scrubbing the eyelid margin with the solution. The fellow&#xD;
      eye will serve as the control and be given the standard treatment (commercial eye wipes).&#xD;
      Before treatment initiation, various ocular surface variables will be assessed, such as dry&#xD;
      eye grading, subjective discomfort scales, ocular surface questionnaire, and other clinical&#xD;
      signs. After 30 days, an identical evaluation will be performed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blepharitis is a chronic and very common inflammation of the eyelid margin affecting patients&#xD;
      of all ages. This condition can be categorized anatomically (anterior- skin and eyelashes,&#xD;
      posterior- meibomian glands), and pathophysiologically (staphylococcal, seborrheic, parasitic&#xD;
      [Demodex mites], and meibomian gland dysfunction [MGD]). Combined forms of the disease are&#xD;
      not uncommon. Signs and symptoms include itching, redness, flaking, and crusting of the lids,&#xD;
      along with ocular surface disturbances such as irritation, dryness, tearing, and corneal&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since no definitive cure is available, treatment recommendations for blepharitis focus on&#xD;
      management. They may include eyelid hygiene using warm compresses and scrubbing, topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids, topical and oral antibiotics, and dietary adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Povidone-iodine (PVI) is a widely used antimicrobial agent. Utilization of PVI is prevalent&#xD;
      in disinfection of the eye and surrounding skin before intraocular procedures such as&#xD;
      cataract surgeries and intravitreal injections. The antiseptic properties of PVI enable it to&#xD;
      effectively reduce ocular surface and conjunctival colonization of various pathogens.&#xD;
      Therefore, novel uses of ocular PVI seem promising, and some were already assessed in&#xD;
      clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal concentration of PVI is also a matter of debate. High concentration solutions&#xD;
      (5-10%) have greater potency, yet they increase corneal endothelial and epithelial toxicity.&#xD;
      Although they may require repeated applications, low concentration solutions (0.1-1%) were&#xD;
      proven to be safer and effective and are widely utilized in some countries. However, data&#xD;
      regarding the option of treating blepharitis with PVI are lacking, as no comparative or&#xD;
      controlled studies have been published to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the aim is to investigate the efficacy of lid scrubbing with PVI 1% in the&#xD;
      treatment of anterior blepharitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, observer-masked study. The allocated eye will&#xD;
      be specified in a sealed envelope, given to the patient upon recruitment to the study. All&#xD;
      investigators will be masked to the treated eye for the duration of the study. The fellow eye&#xD;
      will serve as the control. Before treatment initiation, all outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      (specified below). Eligible participants will be assigned to use 1% PVI once daily on either&#xD;
      the right or left eye for 30 days. During the first week of treatment, patients will be&#xD;
      called to ensure the correct eye is being treated. Patients will be instructed to clean the&#xD;
      eyelids and lashes of the study eye with 1% PVI using makeup remover pads (will be supplied&#xD;
      to patients). Following treatment, patients will remove residual PVI with a wet makeup pad.&#xD;
      The fellow eye (control eye) will receive regular treatment for blepharitis: eyelashes&#xD;
      cleansing with commercially available eyelid wipes. Patients will be invited to a follow-up&#xD;
      examination after 30 days. All outcomes will be re-assessed after 30 days of treatment.&#xD;
