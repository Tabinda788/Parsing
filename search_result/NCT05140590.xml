  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug interactions (IFF) are events that occur when multiple drugs are administered at the&#xD;
      same time to an individual. People with arterial hypertension generally require therapeutic&#xD;
      regimens based on 2 or more drugs for their adequate control, which makes them patients with&#xD;
      polypharmacy. When these patients require urgent medical attention, there is a risk that IFFs&#xD;
      will occur between their base treatment and the drugs that are prescribed to solve the added&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To determine the frequency of pharmacological interactions between&#xD;
      antihypertensive regimens and drugs used in the emergency service of Hospital General de Zona&#xD;
      No 51 (HGZ 51).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: Observational, descriptive, and prospective study. The participants&#xD;
      will be eligible patients with systemic arterial hypertension treated in the emergency room&#xD;
      of HGZ 51 in GÃ³mez Palacio, Durango. Support systems will be used for clinical decision, to&#xD;
      identify potential IFFs and to be able to classify them according to their mechanism&#xD;
      (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) and severity. A descriptive statistical analysis will&#xD;
      be carried out in the SPSS program using measures of frequency, dispersion and central&#xD;
      tendency.&#xD;

      The researchers will invite individuals with high blood pressure who come to the emergency&#xD;
      department in the period from January 2021 to December 2021 to participate in the study. They&#xD;
      will be questioned about the selection criteria, and if they are eligible to be included in&#xD;
      the study, they will be provided with the informed consent letter for reading, clarification&#xD;
      of doubts and signature. Each participant will receive a copy of the informed consent letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be questioned directly to obtain information about their general data,&#xD;
      medical history and about their drug treatment for hypertension. The rest of the data&#xD;
      (admission diagnosis, drugs administered during their hospital stay, etc.) will be obtained&#xD;
      from the clinical record, as well as the blood pressure measurements on admission, during&#xD;
      their hospital stay and upon discharge. The analysis of the theoretical pharmacological&#xD;
      interactions and their classification will be carried out prior to feeding the database using&#xD;
      the IBM Micromedex Drug Interactions and iDoctus Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained will be emptied into an Excel database for subsequent statistical&#xD;
      analysis with the SPSS 21 program. The study information will remain confidential under the&#xD;
      responsibility of the responsible researcher. As a protection measure on the information&#xD;
      collected for the investigation, the personal identification data will be substituted by&#xD;
      folio numbers.&#xD;
