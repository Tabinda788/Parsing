  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although it is well known that stress plays an important role in the development of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric diseases, the precise role and molecular effects of stress have only been&#xD;
      poorly understood. For example, autophagy is essential for energy and cellular homeostasis&#xD;
      through protein catabolism, and dysregulation results in compromised proteostasis,&#xD;
      stress-coping behavior, and excessive secretion of signaling molecules and inflammatory&#xD;
      factors. Therefore, the aim of the project is to analyze the clinical effects of a bungee&#xD;
      jump resembling an acute stress event in correlation to autophagy and other underlying,&#xD;
      multi-level molecular profiling. Specifically, it is planned to perform multi-level molecular&#xD;
      profiling and sleep analysis in a cohort of healthy male individuals before, during, and&#xD;
      after a bungee jump compared to a control cohort of healthy males not undergoing a stress&#xD;
      event. The resulting findings will advance the role of autophagy during the stress response&#xD;
      and hence in the development of psychiatric disorders, and possibly investigate alternative&#xD;
      treatment venues on a molecular level, and finally contribute to a better clinical outcome.&#xD;

      Although it is well known that stress plays an important role in the development of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric diseases, the molecular effects of stress have only been poorly understood.&#xD;
      So far it is known that stress leads to an activation of the stress hormone axis followed by&#xD;
      an increased release of the stress hormone and glucocorticoid cortisol. Glucocorticoids bind&#xD;
      to glucocorticoid receptors that initiate a cellular signal cascade. However, it can be&#xD;
      assumed that other factors are involved but a profound understanding of the stress response&#xD;
      at the molecular level has not yet been performed yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a so-called &quot;multi-omics approach&quot; it is possible to determine changes in a large&#xD;
      number of molecular groups, such as proteins or lipids to research the underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      of diseases. While multi-omics analyzes have already helped gain elementary knowledge in a&#xD;
      large number of somatic diseases, the molecular effects of acute stress have not been&#xD;
      addressed yet. This will be the primary focus of this study. To achieve this an acute,&#xD;
      concise stress reaction closely resembling a genuine stress response is desired. In previous&#xD;
      studies, it was shown that bungee jumping triggers such a short, intense stress reaction and&#xD;
      the corresponding activation of the stress hormone axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this a cohort of 25-30 healthy male individuals who undergo a bungee jump&#xD;
      resembling an acute stress event will be compared to a cohort of 10-20 healthy males who&#xD;
      undergo the same experimental design without undertaking a bungee jump or other stress&#xD;
      intervention. At different time points (baseline, shortly before and after the intervention,&#xD;
      at multiple time points during the intervention as well as around one week follow up after&#xD;
      the intervention) serval psychometrical questionnaires will be gathered and blood will be&#xD;
      collected. A dexamethasone inhibition test will be performed before the stress intervention.&#xD;
      Sleep quality will be additionally assessed during the entire course of the study by&#xD;
      actigraphy. On selected days blood will be collected. Following, autophagy activity will be&#xD;
      assessed by Western Blot analysis, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, phosphoproteomics,&#xD;
      metabolomics, and lipidomics will be performed. Bioinformatic analysis, statistical&#xD;
      evaluation, quality control, and in silico pathway analyses will then specifically identify&#xD;
      factors and cascades of relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to analyze the clinical effects of an acute stress event in&#xD;
      correlation to the underlying, multi-level molecular profiling. Longitudinal multi-omic&#xD;
      profiling including proteome, metabolome, lipidome, and epigenetic changes will reveal&#xD;
      time-series analysis of thousands of molecular changes and an orchestrated composition of&#xD;
      autophagy depended signaling. The resulting findings will advance the role of autophagy in&#xD;
      the development of psychiatric disorders, and possibly investigate alternative treatment&#xD;
      venues on a molecular level, and finally contribute to a better clinical outcome.&#xD;
