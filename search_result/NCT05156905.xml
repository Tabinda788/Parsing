  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of cirmtuzumab in combination&#xD;
      with standard of care docetaxel in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Docetaxel is a taxane chemotherapy which has been shown to prolong survival in men&#xD;
      with castration resistant prostate cancer. Cirmtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets&#xD;
      the receptor called ROR1 of the non-canonical Wnt pathway and is suspected to contribute to&#xD;
      prostate cancer growth and progression.&#xD;
