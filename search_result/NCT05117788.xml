      Evidence of the clinical diagnostic accuracy and operational characteristics of the Bioneer&#xD;
      Accupower Q-RFIA PCR kit on IRON qPCR is needed to comprehensively evaluate Bioneer RFIA&#xD;
      validity and inform global and national policy decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of M/XDR-TB is essential to prevent significant&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and further transmission of disease. The FQ are key components of the&#xD;
      new bedaquiline-containing 6-9 month regimen, and so it is necessary to rule-out resistance&#xD;
      to these compounds prior to treating patients with the shorter regimen. Currently there are&#xD;
      no WHO endorsed tests that can identify resistance to both first and second-line drugs in one&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;

      Title Phase II: Multicentre Clinical Study to Assess the Performance of the Bioneer Accupower&#xD;
      Q-RFIA PCR kit on IRON qPCR for INH-, RIF-, FQ- and AG-Resistance Detection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale Evidence of the clinical diagnostic accuracy and operational&#xD;
      characteristics of the Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA PCR kit on IRON qPCR is needed to&#xD;
      comprehensively evaluate Bioneer RFIA validity and inform global and national policy&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA assay. The Investigational Use Only (IUO) product is intended&#xD;
      for the detection of MTB and mutations associated with RIF, INH, FQ and AMG drug resistance.&#xD;
      The assay which is run as a kit cartridge physically consists of two parts; a nucleic&#xD;
      extraction body part and the PCR plate. The cartridge is intended to be used with the IRON&#xD;
      qPCR system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IRON qPCR system provided for this study should only be used for testing IUO product and&#xD;
      study samples. The IRON qPCR instrument developed by Bioneer is intended to be used at lower&#xD;
      healthcare systems. The instrument has a small footprint ((30.5(W) x 27(D) x 39.5(H) cm),&#xD;
      weight (&lt; 15 kg) and can be operated on a battery charge. The system has the capability to&#xD;
      fully automate the detection of 40 targets and to provide sample-to-result within 30&#xD;
      minutes.) The investigational product will be strictly accounted for, including receipt and&#xD;
      inventory, storage, use during the trial, and return or disposal, as detailed in the Study&#xD;
      Manual for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other diagnostic tests (2nd comparators and reference tests) provided for use in this Trial&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Xpert MTB/XDR assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hain MTBDRplus assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hain MTBDRsl assay Instructions for use of the investigational product(s) are provided&#xD;
           in the IP package inserts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA assay detects Mtb and mutations associated with INH, RIF, FQ and&#xD;
      aminoglycoside resistance direct from sputum. In line with this intended use, clinical&#xD;
      samples will be directly tested by the Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA assay. However, the assay&#xD;
      will also be used to test the culture isolate. This additional Bioneer Accupower RFIA assay&#xD;
      testing will allow for a comparison of performance and non-determinant rates between testing&#xD;
      directly from the sample and testing from the culture isolate. It will also support&#xD;
      resolution of potential discordant LPA and NGS results from the initial Bioneer Accupower&#xD;
      Q-RFIA test result, as these tests will also be performed from the culture isolate&#xD;
      (discordance may arise as a result of infections with a mix of different strains, with only&#xD;
      one strain being grown out in culture). Furthermore, as all assays will be performed on the&#xD;
      same culture, there is also no risk of any assay being tested on a different quality sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to efficiently assess the diagnostic performance of the Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA PCR&#xD;
      kit on IRON qPCR, participants will be asked to provide ≥3ml of sputum (either a single&#xD;
      sputum or two consecutively collected and pooled sputa). Spot sputa should be pooled and&#xD;
      homogenized. For samples where only one specimen was collected from the participant, the&#xD;
      sample needs to be homogenized. Briefly, following a mechanical homogenisation step the&#xD;
      sputum sample will be split and the following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescence smear microscopy (FM smear)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Xpert MTB/XDR assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liquefaction/decontamination by NALC-NaOH followed by re-suspension on PBS and&#xD;
           inoculation on MGIT and Löwenstein-Jensen culture media&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MTB complex confirmation of positive cultures by either MPT64/MPB64 antigen&#xD;
                detection or PCR (GenoType) from each positive culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phenotypic DST to test INH, RIF, fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin and levofloxacin),&#xD;
                AMK, and KAN resistance will be done on the first culture positive for MTB complex&#xD;
                per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Molecular testing from all MTB-complex confirmed cultures using GenoType MTBDRplus&#xD;
                and MTBDRsl&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Whole genome sequencing will only be done from samples where the Bioneer result&#xD;
                (from either the sputum or culture testing) is discordant with phenotypic DST&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA from all MTBC confirmed cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All diagnostic test results (smear, Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA on direct sample, Xpert MTB/RIF&#xD;
      Ultra on direct sample, Xpert MTB/XDR on direct sample, MGIT, LJ, Bioneer Accupower RFIA on&#xD;
      culture isolate, MTBDRplus, MTBDRsl, and phenotypic DST results) will be recorded by the&#xD;
      laboratory technicians for each site on the laboratory CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective specimens selected from different biobanks will be processed as specified in&#xD;
      Figure 2. In the event where routine testing has already been done on the retrospective&#xD;
      specimens, FM smear and Xpert MTB/RIF or Ultra does not have to be repeated. Prior to the&#xD;
      study start the FIND study manager will evaluate the diagnostic data linked to each specimen&#xD;
      to determine which testing needs to be done or repeated for each site. Xpert MTB/XDR test&#xD;
      will be performed for every selected specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference Standard Test and Index Test Procedures Culture (LJ and MGIT), phenotypic DST and&#xD;
      smear microscopy will be performed at the testing sites based on local SOPs. Whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing will be done at a central location following a standardised protocol to be&#xD;
      provided by FIND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participating laboratory will undergo a remote laboratory evaluation to assess the&#xD;
      quality management system of the laboratory and more specifically to ensure standardized and&#xD;
      high-quality performance of routine tests including smear, culture and DST. Results from&#xD;
      reference standard testing will be recorded by technicians blinded to index test results,&#xD;
      eliminating the risk of review bias. Presence of MTB complex will be confirmed for all&#xD;
      patients from a positive culture using an MPT64-based rapid test or WHO-approved NAAT on the&#xD;
      culture isolate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A culture reference standard may be imperfect in paucibacillary (smear-negative) TB. This can&#xD;
      lead to bias in the accuracy estimates of the index test: (i) sensitivity may be&#xD;
      overestimated when index test and reference standard both yield negative results in a patient&#xD;
      with TB; and (ii) specificity may be underestimated when the index test gives a positive&#xD;
      result in a patient with TB who tests negative with the reference standard. A biased&#xD;
      sensitivity estimate is acceptable as it still represents a meaningful parameter (the&#xD;
      proportion of culture-positive TB that is also detected by the index test). However, since&#xD;
      near-perfect specificity is usually required of TB assays, bias in specificity can be&#xD;
      problematic. To mitigate the risk of spurious index test &quot;false-positive&quot; results, a total of&#xD;
      two cultures (one MGIT and one LJ culture) will be done in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A composite reference standard of phenotypic DST and NGS will be used for resistance&#xD;
      detection to ensure high confidence in the reference standard for this study. Using&#xD;
      phenotypic DST as a reference standard may be imperfect for mutations with minimum inhibitory&#xD;
      concentrations around the breakpoint of the respective drug. This can lead to bias in the&#xD;
      accuracy estimates of the index test where (i) sensitivity may be overestimated when index&#xD;
      test and reference standard both yield negative results for resistance; and (ii) specificity&#xD;
      may be underestimated when the index test gives a positive result for resistance where&#xD;
      phenotypic DST gives a negative result. To mitigate this risk sequencing will be done for all&#xD;
      samples with a discrepant result between the index assay and phenotypic DST. As part of this&#xD;
      study, sequencing results will only be available for results that are discordant between the&#xD;
      index assay and pDST. Using sequencing only for discrepant samples can also lead to bias in&#xD;
      the accuracy estimates for the index assay for cases where both the index and phenotypic DST&#xD;
      results are negative for resistance and where sequencing would have shown the presence of a&#xD;
      mutation. This risk is however minimal as clinically resistant mutations with a susceptible&#xD;
      phenotype result is rare and their genotypic basis not well understood. In such cases the&#xD;
      phenotypic DST result is still considered as the gold standard. Therefore, we considered use&#xD;
      of the composite reference standard the approach with the lowest risk of bias overall and&#xD;
      will use this for the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotypic MGIT DST will be done on the culture isolate for each clinical sample. MGIT DST&#xD;
      will be done on site to determine culture drug-susceptibility to INH, RIF, moxifloxacin,&#xD;
      levofloxacin, AMK, and KAN at the revised WHO critical concentrations15. Whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing will be done for samples where the Bioneer assay result (from either the sputum or&#xD;
      culture testing) is discordant with phenotypic DST. Whole genome sequencing will be done on&#xD;
      DNA extracted from the cultured sample. The output for both phenotypic DST and NGS results&#xD;
      are automated, and require no manual operator interpretation. Testing results, when obtained,&#xD;
      will be input onto the laboratory CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The index test will be performed on both the direct clinical sample as well as the positive&#xD;
      culture, to ensure high Bioneer Accupower RFIA diagnostic performance direct from sputum and&#xD;
      to provide a basis for comparison if any discordants are seen between the initial Bioneer&#xD;
      Accupower RFIA result and the phenotypic DST and additional molecular test results (NGS and&#xD;
      LPA). The output for the Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA PCR kit on IRON qPCR is automated and does&#xD;
      not require manual interpretation. As with the reference test, all Bioneer Accupower RFIA&#xD;
      test results will be noted on the laboratory CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCP statement This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki, ICH-GCP, ISO 13485: 2016 (if applicable) as well as all national legal and&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
