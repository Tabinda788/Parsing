    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is one of the most effective treatments for pelvic malignancies. About 35~61% of&#xD;
      the patients with pelvic cancer receive pelvic radiotherapy. Although radiotherapy&#xD;
      significantly prolongs the survival time of the patients, it induces an injury to the normal&#xD;
      tissues that may damage the pelvic and abdominal organs, with rectal damage as the most&#xD;
      common and persistent adverse effect. Radiation proctitis refers to the rectal damage as a&#xD;
      result of radiotherapy for the treatment of pelvic cancer such as cervical cancer,&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, and bladder cancer.&#xD;
      According to the time of onset and changing course of the disease, it can be divided into&#xD;
      acute radiation-induced proctitis (ARP) and chronic radiation-induced proctitis (CRP),&#xD;
      usually taking three months as a threshold. More than 75% of the patients receiving pelvic&#xD;
      radiotherapy develop ARP, and 5%-20% of the patients develop CRP. In fact, the incidence of&#xD;
      CRP is highly likely to be underestimated, since not every patient with symptoms goes for a&#xD;
      clinical intervention. Studies have shown that 81% of the patients receiving pelvic&#xD;
      radiotherapy developed gastrointestinal symptoms, but only 55% consulted the healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. Approximately 90 % of the CRP patients exhibited permanent bowel habit&#xD;
      changes, and 50% of the patients developed various gastrointestinal symptoms affecting their&#xD;
      quality of life. Radiation enteritis seriously affects the treatment process of the patients,&#xD;
      worsens the prognosis, and impairs the quality of life. The current common treatments for&#xD;
      radiation enteritis are psychological intervention, anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics,&#xD;
      probiotics to rebalance the gut microbiome, antioxidants, antidiarrheal agents, and surgical&#xD;
      treatment, if necessary. However, the overall treatment effect does not yield satisfactory&#xD;
      results. It is particularly important to find safe and effective preventive and treatment&#xD;
      measures for the radiation enteritis to improve the prognosis of patients, and improve the&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free radicals produced by the indirect action of ionizing radiation are considered to be one&#xD;
      of the main causes of radiation enteritis. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), also known as&#xD;
      Sapropterin, is an important cofactor of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme. Under normal&#xD;
      physiological conditions, guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) is the key enzyme&#xD;
      for the synthesis of BH4. Reduction in GCH1 activity lowers the production of BH4, causes NOS&#xD;
      uncoupling, and leads to an elevated level of oxygen free radicals (reactive oxygen species,&#xD;
      ROS). Studies have shown that GCH1 over expression can restore BH4 level and NO products in&#xD;
      irradiated skin cells, reverse and inhibit the NOS uncoupling caused by ionizing radiation,&#xD;
      thereby eliminating the ionizing radiation-induced ROS, reducing DNA damage, and postponing&#xD;
      the cell apoptosis and cell aging. In animal experiments, BH4 administration significantly&#xD;
      reduced the occurrence of acute radiation enteritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This present study envisaged a single-center, prospective, open-label, placebo and randomized&#xD;
      controlled phase II clinical study. The research subjects included the patients, who received&#xD;
      radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and patients who needed supplementary radiotherapy due&#xD;
      to prognostic risk factors for treating pathologically diagnosed gynecological malignancies&#xD;
      (including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and vulvar cancer), with no pathological type&#xD;
      restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled cases were randomly divided into three groups ina ratio of 1:1:1. The placebo&#xD;
      group was administered a vitamin tablet (Centrum) orally, once a day. The two experimental&#xD;
      groups were administered BH4 orally, with a dose of 100 mg, once per day, and a dose of 100&#xD;
      mg, three times a day (morning, noon, and evening). The oral administration of pills was&#xD;
      started on the same day of the first radiation treatment, and ended three months after the&#xD;
      treatment ended. The degree of injury of the radiation enteritis among the patients was&#xD;
      evaluated weekly after the treatment started. It was evaluated one month and three months&#xD;
      after the end of treatment, once per three months for two years and once per six months&#xD;
      between 2~5 years after the treatment ended. The degree of ARP and CRP was evaluated&#xD;
      according to the radiation morbidity scoring criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group&#xD;
      (RTOG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was adopted, using the conventional split&#xD;
      mode,(1.8~2.0) Gy/day, 5 times/week.The pelvic clinical target volume (CTV)&#xD;
      was(45~50.4)Gy/25~28 times, and the boost for local lymph nodes metastasis was raised to&#xD;
      (60~70) Gy. Patients with indications for brachytherapy were treated with brachytherapy&#xD;
      following the International Commission on Radiation Units &amp; Measurements (ICRU) Report No.&#xD;
      89. The radical therapy treated or postoperative high-risk patients receiveda concurrent&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy, usingunrestricted chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
