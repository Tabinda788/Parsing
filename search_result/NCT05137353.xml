  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study, we wish to test how effective/ beneficial music activities can be for&#xD;
      children with dyslexia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that music in the form of training (i.e., intervention) is able to&#xD;
      facilitate linguistic processes (e.g., phonological encoding/decoding, categorical&#xD;
      perception) and cognitive functions (e.g., working memory) in children that have dyslexia or&#xD;
      reading difficulties. In addition to this, music trainings with a focus on entrainment can&#xD;
      improve phonological as well as reading skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the above, we have designed and developed a music training programme. This&#xD;
      programme, which is called RitMoZ Training (i.e., from Ritmus és Mozgás és Zene: meaning&#xD;
      Rhythm and Movement and Music in Hungarian language), is designed for (Hungarian) children&#xD;
      who have dyslexia or reading difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the efficacy of the music training, we are going to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial which consists of a pre-training phase, a training phase and a post-training&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Music Training (RitMoZ Training)</intervention_name>
    <description>This training is inspired by intervention concepts followed in SUVAG Polyclinic in Zagreb, Croatia and Kodaly pedagogy in Hungary. RitMoZ Training programme consists of 6 main activities: matching activity, nursery rhymes, rhythmic stimulations, music shapes, music writing and music reading. The training focuses on the perceptual overlap between language and music, embodiment and entrainment. The aim of the training is to improve characteristic features of reading disorders such as phonological awareness, perception of rhythm, phonological working memory and perception of speech sounds.</description>
