  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a frequent problem in post-stroke patients. It can negatively affect the&#xD;
      functional recovery of patients and impair their quality of life. The repetitive pulsed&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rPMS) treatment has been shown to cause a reduction in muscle tone and&#xD;
      improvement in activities of daily living in stroke patients. So far, the effects of rPMS on&#xD;
      muscle tone, which is the neurophysiological component of spasticity, have been evaluated,&#xD;
      but its effects on the biomechanical component (soft tissue stiffness) have not been&#xD;
      demonstrated. In this study, the effects of rPMS on soft tissue stiffness as well as&#xD;
      increased muscle tone will be evaluated with clinical and ultrasound elastography in&#xD;
      post-stroke patients with upper extremity spasticity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. Pos-stroke patients who&#xD;
      applied to the Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation and developed upper extremity spasticity will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be randomized into two groups; treatment group and sham&#xD;
      group. The block randomization will be preferred using the Random Allocation Software (RAS).&#xD;
      10 sessions of stretching exercises will be applied to all patients once a day, five sessions&#xD;
      a week, with each session lasting 20 minutes. Patients in the treatment group will receive an&#xD;
      additional peripheral magnetic stimulation therapy for the upper extremity arm/forearm&#xD;
      spastic muscles on the hemiplegic side for a total of 10 sessions once a day, five sessions a&#xD;
      week, for two weeks, each session lasting ten minutes. The patient will be seated in a chair.&#xD;
      rPMS will not be given to the sham group, the device will not be operated, the probe of the&#xD;
      device will be positioned in the same way as the patients in the treatment group for ten&#xD;
      minutes, and the sounds recorded during the operation of the device will be heard by the&#xD;
      patients. The patients and evaluators will not know which group the patients are in. rPMS&#xD;
      treatment will be applied with the &quot;BTL-6000 Super Inductive System Elite&quot; in compliance with&#xD;
      the recommendation by the manufacturer. The rPMS treatment parameters will be adjusted to use&#xD;
      stimulus intensity above the motor threshold which is determined individually for each&#xD;
      patient. Duration of each session will be 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic data such as gender, age, education level, occupation, background, duration&#xD;
      of stroke, type of lesion, history of comorbidities and drugs used for spasticity including&#xD;
      the botulinum toxin injection will be recorded. The patients will be evaluated three times;&#xD;
      at the beginning, after the treatment (week 2) and two weeks after the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated with the Fugl - Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Rating Scale, Modified&#xD;
      Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Modified Tardieu Scale. Measurement of tissue stiffness will be made&#xD;
      by shear wave elastography technique on the spastic upper extremity forearm/wrist flexor&#xD;
      muscles of the affected side. Measurements will be made with the Siemens ACUSON S2000&#xD;
      Ultrasound System in kilopascals (kPa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Modified Ashworth Scale is considered the primary clinical measure of muscle spasticity.&#xD;
      Hence it will be used as the primary outcome variable. Patients with severe spasticity (MAS&#xD;
      stage 4) will not be included in the study. One unit decrease in MAS will be considered as&#xD;
      clinically significant. Accordingly a power analysis yielded a sample size of 68 volunteers&#xD;
      with 80% power and 5% margin of error. However, due to the nature of the study, it was&#xD;
      planned to include a total of 76 volunteers, with an expected loss of 10%.&#xD;
