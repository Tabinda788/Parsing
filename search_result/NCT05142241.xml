  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial tests whether talazoparib and temozolomide works to shrink tumors in&#xD;
      patients with rare cancer that have spread to other places in the body (advanced).&#xD;
      Talazoparib is an inhibitor of poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme&#xD;
      that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help&#xD;
      keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are&#xD;
      a type of targeted therapy. Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving talazoparib and temozolomide may help&#xD;
      stop rare cancer from growing or shrink.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with advanced rare cancers who have objective&#xD;
      responses (OR) to treatment with temozolomide and talazoparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months on study&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify genomic and transcriptomic determinants of response and resistance in tumor&#xD;
      biopsy specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA)&#xD;
      and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that may be associated with response or resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination on biomarkers of cell death&#xD;
      and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tumor tissue and CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO QD&#xD;
      on days 2-6. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The threshold creatinine values in this table were derived from the Schwartz&#xD;
                  formula for estimating glomerular giltration rate (GFR), utilizing child length&#xD;
                  and stature data published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Talazoparib and temozolomide can cause fetal harm based on animal reproductive and&#xD;
             genetic toxicity studies. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for&#xD;
             at least 7 months after dosing with study drugs ceases. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 7 months after completion of study drug&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsies are optional on this study. In lieu of baseline biopsies, patients are&#xD;
             encouraged to submit at registration archival tumor biopsy tissue from a previous&#xD;
             research study or medical care providing it meets the minimum collection and&#xD;
             preservations requirements. Criteria for the submission of archival tissue are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tissue must have been collected within 3 months prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must not have received any intervening therapy for their cancer since the&#xD;
                  collection of the tumor sample&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial. For&#xD;
             these patients, an HIV viral load test must be completed within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensory/motor neuropathy &gt;= grade 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial. Patients with treated brain metastases, whose brain metastatic&#xD;
             disease has remained stable for &gt;= 1 month without requiring steroid and anti-seizure&#xD;
             medication are eligible to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition&#xD;
             to study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known clinically significant liver disease, including active viral, alcoholic, or&#xD;
             other hepatitis; cirrhosis; fatty liver; and inherited liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with past or resolved hepatitis B infection (defined as having a&#xD;
                  negative hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test and a positive anti-HBc&#xD;
                  [antibody to hepatitis B core antigen] antibody test) are eligible. For these&#xD;
                  patients, HBsAg and anti-HBc tests must be done within 28 days prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;
                  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). For&#xD;
                  these patients, an HCV RNA test must be done within 28 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious untreated&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic respiratory failure/congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because temozolomide and talazoparib have&#xD;
             demonstrated fetal harm in animal reproductive studies. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment&#xD;
             period and for 1 months following the last dose of study drug&#xD;
