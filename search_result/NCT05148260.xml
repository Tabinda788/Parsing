  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By 2030, depression will be the worldwide leading disease burden with women more predisposed&#xD;
      to postnatal depression due to childbirth and parenting, which can lead to long-term&#xD;
      consequences for the child. The uptake of mental health services by British mothers of&#xD;
      African/Caribbean origin is low due to a lack of access to culturally appropriate care. The&#xD;
      ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has exponentially increased postnatal depression.&#xD;
      However, this project aims to test the acceptability and cultural appropriateness of the&#xD;
      proposed intervention using pilot trials to treat postnatal depression and improve child&#xD;
      wellbeing in British African/Caribbean mothers and children. It is anticipated that findings&#xD;
      will facilitate scale-up as the intervention is evidence-based, ecologically friendly,&#xD;
      manualised and can be delivered by non-mental health specialists such as trained&#xD;
      community-health-workers, and thus, helps to address the workforce shortage.&#xD;

    <description>Learning Through Play (LTP): Underpinned by Piaget's theory of cognitive development (Piaget, 1952) and Bowlby's theory of attachment (Bowlby, 1980), the central feature of the LTP component of the intervention is a pictorial calendar devised for parents, depicting eight successive stages of child development from birth to 3 years, with illustrations of parent-child play and other activities that promote parental involvement, learning, and mother-child attachment.&#xD;
Culturally adapted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CaCBT): CaCBT is well-grounded in the standard framework of cognitive-behavioural theory (Bernal et al., 2009) and uses techniques of active listening, changing negative thinking, guided discovery.</description>
