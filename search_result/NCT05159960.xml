  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a common eye disease that can lead to blindness. The only known way to reduce the&#xD;
      rate of disease progression is by reducing the pressure in the eye (the intraocular pressure,&#xD;
      IOP). Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is an ophthalmic laser intervention with the&#xD;
      purpose of reducing the IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLT can be performed in different ways, with four of the treatment protocols being evaluated&#xD;
      in the Optimal SLT (OSLT) trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLT is a repeatable procedure, but scientific evidence is scarce regarding more than one&#xD;
      repetition. In this trial, patients included in the OSLT trial will be invited to the&#xD;
      extended trial (OSLT-R), for further follow-up and re-treatment with SLT, if needed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects already included in the OSLT trial (NCT03798223) will be invited to the extended&#xD;
      trial (OSLT-R) when OSLT follow up is scheduled to terminate. Patients are re-treated as&#xD;
      needed, according to the randomized group assignment performed in the OSLT inclusion process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient is followed until the last of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 years after OSLT inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  31 December 2024 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six months after the last SLT was performed, during the above time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OSLT-R trial is aiming to elucidate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the SLT efficacy, in terms of relative IOP reduction (percent of baseline IOP),&#xD;
           changes with additional SLT iterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the longevity of IOP reduction after SLT changes with additional SLT iterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If repeated SLT is associated with a change in the frequency and severity of&#xD;
           postoperative discomfort or adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the above will be analyzed within each of the four treatment groups (SLT protocols) in&#xD;
      the trial. Further, analysis will also be conducted regarding differences between the&#xD;
      treatment groups regarding the above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, analysis will be performed regarding SLT efficacy depending of the total number of&#xD;
      SLT:s an eye has received, including those performed before entering the OSLT and OSLT-R&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
