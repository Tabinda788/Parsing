      This study is a multi-center, open labeled, single, -combined, with multiple dose escalation&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase; Dose escalation phase:&#xD;
      based on the earlier studies, 3 more patients will be added to the 180mg/m2 dose group. The&#xD;
      follow-up dose group will adopt the &quot;3+3&quot; design, with 3-6 subjects in each group; include 3&#xD;
      preset dose levels, 220mg/m2, 260mg/m2 and 300mg/m2, respectively. Each subject will receive&#xD;
      only one corresponding dose. After the completion of single dose and 21-day DLT observation&#xD;
      period, Safety is assessed by the investigator and sponsor, and if the safety evaluation&#xD;
      results is favorable, subject will continue to receive the same level of testing compound.&#xD;
      Each patient will receive maximum of 4 cycle of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion stage: according to the results of the dose increasing stage, dose groups will&#xD;
      be selected for expansion. It is expected that 2 to 3 dose groups will enter the expansion&#xD;
      stage, and the total number of participants in each dose group will be 20, and a total of 4&#xD;
      cycles of drug administration will be given to each subject.&#xD;
