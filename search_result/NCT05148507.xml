      The purpose of the study is to assess whether PROKERA can sufficiently stabilize the ocular&#xD;
      surface prior to cataract surgery and improve post operative outcomes patients with moderate&#xD;
      to severe dry disease.&#xD;

      Amniotic membrane has been used to treat many ocular diseases and repair ocular surface&#xD;
      damage. PROKERA contains amniotic membrane fastened between a ring system and can be worn in&#xD;
      the eye like a contact lens. PROKERA is a medical device that was cleared by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cataract surgery is the most common eye surgery done in the United States. Prior to cataract&#xD;
      surgery, machines scan the eyes to calculate which implant is needed at the time of cataract&#xD;
      surgery. When a patient has dry eyes, the machines may have inaccurate measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether PROKERA can sufficiently stabilize the ocular&#xD;
      surface prior to cataract surgery and improve post operative outcomes patients with moderate&#xD;
      to severe dry disease. There will be a maximum of 64 eyes of individuals age 18 and older in&#xD;
      the study enrolled at one study site. Each subject will have both eyes evaluated for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to cataract surgery, patients enrolled in the study will have The pro Cara device&#xD;
      inserted on the surface of the eye. The subject will then come back after about five days to&#xD;
      remove the PROKERA device and follow up again in one week and two weeks after the removal of&#xD;
      the PROKERA device. During both of the follow up visits, the study doctor will grade your&#xD;
      symptoms based on a questionnaire, examine your eyes, take pictures, and grade the severity&#xD;
      of the dry eye disease to determine any changes from the baseline testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your two week visit, you will schedule your cataract surgery, which will be within one to&#xD;
      two weeks time. If you continue to have dry eye disease after her PROKERA device removal, and&#xD;
      your study doctor determines you are not eligible for cataract surgery, you will have another&#xD;
      PROKERA device inserted. If you fail two treatments of PROKERA device, you will be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you undergo surgery, you will need to return for one last follow up visit at one month&#xD;
      postoperatively, where you will undergo the same examination procedures as the previous&#xD;
      follow up visits.&#xD;
