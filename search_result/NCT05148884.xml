      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study evaluating the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of up to 2 mg/day (1 mg BID) of NLX-112 versus placebo&#xD;
      in patients with moderate to severe L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD). NLX-112 will be up-titrated to either 2 mg/day or to the highest well-tolerated dose&#xD;
      less than 2 mg/day over 4 weeks, maintained at the well-tolerated dose for an additional 2&#xD;

      This is a two-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study evaluating the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of up to 2 mg/day of NLX 112 versus placebo in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
      NLX-112 will be up-titrated to either 2 mg/day (1 mg BID) or to the highest well-tolerated&#xD;
      dose less than 2 mg/day over 4 weeks, maintained at the well-tolerated dose for an additional&#xD;
      2 weeks, and then down-titrated over 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will report to the study clinic for a screening visit (Visit 1), followed by a&#xD;
      baseline visit on Day 1 (Visit 2) where patients will be randomized and begin treatment. Two&#xD;
      remote safety visits over telephone (Days 7 and 49 [Visit 3 and Visit 8]) will be conducted.&#xD;
      Once treatment has commenced, there will be 2 in-person safety visits to the clinic (Days 14&#xD;
      and 21 [Visit 4 and Visit 5]), 2 in-person efficacy visits to the clinic (Days 28 and 42&#xD;
      [Visit 6 and Visit 7]) and one follow-up in person final safety visit (Day 70 [Visit 9]). In&#xD;
      total, patients will report to the clinic for 7 in-person visits. Patients entering the study&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (16:8 patients) to receive either NLX 112 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visits 2, 6 and 7, efficacy assessments will start 30 minutes after the patient has taken&#xD;
      150% of his or her regular L-DOPA dose, when the patient is ON and experiencing typical&#xD;
      dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A PD Home Dyskinesia Diary (electronic) will be completed by the patients and/or caregiver&#xD;
      with concordance in ON time with dyskinesia between study staff and patient. Four consecutive&#xD;
      24-hour diaries will be completed prior to randomization (baseline, Visit 2) and prior to the&#xD;
      clinic visits on Days 28 and 42 (Visits 6 and 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wearable dyskinesia assessment device will be used to monitor dyskinesias during a 4-day&#xD;
      period prior to the baseline visit (Day 1, Visit 2) and a 4-day period prior to the clinic&#xD;
      visits on Days 28 and 42 (Visits 6 and 7, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected for possible NLX-112 plasma concentration measurements on Days 14,&#xD;
      21, 28, 42 and 70 (Visits 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9).&#xD;
