  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of sexual violence are particularly vulnerable to develop psychological as well as&#xD;
      physical health problems, Burundian children and adolescents being at elevated risk.&#xD;
      Psychosocial care, and trauma-focused interventions, nevertheless, are near absent in&#xD;
      Burundi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to ameliorate psychosocial care for survivors of sexual&#xD;
      violence in strengthening health care competencies by implementing evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention strategies. We intend to develop an approach identifying particularly vulnerable&#xD;
      children and adolescents and testing a preventive family-oriented psychotherapeutic approach.&#xD;
      The latter aims at reducing stigmatization and at promoting the processing of the event&#xD;
      within families. The project involves two cohorts, which are assessed enrolling them in the&#xD;
      study, during a three-months and a 12-months follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of sexual violence are particularly vulnerable to develop psychological as well as&#xD;
      physical health problems, children and adolescents being at particular risk. Residing in&#xD;
      conflict zones with disrupted community structures and social norms, substantially increases&#xD;
      the risk for interpersonal violence, especially sexual abuse. The post-war country Burundi&#xD;
      shows high prevalence rates for childhood sexual abuse. Adequate psychosocial care and&#xD;
      trauma-focused interventions, however, are near absent, especially in rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, talking about sexual activities remains a taboo-topic in Burundi, and&#xD;
      particularly talking about sexual abuse. Survivors often suffer from stigmatization and&#xD;
      therefore conceal their abusive experience. Recent studies, however, accentuate the&#xD;
      importance of social support, notably parental acceptance, in the aftermath of sexual abuse.&#xD;
      Parental acceptance shows buffering effects of sequelae following sexual abuse. Conversely,&#xD;
      parental rejection, especially coming from the father, lowers the self-esteem and leads to&#xD;
      emotional unresponsiveness and negative self-cognitions. Rejection thus risks to exacerbate&#xD;
      feelings of shame and the internalization of stigma. Hence, the implementation of&#xD;
      family-oriented interventions is crucial for effective treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is thus to ameliorate psychosocial care for survivors of sexual&#xD;
      violence in strengthening health care competencies by implementing evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention strategies. Combining insights from the aforementioned research, cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural strategies, and cultural aspects we developed a preventive treatment approach&#xD;
      aiming to address (1) the building block effect using trauma-therapeutic methods, (2) social&#xD;
      exclusion by family members and society, and (3) communication about the incident and&#xD;
      associated emotions within the family. The intervention consisted of three sessions. The&#xD;
      first cohort included in the study does not receive the intervention in order to establish a&#xD;
      baseline assessment of the course of mental health symptoms in the aftermath of sexual&#xD;
      violence, and to help identify those in need of psychosocial assistance. The second cohort is&#xD;
      offered the family intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments are planned at 3 and 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group receives treatment as usual in the first aid center for survivors of sexual abuse. This includes medical and judicial assistance if necessary. Furthermore, they receive the psychological family focused intervention.&#xD;
The intervention consists of a total of three sessions with the aim of reestablishing and validating the relationship between sexually abused children and their parents. The intervention focuses on psychoeducation regarding shame and other trauma related disorders. Further, the acknowledgement of shame and embarrassment as well as parental skills are intended to be improved.</description>

    <intervention_name>Preventive Narrative Exposure Therapy (PreNET) family intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Sessions: (1) Participants are invited to narrate the event in detail, in line with the protocol of the trauma-focused intervention NET. Furthermore, participants and caregiver(s) will receive a brief psychoeducation about expected symptoms and supportive behaviour in the aftermath of sexual violence.&#xD;
(2) Two weeks after session 1, the second session focuses on caregiver only and their emotions. The narration of the event is read to the caregiver(s). Caregiver(s) receive assistance regulating their emotions. They receive psychoeducation on how to support their child.&#xD;
(3) Two weeks after the second session, the children assisted by their caregivers lay a chronological lifeline of their most important life experiences. The chronology and the context of the traumatic events is reinforced. The narration of the sexual abuse is read again to the child and the caregiver(s). The caregiver(s) are encouraged to support emotionally their child during the renarration.</description>
