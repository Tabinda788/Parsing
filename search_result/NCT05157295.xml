  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome characterized by urinary urgency, with or without&#xD;
      urinary incontinence, nocturia, and urinary frequency. Intravesical injection of&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of&#xD;
      neurogenic and idiopathic OAB. Current standard of practice involves 100 U of&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA diluted in 10 ml saline cystoscopically injected into approximately 20&#xD;
      different detrusor muscle sites equally distributed along the posterior bladder wall and&#xD;
      dome. This treatment was classically done in the operating room under general anesthesia, but&#xD;
      now is typically performed in an office setting using local anesthesia (lidocaine) as this is&#xD;
      more feasible and tolerable. Patients can experience discomfort and pain with each injection.&#xD;
      Evidence has also shown that administering the same dose of onabotulinumtoxinA into fewer&#xD;
      injection sites in the detrusor muscle (ranging from 3 to 10) results in equivalent efficacy&#xD;
      compared to the current standard. However, it has yet to be determined if there is a&#xD;
      significant difference in patient satisfaction and tolerability when the procedure is&#xD;
      administered in an office setting using the same dosage with fewer injections. Our study aims&#xD;
      to assess whether patient tolerance and satisfaction of intravesicular onabotulinumtoxinA&#xD;
      increases with the use of 4 detrusor injections as opposed to 20 injections when performed in&#xD;
      an office setting on women with OAB.&#xD;

    <description>The Benefit, Satisfaction, and Willingness to Continue (BSW) questionnaire is a validated instrument administered by the physician. It asks participants if they had benefit, satisfaction, and a willingness to continue from a specific treatment. If yes, responses range from 1(little benefit, little, satisfaction, a little bit willing) to 2(much benefit, very satisfied, very willing).</description>

    <description>The Overactive Bladder questionnaire (OAB-q) short form is a validated instrument that measures the extent to which participants have various symptoms of OAB over the past 4 weeks. The responses range from 1(not at all) to 6(a very great deal).</description>
