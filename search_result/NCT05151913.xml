    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic Cholestasis in Pregnancy (ICP) is a disease that appears in the later stage of&#xD;
      pregnancy with itching (pruritus) and increased risk of fetal complications. It is the most&#xD;
      prevalent pregnancy-specific liver disease, affecting between 1 and 20 % of all pregnant&#xD;
      women, depending on ethnicity and geographic location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition is associated with an increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes, including&#xD;
      preterm labour and intrauterine death. Further, ICP is associated with an increased risk for&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia, thyroid disease, diabetes and cancer. ICP is typically present during the&#xD;
      third trimester, when the serum concentrations of progesterone and estrogens reach their&#xD;
      peak, and also, the time when the gut barrier has an increased permeability. In ICP subjects,&#xD;
      both altered progesterone and bile acid metabolism is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying etiology for ICP is unknown, but there are indications that the gut microbiota&#xD;
      may be involved. It has become increasingly clear that the gut microbiota is associated with&#xD;
      metabolic diseases and has an important function in metabolizing endogenous and dietary&#xD;
      metabolites. Bile acids are metabolized by the gut microbiota by deconjugation and production&#xD;
      of secondary metabolites, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) being one example of a secondary bile&#xD;
      acid produced by the microbiota. Bile acids are produced from cholesterol by a series of&#xD;
      hepatic enzymes generating cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in humans that&#xD;
      are conjugated to predominantly glycine. These primary bile acids are stored in the gall&#xD;
      bladder from where they are released upon a meal. The majority of conjugated bile acids are&#xD;
      reabsorbed from the ileum, but through the action of microbial bile salt hydrolase (BSH), the&#xD;
      bile acids escape reabsorption and enter the colon where they can be further metabolized.&#xD;
      Accordingly, bile acid deconjugation reduces enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids and&#xD;
      thereby reduces the total bile acid pool. Reduction of bile acid levels are crucial to reduce&#xD;
      pruritus and reduce fetal complication risks in ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to identify biomarkers in the microbiota associated with ICP and the onset of this&#xD;
      disease, or state of the disease, during pregnancy. Bacterial species that have a capability&#xD;
      for UDCA production and correlate with sulphated progesterone metabolites are of specific&#xD;
      interest. Furthermore, bacteria with sulphating and desulphating capabilities are also of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
