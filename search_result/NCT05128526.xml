  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pes planus is a common foot problem since childhood, which may include loss of height of the&#xD;
      medial longitudinal arch, which is the most important arch supporting the foot, valgus of the&#xD;
      hindfoot, and abduction of the midfoot relative to the hindfoot. Muscle shortness, increased&#xD;
      joint laxity with obesity, W-shaped sitting, male gender and genetic background are among the&#xD;
      factors that can increase the incidence and severity of pes planus in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. It has been shown in different studies that pes planus is carried into adulthood&#xD;
      at a rate of 4-23%. It is known that there is oxygen consumption from the body during muscle&#xD;
      contraction. For this reason, it has been shown in the literature that muscle oxygenation is&#xD;
      better and the performance of the individual is better in exercises combined with breathing&#xD;
      exercises in the exercise program. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized whether foot&#xD;
      shortening exercises combined with breathing would have an effect on muscular activation&#xD;
      during foot shortening exercises. It is seen that there is a limited number of studies in the&#xD;
      literature evaluating the effect of breathing exercises and combined foot exercises on the&#xD;
      activation of the muscles around the feet. For this reason, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the effect of combined respiratory foot shortening exercises on the muscular&#xD;
      activations of the foot circumference in individuals with flat feet. Two-way repeated&#xD;
      analyses of variance will use to determine the statistical significance of Abductor Hallucis&#xD;
      Longus, Tibialis Anterior, and Peroneus Longus electromyography activity. Participants: Ten&#xD;
      participants with pes planus.The participants will perform Short Foot Exercises with and&#xD;
      without respiratory exercises in sitting and standing positions. Main Outcome Measures:&#xD;
      Surface electromyography will use to measure the activity of the Abductor Hallucis Longus,&#xD;
      Tibialis anterior, Peroneus Longus. Respiratory exercises may be an effective method for&#xD;
      reducing compensatory Tibialis Anterior activity and increasing Abductor Hallucis Longus&#xD;
      muscle activity during Short Foot Exercises for individuals with pes planus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ten volunteer individuals with flat feet, studying at the Faculty of Health Sciences, will be&#xD;
      included in the study. The feet of the individuals who want to be included in the study will&#xD;
      be examined by the researchers with the Navicular drop test. Individuals' age, height,&#xD;
      weight, gender, shoe size will be questioned. Flat feet of individuals will be determined by&#xD;
      the Navicular Drop test. The navicular drop test is a test used to measure the amount of&#xD;
      pronation in the foot, which is obtained by subtracting the navicular height measured while&#xD;
      standing with weight on the foot, from the navicular height measured in the sitting position&#xD;
      without placing weight on the foot. While individuals are sitting on a chair with bare feet,&#xD;
      the navicular tubercle will be marked on both feet and marked at the level of the navicular&#xD;
      tubercle on a card on the floor. Afterward, the individual was asked to stand up, and the&#xD;
      navicular tubercle alignment would be re-marked on the same card while giving full weight to&#xD;
      the foot. The expression in mm of the distance between both lines will be recorded as the&#xD;
      amount of navicular drop. The amount of navicular drop between 6 and 9 mm will be considered&#xD;
      as normal Medial Longitudinal Arch, and if it is 10 mm or more, it will be considered as pes&#xD;
      planus. Individuals will be divided into two groups according to the Navicular drop test.&#xD;
      This research will consist of two groups, one group of individuals with flat feet and one&#xD;
      group of individuals without flat feet. In both groups, foot shortening exercises will be&#xD;
      applied in two different situations. The first case is the activation of the foot&#xD;
      circumference muscles during the foot shortening exercises, and the second situation is the&#xD;
      activation of the foot circumference muscles during the combination of the foot shortening&#xD;
      exercises with the breathing exercises. Foot shortening exercise, in this exercise that works&#xD;
      the small intrinsic muscles of the foot in isolation, the subjects will be asked to raise the&#xD;
      medial foot and hold it in this position for 5 seconds while sitting on the ground with the&#xD;
      feet in the subtalar neutral position, trying to bring the heel and fingers closer to each&#xD;
      other. During the movement, the fingers will be warned not to bend participants' fingers to&#xD;
      avoid a contraction in the long flexor muscles, while Participants will be asked to do 3&#xD;
      repetitions. After the individuals are given 5 minutes to rest the participants' feet,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to combine the same exercise with breathing exercises. When the&#xD;
      exercise is terminated, the situation will be returned to the start position. Muscular&#xD;
      activations of the Tibialis anterior, Abductor Hallucis, and Peroneus Longus muscles will be&#xD;
      measured with superficial kinesiological electromyography (EMG) device. The electrode sites&#xD;
      will be prepared for the EMG signal by shaving and cleaning the skin with cotton dipped in&#xD;
      alcohol to minimize output impedance and allow proper electrode bonding. Disposable Ag/AgCl&#xD;
      superficial electrodes will be placed approximately 2 cm apart in the direction of the muscle&#xD;
      fibers. Electrodes will be placed parallel to the muscle fibers at points recommended by&#xD;
      Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessments of Muscles (SENIAM). A detailed&#xD;
      description of the electrode placements is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG electrodes for Abductor Hallucis will be attached from the anterior edge of the medial&#xD;
      malleolus approximately 1-2 cm posterior to the navicular tuberosity, located just in front&#xD;
      of the vertical line. For the Tibialis Anterior, the electrodes will be placed in the area&#xD;
      corresponding to the one-third between the tip of the head of the fibula and the medial&#xD;
      malleolus. For the Peroneus Longus muscle, the electrodes will be placed at 25% of the&#xD;
      distance between the tip of the head of the fibula and the tip of the lateral malleolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure the maximum voluntary contraction values from the determined muscle&#xD;
      groups, separate EMG measurements will be performed with 3 repetitions of maximal contraction&#xD;
      of 5 seconds, with a resting period of 30 seconds between each of them. As a result of these&#xD;
      measurements, the average of these 3 repetitions performed at the maximum activation level&#xD;
      for each muscle of the individuals will be taken. Afterward, surface EMG measurements will be&#xD;
      taken from the same muscle groups for 10 seconds during the foot shortening exercises while&#xD;
      breathing and without breathing. According to the maximum voluntary contraction for each&#xD;
      muscle, the muscle activation rates will be determined during the foot shortening exercises&#xD;
      with and without breathing [activity muscle activation amount / Maximal voluntary contraction&#xD;
      * 100 (% Maximum voluntary contraction)]. The sampling rate of the EMG signal will be set to&#xD;
      1000 Hz. A 20 Hz Butterworth High-Pass filter will be applied to all EMG recordings and RMS&#xD;
      100 ms will be selected and filtered for smoothing. Measured data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Noraxon MyoResearch XP software (version 1.08; Noraxon Inc, Scottsdale, AZ).&#xD;
