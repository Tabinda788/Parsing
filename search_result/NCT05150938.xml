  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which patient data from the past on venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      (VTE) in patients with cancer is studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VTE is a condition in which a patient has problems due to the formation of blood clots in the&#xD;
      veins. Blood clots can reduce the flow of blood to vital organs such as the heart and lungs,&#xD;
      which can lead to them becoming damaged. VTE can also be &quot;recurrent&quot;. This means that the&#xD;
      blood clots have returned after treatment. People who have cancer have an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three main types of anticoagulation treatments (&quot;blood thinners&quot;) have been available for&#xD;
      patients with cancer who also have VTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) The treatment rivaroxaban belongs&#xD;
           to the NOACs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to other treatments available to patients who have cancer and VTE, NOACs may cause&#xD;
      fewer medical problems and can be easier for patients to take correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers will collect data about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the type of VTE treatments given and for how long the treatments are taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the risk of blood clots returning in the veins after treatment, any events of major&#xD;
           bleeding, and the number of deaths in patients with cancer who do not have a high risk&#xD;
           of bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will compare this information in the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  who received rivaroxaban to the patients who received LMWHs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  who received NOACs to the patients who received LMWHs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no required visits with a study doctor or required tests in this study. The&#xD;
      researchers will look at the health information from adult patients in Sweden who were&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer between 2013 and 2019 and also have VTE. The researchers will collect&#xD;
      this information from Swedish health registers including the Cancer Registry, National&#xD;
      Patient Registry, Prescribed Drug Registry, and Cause of Death Registry.&#xD;
