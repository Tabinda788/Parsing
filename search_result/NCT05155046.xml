      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is a highly effective treatment for localized prostate cancer; however,&#xD;
      recurrence is more common in patients with unfavorable intermediate and high-risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer, and is usually diagnosed by rising prostate specific antigen (PSA - biochemical&#xD;
      failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early identification of disease persistence or recurrence before meeting criteria of&#xD;
      biochemical failure may allow effective potentially curative salvage treatment, but&#xD;
      identification of local recurrence or persistence at early stages is challenging. CT imaging&#xD;
      is relatively insensitive at localizing recurrence, while MRI is more sensitive for local&#xD;
      recurrence but is non-specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted PET imaging was recently FDA approved for&#xD;
      imaging men with suspected prostate cancer metastases who are potentially curable by&#xD;
      radiation or surgery. PSMA based imaging has been used in prospective trials to define extent&#xD;
      of disease and to alter radiation treatment volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL, a second generation PSMA PET agent that binds with high affinity to PSMA yet&#xD;
      clears rapidly from the blood pool, has recently been approved by the FDA as a method to&#xD;
      stage high risk cancer and detect recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging response in participants with localized prostate cancer&#xD;
      after treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with or without androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy proven localized prostate cancer in whom prostate SBRT with or without ADT is&#xD;
      appropriate therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must have at least 1 MRI detected, biopsy proven site of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, prospective study aimed at recruiting the following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 evaluable participants with presumed localized prostate cancer (intermediate or high&#xD;
      risk) scheduled to undergo radiotherapy with systemic androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 evaluable participants with presumed localized prostate cancer (intermediate or high&#xD;
      risk) scheduled to undergo SBRT without androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 evaluable participants with presumed localized prostate cancer (intermediate or high&#xD;
      risk) scheduled to undergo radiotherapy with localized androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To account for non-evaluable participants, such as those found to have regional or distant&#xD;
      metastases on pretreatment 18F-DCFPyL, the accrual ceiling will be set at 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receiving neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy will undergo a second&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) at 8 weeks after initiation of ADT but&#xD;
      before SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and mpMRI 6 months following completion of&#xD;
      SBRT and at recurrence, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for up to 2 years after completion of SBRT to evaluate&#xD;
      longitudinal quality of life and biochemical control.&#xD;

    <description>For the purpose of this study, the imaging response to treatment will be categorized separately in the radiation treatment volume (in field; local) and distantly (outside the radiation treatment volume). In-field (in the radiation target volume) 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT treatment response in field will be evaluated using a descriptor (complete, partial, progression) based on maximum SUV and volume of uptake relative to the pre-treatment imaging. Presence of new areas of uptake suspicious for prostate cancer outside of the region of radiation treatment will be considered progression but will be scored separately and will not impact the assessment of response from radiation locally.</description>
