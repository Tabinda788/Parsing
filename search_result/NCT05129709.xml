  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 69% of African American (AA) Medicare beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions&#xD;
      (MCCs) such as cancer and cardiopulmonary diseases. Older age and MCCs are&#xD;
      guideline-recommended indications for referral to early palliative care to assist with&#xD;
      effective communication and value-solicitation surrounding treatment decision-making. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that early palliative care participation achieves beneficial goals of care&#xD;
      communication, quality of life (QOL), symptom burden, and mood in older adults with cancer&#xD;
      and heart failure as well as among their family caregivers. However, older AAs with MCCs,&#xD;
      especially those living in the Deep South, are less likely to have access to early palliative&#xD;
      care, even though they generally experience higher symptom burden, healthcare use, and poorer&#xD;
      communication around goals of care. This disparity in palliative care use may be, in part, to&#xD;
      a lack of culturally-responsive care practices that effectively activate AAs with MCCs to&#xD;
      identify their own values and priorities for end-of-life care. While efficacious&#xD;
      communication models exist, few have been tested in culturally-diverse samples. Guided by the&#xD;
      theory of Social Cognitive Theory and Health Behavior Model, this study's purpose is to&#xD;
      conduct a formative evaluation of a Self-directed &quot;My Health Priorities&quot; Identification&#xD;
      Program to determine cultural acceptability and feasibility of use in among AAs with MCCs in&#xD;
      a primary care setting. The 2-phase study specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. (Phase 1) Conduct a single-arm formative evaluation trial of Self-directed &quot;My Health&#xD;
      Priorities&quot; Identification Program to determine acceptability and feasibility with a sample&#xD;
      of 20 AA patients with MCCs and FCGs and adapt for future efficacy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. (Phase 2) To examine the ability of the dyads to complete pre- and post-test measures&#xD;
      of perception of care, treatment burden, shared decision-making, and communication exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from the research will directly inform a small-scale pilot grant that will&#xD;
      assess acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy of a values solicitation and&#xD;
      operationalization intervention for AAs with MCCs and caregivers.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Health Belief Model (HBM) inform this proposal. The SCT posits that human behavior is determined by expectancies- of culture, potential outcomes, and self-efficacy- and incentives. The HBM holds that health-related behavior depends on motivation, the belief that one is susceptible to serious illness, and the belief that following provider advice will reduce the threat. Concepts of health beliefs, self-efficacy, and culture must be considered when developing effective interventions for value solicitations and behavior change. This is especially true for older AAs in the Deep South, who report different lived experiences and experiences with medical icare than Whites. Patient-centered care cannot be realized for AAs without reshaping interventions to consider factors important to seriously ill older AAs with MCCs. Reframing discussion in a culturally-responsive manner is necessary to establish patient and FCG preferences prior to a health crisis.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention, the &quot;My Health Priorities&quot; Identification Program consists of four self-directed, web-based modules intended to guide patients with MCCs in identifying their own health priorities. These priorities can then be used to guide discussions with family caregivers and clinicians regarding specific goals and preferences that they wish to guide future treatment decisions. Most models of palliative care have been developed based on white middle-class populations and may not apply to African Americans (AA) who have a very different cultural value set.</description>

    <description>The web-based &quot;My Health Priorities&quot; Identification Program may improve values solicitation and operationalization skills in primary care, but has not been optimized for AAs with MCCs and their FCGs. The Program is a facilitator-led evidence- and values-based care communication model for patients, clinicians, and caregivers that has reduced patient-reported treatment burden by aligning value-based priorities with treatment. The web-based program assists patients in identifying their health priorities as they complete t four online modules that help them to identify specific and actionable health goals and preferences. The final result can be printed and brought to the clinic or uploaded to the Electronic Medical Record to inform subsequent healthcare decision making. Unrecognized cultural preferences of AAs, including the important role of R/S beliefs and family-centered values, can interfere with adequate healthcare communication resulting in healthcare disparities and inequities.</description>
