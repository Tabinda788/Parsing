  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of patient blood management is to reduce the risks of perioperative anemia- and&#xD;
      transfusion-associated complications by limiting the use and the need for allogeneic blood&#xD;
      transfusion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background of this multimodal, multidisciplinary concept are numerous studies that have shown&#xD;
      an association between preoperative anemia and/or a perioperative transfusion and a worse&#xD;
      treatment outcome concerning morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and therapy of preoperative&#xD;
      anemia and the use of machine autotransfusion are central components of this integrated&#xD;
      supply concept based on the S3 guideline &quot;Präoperative Anämie&quot;, which need to be incorporated&#xD;
      into the clinical processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, all patients undergoing elective surgery with a probability of transfusion &gt; 10%&#xD;
      receive an anemia detection during their premedication visit. Patients who are insured with&#xD;
      BARMER also get anemia diagnostic and therapy. Patients of other health insurances receive a&#xD;
      recommendation to anemia diagnostics and therapy sent to surgical department. Based on an&#xD;
      analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints of this prospective cohort study, the&#xD;
      implementation of the mentioned guideline-compliant measures in everyday clinical practice&#xD;
      and the effectiveness of an IV-PBM (Patient blood management) are to be examined. Thus, if&#xD;
      necessary, other health insurances could join the patient blood management (PBM) IV concept.&#xD;
      The aim is to provide evidence of an improved quality of treatment and the generalized&#xD;
      application of PBM measures within the scope of the innovative PBM care form described.&#xD;

    <description>Group I: BARMER insured patients with preoperative anemia and an elective (N5) surgical intervention with a probability of transfusion &gt; 10%.&#xD;
Central measures in this group are the IV contract for the creation of an organizational and financing structure for the guideline-compliant detection, diagnosis and treatment of preoperative anemia and the evaluation of the machine autotransfusion as part of the preoperative premedication visit in anesthesiology (implementation is the responsibility of the patient blood management (PBM) service).</description>

    <intervention_name>BARMER anemia treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>BARMER insured patients are informed about the machine autotransfusion directly by the patient blood management (PBM) service and its intraoperative use is organized. The aim of these measures is to ensure that the intraoperative transfusion trigger does not fall below the intraoperative transfusion trigger by integrating the PBM into standard care and to avoid a perioperative transfusion. In addition, a postoperative treatment recommendation is made for the cause-related anemia treatment, e.g. in order to reduce the risk of a renewed anemia-related perioperative transfusion risk in the event of a possible follow-up operation or other elective operations.</description>

    <intervention_name>NON-BARMER anemia treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients not insured with BARMER also receive early anemia detection, selection according to indication intervention (transfusion probability&gt; 10%) and evaluation for machine autotransfusion through the above-mentioned patient blood management (PBM) restructuring of standard care. In the case of preoperative anemia before an indication intervention and / or an intervention with machine autotransfusion application, the operating clinic will be given a recommendation by the PBM service for the diagnosis and treatment of the preoperative anemia and / or the use of the machine autotransfusion (implementation is the responsibility of the operating clinic)</description>
