  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, little knowledge exists related to the use of hemodialysis (HD) in infants and has&#xD;
      been limited to mainly single center studies. The CARPEDIEM (CArdio-Renal PEdiatric Dialysis&#xD;
      Emergency Machine) device, which can be used to provide hemodialysis in infants, has been&#xD;
      launched in the United States. This study/registry is designed to obtain data on critically&#xD;
      ill infants who require HD using the CARPEDIEM device to understand the indications for&#xD;
      initiation, best practice in prescribing and performing treatment, expected treatment course,&#xD;
      and outcomes of a dedicated infant continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective and prospective, multicenter observational quality improvement study&#xD;
      and research registry. Infants undergoing renal replacement therapy utilizing CARPEDIEM for&#xD;
      hemodialysis will be enrolled in the study for observation. There are two arms to this study,&#xD;
      one for quality improvement and one for research purposes. Patients enrolled in this study&#xD;
      have the option to participate additionally in either biospecimen collection, long term&#xD;
      follow up after CARPEDIEM, or both. Urine specimen will be collected from fresh voids, but&#xD;
      all blood specimen will be obtained from residual clinical specimen. Investigators hope to&#xD;
      gain more information into use, treatment course, and outcomes from infants requiring&#xD;
      treatment with the CARPEDIEM device.&#xD;
