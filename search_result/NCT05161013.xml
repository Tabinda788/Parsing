      The purpose of this research study is to study a method to detect pancreatic precancer and&#xD;
      cancer (ductal adenocarcinoma) using ultrasound technology in those who are at significantly&#xD;
      increased risk for developing pancreatic cancer. The LINFU™ Technique is done by analysis of&#xD;
      pancreatic fluid collected with the help of ultrasound. This is an investigational way to&#xD;
      detect pancreatic precancers and ductal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo collection of pancreatic fluid by the LINFU™ Technique as part of this&#xD;
      study. This procedure takes about 30-45 minutes. The details for the procedure are listed&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LINFU™ Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Once the participant is sedated or under anesthesia, low intensity non-focused&#xD;
           ultrasound excitation of the pancreas will be implemented. This means the sound waves&#xD;
           from the ultrasound on the top of the stomach will be used to stimulate the pancreas to&#xD;
           release juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the ultrasound, the Investigator will administer Lumason through a vein in the&#xD;
           participant's arm (IV). Lumason is a contrast agent that was frequently used to create&#xD;
           bubbles that allows a better visualization of images. In this study, Lumason will be&#xD;
           used to create bubbles and possibly increase the number of pancreatic cells collected&#xD;
           for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After 25 minutes of ultrasound, the participant will receive an IV dose of secretin over&#xD;
           1 minute. Naturally, secretin is a hormone released into the bloodstream by a part of&#xD;
           the small intestine, namely duodenum, (especially in response to acidity) to stimulate&#xD;
           secretion by the liver and pancreas. In this study, Secretin is used to increase the&#xD;
           number of pancreatic cell excretion to maximize the number of cells collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The participant will then undergo EGD (insertion of a tube down the throat and past the&#xD;
           stomach). EGD stands for esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The Investigator who is doing EGD&#xD;
           will discuss all risks and explain how the procedure will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The pancreatic juice will be collected immediately. About 15 minutes after the EGD&#xD;
           procedure has begun, a second dose of secretin will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The pancreatic juice will continue to be collected for a total of 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the LINFU technique will be provided to the investigator to help guide medical&#xD;
      care. This is an experimental technique so participants won't receive the results.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo clinical diagnostic procedures including EUS (endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound) and/or MRI as part of the standard medical care and evaluation for pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. These procedures are not part of the study and the Investigator has already&#xD;
      determined that these tests are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called 24 hours after the study procedure and 30 days after the&#xD;
      procedure to see if any symptoms of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas have&#xD;
      developed). If so, participants will be asked to come back to the clinic for further&#xD;
      evaluation as would be done as part of the standard medical care. In addition, participants&#xD;
      will have blood tests before the LINFU procedure and this will be repeated 24hours after the&#xD;
      procedure. The blood tests will measure lipase levels to make sure there was no injury to the&#xD;
      pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any identifiable private information or specimens collected and/or used for the purposes of&#xD;
      this research will not be used or distributed for future research studies.&#xD;

    <description>The cells obtained from all 10 patients undergoing LINFU™ will be analyzed microscopically and counted by a pathologist for adequacy of pancreatic cellular yield. For a LINFU test to be considered adequate, 100 well-preserved ductal cells per patient must be counted under the microscope. Cellularity of &gt;50 or &lt;100 cells per patient would be interpreted as &quot;limited but adequate&quot; and cellularity &lt;50 cells is unsatisfactory for adequacy.</description>
