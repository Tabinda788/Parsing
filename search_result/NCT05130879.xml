  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Given that the challenges in adjusting to shifting work, physical workload and&#xD;
      high-strung nature, healthcare workers often encounter high stress, emotional exhaustion, low&#xD;
      empathy, fatigue and burnout, which, in turn, result in sickness, absence, and high turnover.&#xD;
      Hence, building resilience for future adversity among healthcare workers in the workplace is&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of the Building Resilience at Work (BRAW) on&#xD;
      resilience, job engagement, intention to leave, employability, and work performance To&#xD;
      explore healthcare workers' experience of the BRAW intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study will evaluate the effectiveness of BRAW using a sequential mixed methods&#xD;
      design in two phases. In phase I, a two-armed randomized controlled trial will be conducted&#xD;
      to compare resilience, work engagement, coping skills, job satisfaction and life satisfaction&#xD;
      with a waiting list control condition among 994 healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase II, the investigators will conduct a virtual individual interview to explore&#xD;
      experiences on usability and acceptability after receiving the BRAW intervention using a&#xD;
      sample of 20 healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of research Considering the multifactorial and complexity of resilience at work&#xD;
      in an increasingly dynamic healthcare environment, the content of resilience training can&#xD;
      promote resilience, work engagement, coping skills, job satisfaction and life satisfaction&#xD;
      among healthcare workers in order to reduce the turnover rate among healthcare workers in&#xD;
      Singapore.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Research assistants and participants will be blinded to the conditions until baseline assessments (referring to the set of questionnaires they have to complete before starting the training) are completed, at which time a random number sequence in a excel file will be opened to reveal whether they will be in the intervention or waitlist condition. Participants will not be explicitly told of participants' study condition; however, they need to participate in the intervention, so full blinding is not possible</masking_description>

    <description>A 6-item Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) is used to assess the ability to recover from stress.

    <description>12-item Anticipated Turnover Scale (ATS)49 is used to measure intention to leave. Questions are related to one's anticipated length of time before leaving and certainty of leaving the job. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The total score ranges from 12 to 60, with higher scores reflecting higher degree of turnover. CVI was 0.80-0.95 for items. Cronbach's alphas were 0.85-0.94 in several researches. Test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.84 in 2 weeks' interval.</description>

    <description>A 18-item Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ) is used to measure individual work performance. The IWPQ has a recall period of 3 months and a rating scale from 0 (seldom/never) to 4 (always/often) for task, contextual performance and counterproductive work behaviour. A mean score is calculated by adding the item scores, and dividing their sum by the number of items that range between 0 and 4, with higher scores reflecting higher individual work performance. The psychometric properties of the IWPQ indicated excellent internal consistency and good validity.</description>

    <measure>Usage and satisfaction of training</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Usage is defined as an encompassing engagement, i.e., the time (in minutes) spent browsing the website and practicing the assigned homework in the previous weeks. Computer-generated indicators include the following: (1) session completion, (2) number of website visits, and (3) time spent on the website. At the end of the six-week program, attitude toward and satisfaction with the online training will be assessed using the self-developed eight-item usage and satisfaction of training. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 to 4, and response options differed for the various items. The total score ranges from 8 to 32, and a high score represents better satisfaction of training. In addition, we have four open questions to obtain suggestions for improvement.</description>
