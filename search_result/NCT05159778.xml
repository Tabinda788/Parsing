      The primary objective of this Phase 2 Simon 2-Stage study is to determinate the Overall&#xD;
      Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 following treatment with Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with ER/PR+/ HER2(-) metastatic breast cancer who have progressed through prior&#xD;
      hormone therapy with at least one CDK4/6 inhibitor, and a maximum of 1 subsequent&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. Patients will be screened for baseline anti-Î² glucan antibody level&#xD;
      (ABA; measured in peripheral blood). Those patients with an ABA greater than or equal to 20&#xD;
      mcg/ml and meeting all other I/E criteria, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 47 patients with 23 patients enrolled into Stage 1. If 4 or more&#xD;
      patients in Stage 1 have an objective response after 12 weeks of treatment, the study will&#xD;
      proceed into Stage 2. A total of 24 patients will be enrolled in Stage 2 for a total combined&#xD;
      population of 47. Overall, objective responses must be observed in 10 patients for the study&#xD;
      to be declared a success.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study PGG-BCA-2121 is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer who have progressed through prior hormonal therapy with at least one CDK4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor, and a maximum of 1 subsequent chemotherapy treatment. All patients will be immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor-naive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 47 mBCA patients will be enrolled to treatment with the combination of Imprime PGG&#xD;
      4 mg/kg with pembrolizumab 200mg. Patients will be screened and enrolled if baseline ABA&#xD;
      level is greater than or equal to 20 mcg/mL (ABA+) and if all other inclusion/ exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are met (ABA is measured in peripheral blood). Approximately 200 patients will be&#xD;
      screened (allows for pre/ early screening for ABA levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing will occur in three-week cycles. On Day 1 of each cycle, all patients will receive&#xD;
      Imprime PGG 4 mg/kg IV over ~ 2-4 hr (based on body weight) followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg,&#xD;
      IV over 30 min. On Day 8 and 15 of each cycle, patients will receive only Imprime PGG.&#xD;
      Premedications (defined by the protocol) will be administered ~30 min before initiation of&#xD;
      Imprime PGG during Cycles 1-3 (thereafter at the physician's discretion). Patients will dose&#xD;
      to confirmed progression, safety event, or other administrative reason requiring&#xD;
      discontinuation; all patients are allowed to dose up to 35 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, a baseline CT/MRI will be conducted. The first scan to assess response will&#xD;
      be conducted 12 wks post-initiation of study treatment (pre-Cycle 5) and then q12wks&#xD;
      thereafter until confirmed progression or discontinuation. At any time, if a patient's&#xD;
      response is progressive disease (PD), the patient will dose for an additional 4-8 wks&#xD;
      (physician discretion) followed by a confirmatory scan. If that scan shows progressive&#xD;
      disease, the patient will move into overall survival monitoring. Response will be assessed by&#xD;
      RECISTv1.1 and iRECIST will be applied by the Investigator solely for clinical management of&#xD;
      patients as described below. All scans will be read locally and by blinded central review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, an official diagnostic pathology report +/- archival tissue will be collected&#xD;
      to confirm historical diagnosis of ER/PR status. Two on-study, newly obtained core or&#xD;
      excisional biopsies are required, the first biopsy at baseline prior to initiation of&#xD;
      treatment and the second biopsy at 6 weeks post-initiation of drug. These paired biopsies are&#xD;
      intended for tumor microenvironment analysis. A third optional biopsy may be collected at&#xD;
      progression or end of treatment if feasible and the patient amenable. Preferably, biopsies&#xD;
      should be non-bone and if amenable, a biopsy of a liver lesion not designated as target or&#xD;
      non-target is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for safety monitoring and translational endpoints will be collected on all&#xD;
      patients as detailed in the Schedule of Activities.&#xD;
