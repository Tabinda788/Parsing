      IND 027617: This Individual Patient Expanded Access IND has been created per the request of a&#xD;
      26-year-old man who has been diagnosed with Spinal Cord Injury. The patient is a 26-year-old&#xD;
      male who suffered an unstable C-6 compressive fracture, crushing the vertebral body and&#xD;
      retropulsion of a large bone fragment into the vertebral canal, stenosing 75% of spinal canal&#xD;
      in a diving accident on 12/4/2021 in Belize City, Belize. The patient will receive a total of&#xD;
      14 autologous HB- adMSCs infusions of 200 million (2 x 10^8 cells) each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IND 027939: This individual patient expanded access IND is requested for a two-year-old boy&#xD;
      diagnosed with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy (L-CMD). In this expanded access,&#xD;
      the patient will receive the investigational product through intravenous infusions, with a&#xD;
      dose of 30 x 10^6 HB-adMSCs/ 3 ml sterile saline (1st dose), 40 x 10^6 HB-adMSCs/4 ml sterile&#xD;
      saline (2nd dose) and 50 x 10^6 HB-adMSCs / 5 ml sterile saline (3rd and remaining infusions)&#xD;
      (+ 20% cells)&#xD;
