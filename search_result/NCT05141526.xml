  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate (1) the effect of a non-restrictive satiating&#xD;
      intervention on appetite control, body weight loss and maintenance; and (2) determine whether&#xD;
      switching to a non-restrictive satiating intervention following a conventional restrictive&#xD;
      intervention can prevent increases in appetite and attenuate body weight regain usually&#xD;
      observed after weight loss in men and women living with obesity. This is an 18-month,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, parallel weight loss [Phase 1 (P1): 6 months] and maintenance trial&#xD;
      [Phase 2 (P2): 12 months] with three groups (n=234 men and women): (1) non-restrictive,&#xD;
      satiating intervention (P1) followed by a continuation of this intervention (P2); (2)&#xD;
      conventional restrictive intervention (-500 kcal/d) (P1) followed by a non-restrictive&#xD;
      satiating intervention (P2); (3) control group that follows minimal healthy guidelines (P1)&#xD;
      followed by recommended weight maintenance strategies (P2). All groups will be controlled for&#xD;
      physical activity and sleep patterns. The non-restrictive satiating intervention will include&#xD;
      guidelines and recipes to prepare highly satiating meals that will be low in energy density&#xD;
      and glycemic index and high in protein, polyunsaturated fats, vitamins and minerals (e.g.&#xD;
      calcium), and certain constituents of spices (e.g. capsaicin). Measurements at baseline (week&#xD;
      0), after P1 and P2 will include the following primary outcomes: appetite control, weight&#xD;
      loss and maintenance; and secondary outcomes: body composition, physiological, psycho and&#xD;
      neurobehavioural and health-related variables. Follow-ups will be done by a dietitian every 2&#xD;
      weeks during P1 and once a month during P2.&#xD;
