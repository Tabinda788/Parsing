      The main objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Lonca-R in&#xD;
      unfit and frail participants with previously untreated DLBCL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objectives of this trial are shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A Part 1: To assess the efficacy of a response-adapted treatment of Lonca-R in unfit&#xD;
      participants with previously untreated DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A Part 2: To compare the efficacy of Lonca-R versus combination of rituximab,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine (R mini-CHOP) in unfit participants with&#xD;
      previously untreated DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B Part 1: To assess the tolerability and efficacy of a response-adapted treatment of&#xD;
      Lonca-R in frail participants with previously untreated DLBCL who are ineligible for standard&#xD;
      R-mini-CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B Part 2: To assess the efficacy of a response-adapted treatment of Lonca-R in frail&#xD;
      participants with previously untreated DLBCL who are ineligible for standard R mini-CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simplified geriatric assessment (sGA) developed by the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL)&#xD;
      identifies three distinct categories (fit, unfit, and frail) based on age, activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and the Cumulative Illness&#xD;
      Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G). Participants will be assigned to Cohort A (unfit) or B&#xD;
      (frail) using the sGA.&#xD;
