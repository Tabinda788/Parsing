  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single laboratory session pilot study will examine the acute effects of commercially&#xD;
      available cigarettes on adult smokers' initial product perceptions, use, and exposure. Forty&#xD;
      adult daily smokers will be randomized to smoke two study-supplied commercially-available&#xD;
      cigarettes interspersed by 45 minutes, completing pre- and post-cigarette carbon monoxide and&#xD;
      questionnaire measures.&#xD;

      In some research studies, the investigators cannot tell participants exactly what the study&#xD;
      is about before they participate in the study. Study tasks will be described in this document&#xD;
      in a general way, but participants will not be told the real purpose of the study until after&#xD;
      they complete the study. The purpose of this study is broadly to learn more about how people&#xD;
      who smoke evaluate different types of commercial cigarettes. The investigators are interested&#xD;
      in how the marketing and design of different products affect perceptions and smoking&#xD;
      behaviors. This research may help inform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) how best to&#xD;
      regulate tobacco products in the future with the goal of improving public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the study, the investigators will explain why they are doing this study,&#xD;
      what they are looking at, and address any other questions. Although the real purposes of the&#xD;
      study will not be explained until after participants complete the study, there are no&#xD;
      additional risks to those described in the study consent form.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Session 1; assessed after smoking Cigarette 1 (45 min after session begins), and Cigarette 2 (90 min after session begins)</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral economic indices of demand will be measured using a hypothetical purchase task. Participants will be asked how many cigarettes (preferred brand and study-supplied) they would purchase and consume in the next 30 days across a range of prices, from free up to high amounts at which purchase/consumption is expected to drop off.</description>

    <time_frame>Session 1; assessed after smoking Cigarette 1 (45 min after session begins) and Cigarette 2 (90 min after session begins)</time_frame>
    <description>A previously validated 8-item scale17-19 will be administered at the beginning of the study session (regarding their own brand) and after each cigarette smoked in the laboratory (regarding these cigarettes), while physically viewing the pack, to assess participant's perceptions of harms from using the product. We will examine both a summed composite score and individual items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;definitely untrue&quot;, 5 = &quot;definitely true&quot;) that evaluate participants' preferred brand and the cigarettes they smoked on the following beliefs: a) &quot;lower in nicotine&quot;, b) &quot;lower in tar&quot;, c) &quot;less addictive&quot;, d) &quot;less likely to cause cancer&quot;, e) &quot;has fewer chemicals&quot;, f) &quot;is healthier&quot;, g) &quot;makes smoking safer&quot;, h) &quot;helps people quit smoking.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Session 1; assessed after smoking Cigarette 1 (45 min after session begins) and Cigarette 2 (90 min after session begins)</time_frame>
    <description>At the beginning of the study session and after using each laboratory cigarette, participants will complete a 13-item measure20 asking them to indicate on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;very low risk&quot;, 7 = &quot;very high risk&quot;) their risk of developing 11 health conditions (i.e., lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, liver disease, emphysema, respiratory infections, other cancers, and addiction) based on regular use of their preferred brand and each cigarette they sampled. Two additional items will ask about overall risks of using the cigarettes for themselves and for others.</description>

    <measure>Change in subjective ratings from Cigarette 1 to Cigarette 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1; assessed after smoking Cigarette 1 (45 min after session begins) and Cigarette 2 (90 min after session begins)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective ratings will be measured after each cigarette smoked during in-person visits using 14 individual items assessing various cigarette characteristics (e.g., strength) used by the tobacco industry and our laboratory.17,21-23 Items are rated on a 100 mm visual analog scale with item-specific anchors (e.g., strength: 0 = &quot;very weak,&quot; 100 = &quot;very strong&quot;); lower scores indicate less favorable ratings.</description>

    <measure>Change in carbon monoxide boost from Cigarette 1 to Cigarette 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1; assessed before &amp; after smoking Cigarette 1 (45 min after session begins) and Cigarette 2 (90 min after session begins)</time_frame>
    <description>CO will be measured in parts per million (ppm) using the Vitalograph BreathCO carbon monoxide monitor (Lenexa, KS) at the onset of the laboratory visit, as well as before and after each cigarette smoked. CO boost - the change in CO values resulting from smoking a cigarette - crudely estimates smoke exposure due to smoking an individual cigarette.</description>
