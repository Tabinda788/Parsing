    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the effect of multiple doses of NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 in treating&#xD;
      patients with high-grade gliomas that have come back (recurrent). NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 consists of&#xD;
      neural stem cells that carry a virus, which can kill cancer cells. Giving multiple doses of&#xD;
      NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recommended maximum tolerated number of cycles (MTC) of intracavitary (ICT)&#xD;
      administered Neural Stem Cells-expressing CRAd-S-pk7 (NSCCRAd-S-pk7) for phase II testing&#xD;
      based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the overall toxicity profile, and activity in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure possible development of antibody and T cell responses to the neural stem cells&#xD;
      (NSCs) and/or the oncolytic virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resection cavity fluid (when&#xD;
      possible to obtain by aspiration before administering study agent through the ICT Rickham),&#xD;
      and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the intracerebral biodistribution of NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 when permission to perform a&#xD;
      brain autopsy on a study participant is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Identify the evidence of possible NSC migration outside of the brain, the presence of&#xD;
      viral particles, and/or both in the CSF and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate the rates of disease response using modified Response Assessment in&#xD;
      Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6months), overall&#xD;
      survival at 9 months (OS9months), and median PFS and OS in the recurrent HGG patients, and&#xD;
      estimate the rates of disease response, PFS6months, and OS9months for the cohort of 12 GBM&#xD;
      patients at first or second recurrence who will be treated at the MTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess changes in HSPG and survivin expression in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue&#xD;
      samples treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Identify possible mechanisms of immune escape by analyzing immune cell population changes&#xD;
      in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Generate a biomathematical model to describe spatial temporal changes in tumor growth&#xD;
      that may predict the effect of NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 on tumor response based on magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo standard of care surgical resection. Patients then receive NSC-CRAd-S-pk7&#xD;
      intracerebrally over 10 minutes once weekly (QW) for up to 4 doses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
