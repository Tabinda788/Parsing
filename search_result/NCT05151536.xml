  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic dissection is the most common aortic disease leading to death. Among them, patients&#xD;
      with Stanford type A dissection (TAAD) are prone to dissection rupture in the early stage,&#xD;
      and their condition deteriorates rapidly. They need immediate surgical treatment after&#xD;
      admission.In this study, the detection data of biomarkers of nervous system Ischemia /&#xD;
      Reperfusion (I/R)injury in patients with Stanford type A dissection were retrospectively&#xD;
      analyzed, and the effects of different doses of adrenaline on biomarkers of nervous system&#xD;
      I/R injury were evaluated by statistical methods.The information of 132 patients with&#xD;
      Stanford type A aortic dissection who underwent sun's operation in the Department of&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgery of the first medical center of the PLA General Hospital from January&#xD;
      2012 to January 2019 was retrospectively analyzed.&#xD;
