  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will apply state of the art radiology through advanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) techniques to investigate structural and functional brain effects of electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a multi-disciplinary collaboration, imaging findings will be correlated to psychiatric&#xD;
      response parameters, neuropsychological functioning as well as neurochemical and genetic&#xD;
      biomarkers that can elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The aim is to document both&#xD;
      treatment effects and potential harmful effects of ECT and TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample, three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECT: n = 50 patients in a major depressive episode (bipolar and major depressive disorder)&#xD;
      who have accepted treatment with ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS: n = 50 patients in a major depressive episode (bipolar and major depressive disorder)&#xD;
      who have accepted treatment with TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HC: = 50 age and gender matched healthy volunteers not receiving ECT nor TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation time: six months, with the time points as specified below. ECT is typically given&#xD;
      three times weekly, but exceptions may occur. Hence, time points are specified as the number&#xD;
      of ECT treatments given rather than an exact number of days which will vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tp1: 2 hours before the first treatment session (day 1, baseline), Tp2: 2 hours after the&#xD;
      first treatment session (day 1), Tp3: before the 7th ECT session and corresponding time point&#xD;
      for TMS (~ day 15), Tp4: 1-2 weeks after last treatment session (~ day 30 - 50), Tp5: 6&#xD;
      months after treatment (~ day 180),&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls are only assessed at Tp1,2,4,5&#xD;
