  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with anti-PD1 antibodies provides encouraging results on a subset of patients.&#xD;
      Capmatinib, a MET inhibitor, has shown an imunomodulatory effect and a synergy with&#xD;
      spartalizumab a PD-1 inhibitor. The purpose of this phase II trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination of capmatinib + spartalizumab in adult patients with&#xD;
      advanced oesogastric adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
