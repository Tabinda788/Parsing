  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a context where yoga is more and more popularized in France and in Europe, and where&#xD;
      Yogatherapy (as complementary medicine) begins to make its place in the care of patients in&#xD;
      French hospitals, it seems interesting to us to study the impact of yoga in the chronic pain&#xD;
      patient treated in a specific pain consultation by this non-pharmacological approach, and&#xD;
      accessible.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yoga is a discipline that has its origins in India for nearly 5,000 years, and which aims to&#xD;
      bring physical, mental and spiritual well-being through postures, stretching, breathing&#xD;
      exercises and meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive and having very few side effects, this approach allows the practitioner to&#xD;
      reclaim their body, to know themselves better, to accept their limits, to respect them and to&#xD;
      empower themselves in their care and pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More and more studies are now looking at the positive effect of yoga whether it is on stress&#xD;
      by demonstrating the drop in cortisol in participants, or on the reduction of symptoms of&#xD;
      depression, improvement of immune function, or pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no study of the impact of yoga for analgesic treatment has been carried out&#xD;
      in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this retrospective study, we wish to demonstrate a reduction in pain and / or an&#xD;
      improvement in the quality of life.&#xD;
