  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation study of the safety and tolerability of oncolytic&#xD;
      virus injection(RT-01) when administered via intratumoral injection in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RT-01 and&#xD;
      to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further study. The study will also&#xD;
      evaluate antitumor activity, objective response rate, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of&#xD;
      RT-01.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated , open-label, study of RT-01 given via intratumoral (IT)&#xD;
      injection as a single agent in participants with advanced solid tumors. The study is a single&#xD;
      agent dose escalation which will use a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of RT-01.&#xD;
      Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately&#xD;
      7-18 evaluable participants enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of intratumoral administration of RT-01 as a single agent. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      will assess efficacy overall response rate, as well as disease control rate, progression free&#xD;
      survival, duration of response, and anti-tumor immune responses.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigational product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP</description>

    <description>Changes in tumor size and occurrence of metastases was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete Response is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). And Stable Disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.</description>
