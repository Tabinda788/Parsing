  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pharmacokinetic (PK) trial is to evaluate whether the ENG implant, a&#xD;
      long-acting birth control method, is tolerable and effective for adults with HIV who are&#xD;
      taking long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA) and long-acting rilpivirine (RPV-LA). Access to safe&#xD;
      and effective birth control for adults with HIV is important because it may result in fewer&#xD;
      infants exposed to HIV in the womb or born with HIV. Researchers believe that people of&#xD;
      childbearing potential need access to birth control options that do not need to be negotiated&#xD;
      with a partner.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to study entry by any US&#xD;

                  www.frontierscience.org): Calculated Creatinine Clearance - Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  Equation (Adult).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Group A: Presence of HIV-1 Infection Documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV&#xD;
        enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry&#xD;
        and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than&#xD;
        the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group B: Absence of HIV-1 infection Documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV E/CIA&#xD;
        test kit obtained within 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit or, for sites located in&#xD;
        countries other than the United States, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an&#xD;
        oversight body within that country and validated internally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&#xD;
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is&#xD;
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test&#xD;
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a&#xD;
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus&#xD;
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willingness to adhere to the following contraception requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Individuals who are participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy&#xD;
             must agree to use a non-hormonal method of contraception in addition to the ENG&#xD;
             implant while participating in the study. Acceptable forms of contraception include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Receiving monthly CARLA for ≥24 weeks immediately prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE A: Oral CAB+RPV bridging that was used to cover one or more missed injection(s) is&#xD;
        acceptable. If the individual missed an injection within the 24 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
        without oral bridging of CAB+RPV until the next injection was received, this would be&#xD;
        defined as a missed dose and is exclusionary. The last dose of oral CAB+RPV must have&#xD;
        occurred more than 4 weeks prior to study entry, with an intervening injection of CARLA&#xD;
        since that oral dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE B: For individuals co-enrolling from a study through which they are receiving CARLA,&#xD;
        sites must document the study number and the participant's identifier on that study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             to study entry by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent,&#xD;
             or at any network-approved non-US laboratory that is VQA certified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 plasma RNA of &lt;200 copies/mL obtained within 30 days prior to study entry by any&#xD;
