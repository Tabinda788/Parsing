  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canadians with neurocognitive disorders often are admitted to nursing homes when their&#xD;
      disease reaches an advanced stage. At the end of their life, they may encounter adverse&#xD;
      symptoms related to medications they no longer need, while they should receive comfort care.&#xD;
      This study proposes an intervention to reduce the use of inappropriate medications among&#xD;
      residents of nursing homes with major neurocognitive disorders. For that purpose, nursing&#xD;
      homes' nursing staff, physicians and pharmacists will receive education and tools for the&#xD;
      review, adjustment or discontinuation of the medications that have become inappropriate for&#xD;
      the residents. The residents' families will receive information regarding the complexity of&#xD;
      drug treatment for elderly patients with major neurocognitive disorders and they will be kept&#xD;
      informed about the proposed changes to their relative's medication. The intervention is&#xD;
      expected to reduce the medication load while improving or maintaining the residents'&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental, cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) based on the results of a&#xD;
      pilot study (). The study will take place over 6 months in 6 nursing homes (NHs) of the&#xD;
      greater Quebec City Health Board, the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services&#xD;
      sociaux de la Capitale-Nationale (CIUSSS-CN). Three NHs will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm, three others will serve as controls, where care will be dispensed as usual.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be sought from the representative of NH residents with major&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention in experimental NHs First, all members of the care teams, i.e. nursing staff,&#xD;
      physicians and pharmacists, will receive an enriched continuous education-knowledge exchange&#xD;
      session to inform them on the study rationale and the means of medication optimization. This&#xD;
      session will provide tools and strategies on adjustment of certain medications (e.g. less&#xD;
      stringent treatment goals for control of glycaemia or hypertension, alternatives to&#xD;
      benzodiazepines). There will be an additional emphasis on tapering and discontinuation of&#xD;
      antipsychotics. Second, the validated lists of &quot;generally&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; or &quot;rarely&quot;&#xD;
      appropriate medications for NH residents with major neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs) will be&#xD;
      provided to the experimental NHs' staff. They will also receive algorithms on tapering of&#xD;
      antipsychotics. The pharmacists will initiate the intervention by performing at least one&#xD;
      medication review for each participating resident, shortly after baseline, and additional&#xD;
      reviews if required by the participant's clinical condition. The pharmacists' medication&#xD;
      review will result in recommendations to be discussed with nurses and the responsible&#xD;
      physician in usual care team meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Medication regimens will be recorded over 6 months and the active medications&#xD;
      corresponding to the lists of &quot;generally&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; or &quot;rarely&quot; appropriate medications&#xD;
      counted. At baseline and 6 months after the beginning of the intervention, participating&#xD;
      residents will be observed for signs of discomfort (PACSLAC) and agitation (Cohen-Mansfield&#xD;
      Agitation Inventory).&#xD;
