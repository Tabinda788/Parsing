  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a live biobank study for Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients where samples&#xD;
      will be collected at inflection points in the course of the disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test this hypothesis the investigators will focus on studying TNBC patients using an&#xD;
      innovative approach, the DIGNITY Study (De-convoluting interactions between genes, the cancer&#xD;
      environment, and the immune system to develop therapies that work for you) designed to&#xD;
      building a live tissue biobank of Patient Derived Tumor Organoids (PDOs) derived from tumor&#xD;
      at surgery, preceded or not by neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), and at recurrence/metastasis. TNBC&#xD;
      patients enrolled in this study are consented to enable investigators to generate a biobank&#xD;
      of tumor tissue (obtained from surgically removed excess that would otherwise be disposed off&#xD;
      ) and matched blood cells ( obtained from an already existing line or a venipuncture ordered&#xD;
      per standard of care testing) at key timepoints in their treatment course.&#xD;

    <description>Tumor tissue will be collected from consented patients at sequential inflection points in the disease course: at the time of initial diagnosis, at the time of surgery and during recurrence or metastasis. In addition to this, 40ml of research bloods will also be collected at these key inflection points.</description>

    <textblock>
      Tissue collection through the DIGNITY trial will allow the investigators to study the&#xD;
      individual tumor and its microenvironment from a biopsy specimen at sequential inflection&#xD;
      points and to perform functional genomics experiments using the PDOs technology to determine&#xD;
      if the cancer cells can be reprogrammed using radiotherapy and other interventions. Paired&#xD;
      blood samples from the patients at each time point will be collected to study circulating&#xD;
      cytokines/chemokines, tumor-specific T cells, and innate immune cell response to the PDO.&#xD;
