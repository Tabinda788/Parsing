    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study,&#xD;
      evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical antitumor&#xD;
      activity of XL114 administered alone orally to subjects with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
      The objectives of the study also include determining the recommended dose (RD) and/or maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of XL114.&#xD;
