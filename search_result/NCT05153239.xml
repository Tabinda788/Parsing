  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled phase III clinical trial to evaluate and&#xD;
      compare the activity and safety of two experimental arms consisting of lurbinectedin as&#xD;
      single agent (Group A) or the combination of lurbinectedin with irinotecan (Group B) versus&#xD;
      Investigator's Choice (topotecan or irinotecan) as control arm (Group C), in Small-cell Lung&#xD;
      Cancer (SCLC) patients who failed one prior platinum-containing line.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 705 Adult SCLC patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
      performance status (PS) ≤ 2 who have failed one prior platinum-containing line with CTFI ≥ 30&#xD;
      days and controlled asymptomatic Central Nervous System metastases will be enrolled and&#xD;
      assigned to each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central randomization will be implemented; patients will be assigned to each treatment arm at&#xD;
      a 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will oversee the conduct of the study. The&#xD;
      IDMC should have access to unblinded efficacy and safety data throughout the trial to enable&#xD;
      timely and informed judgments about risks and benefits.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the date of progressive disease, death or last tumor assessment or further anticancer treatment, up to 39 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of documented progression per RECIST v.1.1 (Progressive disease is declared when there is an increase in sum of target disease ≥ 20%) or death (regardless of the cause of death).

    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) will be the best response obtained in any evaluation according to RECIST v.1.1. Progressive disease is declared when there is an increase in sum of target disease ≥ 20%, stable disease when the change is &gt; -30% and ≤ 20%, partial response when there is a decrease in sum of target disease ≥ 30%, and complete response when all lesions have disappeared or all lesions have disappeared and all nodal disease is &lt; 10 mm each.</description>
