      Gas station workers are exposed to carcinogenic substances.This increases risk of their&#xD;
      exposure to hematological diseases such as lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and myelogenous leukemia (AML), as well as&#xD;
      different forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma. Thus, the early&#xD;
      identification of this condition between the gas station workers may prevent the&#xD;
      hematological disease progression.&#xD;

      It is known that severe bone marrow dysplasia is frequently accompanied by early alterations&#xD;
      in the immune system and in peripheral cell subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone marrow injury by benzene metabolites is a strong predisposing factor in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Benzene-induced hematopoietic disease .Thus, the early identification of this&#xD;
      condition between the gas station workers may prevent the hematological disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reactive metabolite of benzene, 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) is suggested to be a key molecule&#xD;
      of benzene-induced hematotoxicity and carcinogenicity as it cause abnormal accumulation of&#xD;
      myeloid cells and precursors, which cause benzene induced cytopenia and myeloid dysplasia in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
