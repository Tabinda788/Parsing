  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to gain knowledge concerning expression of immune markers on immune&#xD;
      cell subpopulation of PBMCs from subjects without cancer diagnosis and cancer patients. Few&#xD;
      studies have addressed the question of the difference of peripheric immune cells between&#xD;
      these two populations without a specific focus on an immune cell population or an indication,&#xD;
      and with a multiparametic approach. The present study will combine phenotypic (using cell&#xD;
      population markers and immune checkpoints) and functional analyses toallow to better&#xD;
      interpret non-clinical results obtained with either subjects without cancer or cancer patient&#xD;
      material and provide rationale to use material from subjects without cancer diagnosis for&#xD;
      functional tests. It would also argument a go to healthy volunteer's clinical trials for&#xD;
      assessing peripheral pharmacodynamic (PD), receptor occupancy (RO) and safety (Cytokine&#xD;
      release syndrome, CRS), in the context of early drug development in immuno-oncology. Finally,&#xD;
      generated data will be used to feed quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) models to increase&#xD;
      their robustness and better predict drug pharmacology in humans.&#xD;
