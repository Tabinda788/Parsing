  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research, the main purpose is to determine the comparison of acute effect of sciatic&#xD;
      nerve gliding and lower extremity dynamic stretching exercises on hamstring flexibility and&#xD;
      athletic performance. The participants will be begin with warm-up sessions for 3-5 minutes&#xD;
      then baseline data (pre-test): hamstring flexibility will be measured. The order of pre-test&#xD;
      will be randomized and same order will be used for post-test. This is a community service&#xD;
      addition, added so that everyone in the society can get to know the effects of nerve gliding&#xD;
      and lower extremity dynamic stretches on hamstring flexibility, will be cost effective, and&#xD;
      will reduce their visits to the therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial with 1 month follow-up. The sample size is 40. subjects will be&#xD;
      divided in two groups, 20 athletes will be given a session of sciatic nerve gliding while&#xD;
      lower extremity stretch will be given to remaining 20 athletes. Study duration is of 6&#xD;
      months.Sampling technique employed will be convenient with random assignment. Individuals of&#xD;
      age group 18-40 years having male gender regularly exercise at least once a week for 30&#xD;
      minutes. Tools used in the study are Universal inclinometer and Active knee extension test&#xD;
      and SLR TEST. Data will be analyzed through IBM SPSS 23&#xD;

    <description>Participants were asked to do SLR and active knee extensions and then measure range of hamstrings and then note the range by goniometer .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SLR test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 WEEKS</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to lie down in a supine position and were asked to raise their both leg one by one. In order to measure hamstring flexibility center of the goniometer was placed at the greater trochanter level its proximal arm at midline of pelvis and distal arm along the shaft of the femur referring lateral epicondyle. After which scoring were noted in which &gt;110 showed excellent scoring, 80 to 110 showed good scoring and 60 to 79 showed fair scoring of the hamstring muscle flexibility</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Extension test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 WEEKS</time_frame>
    <description>For active knee extension test participant one leg is vertically extended and the other leg was flexed on the level of hip joint and then the participants was asked to extend the knee. The point where the vertical leg starts to move is recorded. The angle between the thighs is measured, if the knee was fully extended it was noted as 0 and if it shows slight flexion that was noted as positive number like 20 or 30 degree. By following the same protocol both right and left legs were recorded. Normal knee extension ranges from 130_140 to 0 degree knee extension less than the range was written as negative number</description>
