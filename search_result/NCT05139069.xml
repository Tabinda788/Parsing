  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis may be a viable option for African American women at-risk for HIV&#xD;
      infection, but few studies have identified optimal strategies to reach African American women&#xD;
      in need of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis nor examined effective strategies to scale-up&#xD;
      Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among African American women in the South. African American women in&#xD;
      the South experience high rates of intimate partner violence which could force women to&#xD;
      choose between HIV prevention or intimate partner violence prevention. The proposed research&#xD;
      study seeks to develop, pilot-test, and evaluate a Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Implementation&#xD;
      Toolkit within two community healthcare clinics located in Jackson, Mississippi to increase&#xD;
      Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis uptake among African American, address intimate partner violence as&#xD;
      a barrier to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis uptake, and ultimately combat racial disparities in&#xD;
      women's HIV diagnoses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV and intimate partner violence are intersecting, mutually-reinforcing epidemics that&#xD;
      significantly affect African American women, particularly women in the U.S. South. African&#xD;
      American women face some of the highest rates of both HIV and intimate partner violence among&#xD;
      U.S. women, and these burdens are most pronounced in the South. African American surviving&#xD;
      intimate partner violence may experience forced, condom less sex, which increases the risk of&#xD;
      HIV acquisition. Pre-exposure prophylaxis has the potential to be the most innovative HIV&#xD;
      prevention strategy, however it remains underutilized by African American women and residents&#xD;
      of the South. In order to reduce African American women's HIV acquisition risk in the South,&#xD;
      effective HIV prevention interventions need to concurrently address relationship safety and&#xD;
      HIV acquisition risks. Developing effective interventions to tackle this HIV-related&#xD;
      disparity among African American women is essential to reach national HIV goals.Therefore,&#xD;
      the proposed research aims to develop, test, and evaluate a Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis&#xD;
      Implementation Toolkit for clinical staff in community healthcare settings in the South. The&#xD;
      Toolkit will be evaluated using the Reach, Effectiveness-Adoption, Implementation,&#xD;
      Maintenance (RE-AIM). The Toolkit will serve the dual purpose of increasing Pre-Exposure&#xD;
      Prophylaxis uptake among African American women in the South while addressing intimate&#xD;
      partner violence as a potential Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis barrier. This research project will&#xD;
      include a formative evaluation (i.e., reach stage), including key informant interviews with&#xD;
      clinical staff at the partnering community healthcare clinics (N=10), and six focus groups&#xD;
      with African American women at risk for HIV acquisition (i.e., Pre-Exposure&#xD;
      Prophylaxis-eligible; %50 intimate partner violence-exposed). The qualitative data from the&#xD;
      formal evaluation will inform the development of the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Implementation&#xD;
      Toolkit, including detailed curriculum and supporting materials. The Toolkit will be pilot&#xD;
      tested in two community healthcare clinics using a nonrandomized waitlist control design&#xD;
      employed at the clinic-level. Clinic 1 will receive the Toolkit; and after the 8-month data&#xD;
      is collected, Clinic 2 will receive the Toolkit. Changes in Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis uptake&#xD;
      and retention in care will be assessed at the clinic level from 8-months before and after the&#xD;
      Toolkit is implemented (i.e., effectiveness stage). To examine these effects at the&#xD;
      clinic-level, a series of interrupted time series analyses will be conducted. This approach&#xD;
      allows us to analyze population changes as opposed to individual change. To yield a moderate&#xD;
      effect size with a power=.80 and alpha =.05, a sample size of at least 8 timepoints are&#xD;
      needed. Following the Toolkit's implementation, four focus groups with clinical staff will be&#xD;
      conducted to assess barriers and facilitators (i.e., adoption stage). Lastly, key informant&#xD;
      interviews with clinical staff (N=20) will be conducted to assess fidelity of the Toolkit's&#xD;
      components.&#xD;

Overall, the Toolkit is designed to create culturally-congruent, intimate partner violence-informed clinical settings; and equip clinical staff with the knowledge and skills they need to address HIV prevention for African American women; and integrate intimate partner violence into Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis care services.</description>
