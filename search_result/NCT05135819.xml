  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social participation and social relationships are relevant aspects of older adult's&#xD;
      psychosocial well-being. In this regard, specific interest is devoted to Information and&#xD;
      Communication Technologies (ICT) which enable to connect people and to support their social&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the number of older Internet users constantly increased in the last decades, older&#xD;
      adults still display reduced Internet access compared to younger generations. Italian elderly&#xD;
      people are severely penalized by this &quot;gray digital divide&quot;. The pandemia due to COVID-19&#xD;
      spread has exasperated the situation, leading to the paradox of having people putatively most&#xD;
      beneficent of use as those most excluded, due to scanty of competencies and of suitable and&#xD;
      agreeable learning occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cyber School for Grandparents is an innovative intergenerational educational program&#xD;
      aimed to bridge the digital divide by training secondary school students (aged 15-17 years)&#xD;
      to become cyber tutors for their grandparents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will take place during the 2021/2022 school year, as part of the curricular&#xD;
      activities of 3 classes at the local Human Science High School. The intervention was designed&#xD;
      to be personalized and inclusive, in order to meet the need of each student-senior dyad,&#xD;
      regardless of their starting digital skills and attitudes toward technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present mixed-method feasibility study is to qualitatively evaluate&#xD;
      students' participation and learning throughout the course and to measure grandparents'&#xD;
      pre-post changes in mobile device actual use, self-reported proficiency and attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, eventual pre-post changes on aging stereotypes and psychosocial well-being of the&#xD;
      participants will be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systematic reviews of qualitative studies on older adults ICT users highlighted that the&#xD;
      principal drives for use were the desire to keep in touch with family and friends and to&#xD;
      enter into intergenerational communication, whereas main obstacles are their distrust in&#xD;
      terms of perceived utility, privacy concerns as well as technical difficulties. As regards&#xD;
      the learning context, old persons prefer to rely on their own social network to acquire&#xD;
      digital competence and spontaneously refer to their younger family members that may act as&#xD;
      &quot;warm&quot; experts on ICT use. ICT use among older adults may thus be favored by properly&#xD;
      designed educational interventions, focused on their interests, needs and concerns about&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational program will be delivered to 3 classes of the local Human Science High&#xD;
      School. Students will be asked to involve at least one grandparent willing to participate in&#xD;
      the initiative. To assure the active participation of the entire classes, if some students&#xD;
      were not able to involve any grandparent, community-dwelling older adults would be enrolled&#xD;
      among those participating in ongoing studies at the Golgi Cenci Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the previously reported intergenerational programs on ICT use, the present&#xD;
      initiative shows relevant innovative features: the educational lessons will be embedded in&#xD;
      the students school program instead of being offered on a volunteering basis, the students&#xD;
      will independently plan and implement the cyber sessions for their grandparents outside the&#xD;
      school as extracurricular activities and, whenever possible, the program will involve&#xD;
      familial dyads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course is composed of 3 different modules: theory (2 lessons), method (2 lessons) and&#xD;
      practice (6 lessons). Theoretical lessons will deal with the aging process and its effect on&#xD;
      cognition and learning process, issues and peculiarities of older adults ICT use, andragogy&#xD;
      and strategies to favor the learning process of new skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the methodological lessons, students will be instructed on the importance of data&#xD;
      collection for research purposes and on the specific features and administration modalities&#xD;
      of the assessment tools to be compiled by their grandparents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the practical module, students will be guided in the implementation of the one-to-one&#xD;
      cyber sessions for their grandparents, which will be then conducted independently during&#xD;
      extracurricular hours and customized according to the needs and interests of each senior&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-post outcome measures will be remotely collected both for students and for seniors.&#xD;
      Assessment will be performed through online surveys shared within the web-based platform&#xD;
      adopted by the school to perform remote lessons during the COVID-19 pandemic (Google&#xD;
      Classroom). All the instruments selected are suitable for self-compiling both by young&#xD;
      students and older adults. The students will help and supervise grandparents to manage&#xD;
      possible technical and/or sensory difficulties with the online compiling procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, students will compile an online diary for each of the 4 practical modules, before&#xD;
      the next group lesson scheduled, comprising both an activity and a learning log. The activity&#xD;
      log consists of structured questions on the number, frequency, duration, content and modality&#xD;
      (in-person or remotely) of the cyber sessions performed with the senior mentee. The learning&#xD;
      log will comprise broad guiding questions to reflect on the learning process favoured by the&#xD;
      activities and to record the student's observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, at the end of the experience, students and grandparents satisfaction and opinion on&#xD;
      the experience will be assessed using a questionnaire with both close-ended and open-ended&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For students: attending one of the 3 classes involved in the project&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For seniors: be a grandparents of the students involved and willing to participate in&#xD;

&#xD;
        No specific inclusion criteria were set regarding age, ICT proficiency, socioeconomic,&#xD;
