  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To analyze the clinical features of a cohort of patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy&#xD;
           (BCR), an inflammatory bilateral ocular disease, affecting the choroid and the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Various imaging techniques will be used to assess the effect of the disease on the&#xD;
           retina and the choroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A standardized assessment of the visual function will be performed with visual acuity,&#xD;
           visual field and color vision testing. The quality of life of the patients will be&#xD;
           evaluated with the VFQ-25 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These analyses will help delineating different forms of the disease among its&#xD;
           heterogeneous presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify predisposing factors for the disease. The condition is unique from the&#xD;
           immunogenetic standpoint by its association with the HLA-A29 allele, which is the&#xD;
           strongest link between an HLA class I antigen and a disease. To date, however, the&#xD;
           mechanisms leading to birdshot chorioretinopathy remain unknown. GWAS (Genome Wide&#xD;
           association Study) based on DNA of the cohort patients will be performed with the aim to&#xD;
           identify other susceptibility genes associated with BCR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a bilateral chronic posterior uveitis that has been named in&#xD;
      1980. The &quot;birdshot lesions&quot; are the hallmark of the disease. In their most typical aspect&#xD;
      these lesions are ovoid shaped hypopigmented spots at the level of the choroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main difficulties of the diagnosis lies in the spectrum of presentations of the&#xD;
      disease. The typical birdshot lesions are ovoid with their main axis oriented toward the&#xD;
      optic disc. However, some are round and the can be clearly seen on fundus examination while&#xD;
      others can be limited to subtle depigmentations. Typical lesions are one-quarter to one-half&#xD;
      disc diameters, but confluent lesions may yield larger areas of depigmentation that are&#xD;
      difficult to recognize. Although the typical lesions are depigmented, their presentation may&#xD;
      change over time and pigment or atrophy may replace the initial cream-colored spots. The&#xD;
      typical location, or the most easily seen location of the spots, is nasal to the optic disc.&#xD;
      However, involvement of the posterior pole inside the temporal arcade is also possible. The&#xD;
      spots usually predominate in the mid-periphery, but may also extend to the equator. A&#xD;
      standardized classification of the birdshot lesions according to their size, their number,&#xD;
      their pigmentation and their localization has been suggested to help in the categorization of&#xD;
      the various disease presentations and for the longitudinal follow-up of affected patients.&#xD;
      Spots clearly visible at the time of the diagnosis may disappear later. Hence, if the&#xD;
      diagnosis of the birdshot chorioretinopathy is not made when spots are clearly visible, later&#xD;
      presentations may not meet the definition commonly used for the disease. The disappearance of&#xD;
      birdshot spots after treatment has been documented, but the effect of treatment on spots has&#xD;
      not yet been assessed in large cohorts of patients. Indocyanine green angiography has been&#xD;
      suggested as a reliable method to detect spots. However, it remains to be validated by a&#xD;
      randomized assessment comparing indocyanine green angiography to color photographs for the&#xD;
      detection of birdshot lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescein angiography is useful in patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy to assess&#xD;
      disease activity. In active disease, angiographic findings include leakage of the retinal&#xD;
      veins, macular edema and optic disk hyperfluorescence. These findings are not disease&#xD;
      specific, but they require a careful examination of the fundus seeking subtle spots when&#xD;
      birdshot lesions are not obvious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above, the first goal of our prospective cohort study is to assess the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the disease, its spectrum of presentation and its evolution over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the characteristics of birdshot chorioretinopathy is its association with the HLA-A29&#xD;
      allele, which constitutes the strongest link between a disease and class I HLA allele. The&#xD;
      mechanism by which HLA-A29 confers a risk for birdshot chorioretinopathy is a key question&#xD;
      that remains unanswered. As with other associations between HLA class I antigens and diseases&#xD;
      (HLA-B27 with spondylarthropathies and HLA B51 with Behçet's disease), the physiopathogeny of&#xD;
      these links have not been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other factors playing a role in the physiopathogeny of the disease and not linked to the&#xD;
      major histocompatibility complex are researched. A few families of patients with birdshot&#xD;
      chorioretinopathy have been reported, which could point to additional genetic factors for&#xD;
      disease susceptibility but does not rule out an environmental effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the complex physiopathology of birdshot chorioretinopathy could involve the HLA-A29&#xD;
      allele, other unknown genetic factors, as well as environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above, we are planning a GWAS (Genome Wide association Study) based on DNA of the&#xD;
      cohort patients, which will be performed with the aim to identify other susceptibility genes&#xD;
      associated with BCR.&#xD;
