  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rady Children's Hospital San Diego (RCHSD), UCSD Division of Child and Community Health and&#xD;
      the Center for Community Health, and Northgate Gonzalez (NG) Markets will collaborate to&#xD;
      create a Produce Prescription Program (Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program) to be&#xD;
      implemented in the RCHSD Diabetes Clinic. We will provide families on Medi-Cal who have a&#xD;
      child with T2DM with a fruit and vegetable prescription (FVRx) which will enhance their&#xD;
      ability to purchase GusNIP-eligible fresh fruits and vegetables (FV). These prescriptions&#xD;
      will be delivered in the form of an electronic voucher that can be filled at any NG Markets&#xD;
      throughout San Diego and Riverside counties. The goal of this program is to increase the&#xD;
      purchase and consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, decrease food insecurity, and&#xD;
      improve metabolic outcomes for children with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;

      Participants upon enrollment will be randomized into two groups, either to immediately&#xD;
      receive nutrition incentive vouchers for 12 months (intervention group) or to receive&#xD;
      nutrition incentive vouchers for 12 months after a 6-month delay (delayed-intervention&#xD;
      group). To evaluate the implementation and outcomes of this program, we will collect fruit&#xD;
      and vegetable prescription (FVRx) voucher data in addition to standardized laboratory&#xD;
      studies, (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and liver function tests&#xD;
      (LFTs)) and physiologic assessments (height, weight) at the child's follow-up appointments&#xD;
      through the Diabetes Clinic. These markers will be evaluated at baseline, 6-, 12- and&#xD;
      18-months. Additionally, we will ask participants to complete online or phone surveys&#xD;
      including the Dietary Screener Questionnaire (DSQ) for youth and parents and the 18-item US&#xD;
      Household Food Security Survey Module every 6 months.&#xD;
