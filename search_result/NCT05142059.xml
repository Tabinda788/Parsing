  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to explore the relationship between the onset of fall and&#xD;
      the time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) in this CMT1A patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients with balance disorders and therefore a risk of&#xD;
      major fall will require a longer time to perform the Timed Up and Go test. In addition, it&#xD;
      seems important to confirm that the severity of the disease has a negative impact on the&#xD;
      frequency of balance disorders.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Charcot-Marie Tooth disease is the most frequent and common inherited neuropathy with the&#xD;
      various forms and subtypes. The CMT-1A is the most frequent form of the disease and&#xD;
      represents more than eighty percent of the all subtypes. In view of different clinical&#xD;
      elements (muscular strength deficit, walking and balance disorders, podological impairment),&#xD;
      patients with CMT seem to be able to present an increased risk of fall. In 2017 pilot study&#xD;
      supports this. More recently, a study by Ramdharry et al. appears to confirm this with a&#xD;
      cohort of 252 patients with CMT, 86% of whom have experienced at least one major fall or loss&#xD;
      of balance. This increased incidence of falls is also found in children and adolescents with&#xD;
      CMT with consequences in terms of injury and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic screening of the risk of falls in this population is necessary, but no prospective&#xD;
      studies on the occurrence of falls and its detection have yet been carried out in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study focusing on this issue in order to standardize the assessment of postural control&#xD;
      disorders using a simple test of common clinical practice seems necessary.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The patients will be recruited in the PMR and neurology departments within the framework of their pathology (current care) and via an older cohort of CMT1A. During a follow-up medical consultation, patients will be informed about the study. If patients express an interest, participants will be listed as a potential attendee. After reflection, patients will be contacted to confirm their participation and an appointment will be set. An assessment will be carried out within the PMR Department of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital. The doctor will present the protocol in detail to the patients. Upon reading the information form, the doctor will obtain written consent. Clinical information and the results of the various tests will be recorded. Participants will then be compared with each other and over time. Secondly, patients will be contacted by telephone at 6 months to receive any self-reported fall via a standardized questionnaire.</intervention_model_description>
