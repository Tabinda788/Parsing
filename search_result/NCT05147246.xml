  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teachers' social emotional learning/competence (SEL/SEC) can influence teachers' ability in&#xD;
      developing healthy teacher-student relationship, managing classroom, implementing&#xD;
      evidence-based SEL promotion strategies in classroom, and supporting students' parents. Also,&#xD;
      most SEL/SEC interventions have not considered gender equity. Given high prevalence of&#xD;
      gender-based violence and high exposure to adverse environment for teachers in low income&#xD;
      countries (LIC), which may lead them to greater risk for lower SEC, transforming current&#xD;
      education system and considering gender equity and SEL/SEC promotion curriculum to both&#xD;
      teachers and children is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to respond to this need by adapting a locally supported&#xD;
      evidence-based-intervention (EBI) for children and further integrates SEL/SEC curriculum for&#xD;
      teachers and gender equity component. The EBI to be adapted in this study is&#xD;
      ParentCorps-Professional Development (PD), a school-based EBI that trains, empowers, and&#xD;
      supports teachers to apply EBI strategies to promote child SEL/SEC and academic learning, and&#xD;
      reduce behavioral problems. Two pilot implementation studies from prior work conducted in&#xD;
      Uganda and Nepal have demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, usefulness, and efficacy of PD&#xD;
      in diverse low resource contexts. PD has shown positive impacts on multiple-level, including&#xD;
      positive changes on students' emotional regulation and social competency, teacher-student&#xD;
      relationship, and classroom social emotion climate. The proposed research builds on prior&#xD;
      positive evidence and further partner with policy and relevant stakeholders to integrate&#xD;
      gender equity and teacher SEL/SEC curriculum into the PD (as the PD-Enhance) as well as to&#xD;
      test scalable strategies to provide the enhanced PD curriculum at the system level.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Score on Social Competence Scale - Parent (SCP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4-6</time_frame>
    <description>SCP is a 12-item measure that assesses a child's prosocial behaviors, communication skills, and self control. Each item states a behavior that a child may display in a social setting. The parent assesses how well each statement describes the child. Responses are coded on a 5-pt Likert scale: 0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=moderately well, 3=well, and 4=very well. The total score range is 0-48; the higher the score, the better the child is able to regulate his/her emotions.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) - Teacher</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4-6</time_frame>
    <description>DERS measures emotion dysregulation in an individual. The 18 items, 5 point scale (1=Almost Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=About Half the Time, 4=Most of the Time, 5=Almost Always) yield scores on (a) awareness and understanding of emotions; (b) acceptance of emotions; (c) the ability to control impulses and behave in accordance with goals in the presence of negative affect; and (d) access to emotion regulation strategies that are perceived to be effective for feeling better. The total score range is 18-90; higher scores suggest greater problems with emotion regulation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) - Teacher</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4-6</time_frame>
    <description>PSS is a 10-question scale that ask about one's feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, the teacher is asked to indicate by circling how often he/she felt or thought a certain way. Each question is reported on a 0 (never) - 4 (very often) scale. The total score range is 0-40; the higher the score, the more frequent one has felt stressed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Anger - Short Form - Parent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4-6</time_frame>
    <description>This 5-item form assesses the pure domain of anger in child as reported by parents. The measure is completed by the parent to rate the severity of the child's anger during the past 7 days. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never to 5=always) with a total score range of 5-25 with higher scores indicating greater severity of anger.</description>

    <description>PD is a school-based evidence-based-intervention (EBI) and preventive service provision model that supports teachers and school personnel to apply EBI strategies to promot young children's medical health in impoverished areas. Teachers and PTAs will participate in a 4-day training before the 1st school term. Teachers in the intervention condition will also receive 8 sessions (8 hours) of face-to-face group-based coaching during the 1st and 2nd terms. Coaching sessions are to help teachers apply EBI strategies in their classrooms, engage families, and develop competencies.</description>
