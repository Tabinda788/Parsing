  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized study of standard of care (SOC) neo-adjuvant cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy (NAC) versus NAC plus durvalumab in patients with either clinical or pathologic&#xD;
      intra-pelvic node-positive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Patients with cTanyN1-3M0 via&#xD;
      American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging30 will be considered tor&#xD;
      enrollment in this trial. We plan to enroll 60 patients. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to&#xD;
      the intervention arm with durvalumab plus NAC vs SOC NAC. In patients randomized to receive,&#xD;
      durvalumab will be continued as maintenance every 4 weeks until either relapse or 1 year,&#xD;
      whichever event occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue collection will occur as a biopsy prior to initiation of neo-adjuvant therapy via both&#xD;
      transurethral biopsy of bladder and lymph node biopsy. Tissue will again be collected at the&#xD;
      time of radical cystectomy or, in patients who are no longer surgical candidates, in the form&#xD;
      of biopsy as standard of care. Blood and urine will be collected at baseline, week 2, week 6,&#xD;
      week 16, and at the 6 week-post surgery visit for analysis of correlative studies.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To estimate the difference in pathologic complete response rate as defined as no evidence&#xD;
      of disease (ypT0N0) or carcinoma in situ within the bladder only (ypTcisN0) in patients after&#xD;
      administration of the combination of dose-dense MVAC and durvalumab versus dose-dense MVAC&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the difference in the rate of patients eligible for surgical consolidation&#xD;
           within 90 days of completion of pre-surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the difference in the proportion of patients with relapse free survival at&#xD;
           12 and 36 months following surgery in each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the difference in overall survival for both arms on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure lymph node response with those with measurable disease via RECIST v1.1&#xD;
           criteria at baseline, week 6, and week 12 on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the toxicity of the combination of dose-dense MVAC chemotherapy and&#xD;
           durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Exploratory biomarkers to study the correlation between immunological and molecular changes&#xD;
      in tumor tissues and peripheral blood with pathologic complete response, time until relapse&#xD;
      and rate of adverse events, with a specific emphasis upon comparison of tissue samples in&#xD;
      patients exposed to combination dose-dense MVAC and durvalumab versus dose-dense MVAC alone&#xD;

             effective methods of contraception are those that alone or in combination, result in a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. These&#xD;
             methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Established use of oral, inserted, or injected or implanted hormonal methods of&#xD;
             contraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment&#xD;
