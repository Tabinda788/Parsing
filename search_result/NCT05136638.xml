  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current research aims to evaluate the adherence and efficacy of dCBTi with different&#xD;
      types of coaching support.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the five conditions. C1: Sleep Hygiene and&#xD;
      Self-Monitoring Control Condition; C2: dCBTi without coaching; C3; dCBTi with virtual&#xD;
      coaching; C4: dCBTi with non-therapist coaching; C5: dCBTi with therapist coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does dCBTi work better than the active control?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in C2, C3, C4, and C5 will have greater improvement in insomnia than those in&#xD;
      C1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does coaching support, virtual or human, improve treatment adherence and outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in C3, C4, and C5 will have greater improvement in insomnia and greater&#xD;
      adherence to treatment recommendations than those in C2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does human coaching enhance treatment adherence and outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in C4 and C5 will have greater improvement in primary outcome than those in C3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does therapist-coaching-support enhance treatment adherence and outcome to a greater extent&#xD;
      than virtual and non-therapist coaching support?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in C5 will have greater improvement in primary outcome than those in C3 and C4.&#xD;
