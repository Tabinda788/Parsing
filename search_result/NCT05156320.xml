    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 trial (Study SRK-015-003) is being conducted in patients ≥2 years old at&#xD;
      Screening, who were previously diagnosed with later-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)&#xD;
      (i.e., Type 2 and Type 3 SMA) and are receiving an approved survival motor neuron (SMN)&#xD;
      upregulator therapy (i.e., either nusinersen or risdiplam), to confirm the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of apitegromab as an adjunctive therapy to nusinersen and evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of apitegromab as an adjunctive therapy to risdiplam.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must be Nonambulatory at Screening. Nonambulatory patients must be able to sit&#xD;
             independently (sits up straight with head erect for at least 10 seconds; does not use&#xD;

             motor milestones definition at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving one background therapy for SMA (i.e., either nusinersen or risdiplam) for&#xD;
             the time period specified below and anticipated to remain on that same treatment&#xD;
             throughout the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If receiving the SMN upregulator therapy nusinersen, must have completed at least&#xD;
                  10 months of dosing (i.e., completed the loading regimen and at least 2&#xD;
                  maintenance doses) before Screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If receiving the SMN upregulator therapy risdiplam, must have completed at least&#xD;
                  6 months of dosing before Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Motor Function Score (HFMSE) ≥10 and ≤45 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have no physical limitations that would prevent the patient from undergoing motor&#xD;
             function outcome measures throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to receive study drug infusions and provide blood samples through the use of a&#xD;
             peripheral intravenous (IV) or a long-term IV access device that the patient has&#xD;
             placed for reasons independent from the study throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to adhere to the requirements of the protocol, including travel to the study&#xD;
             center and completing all study procedures and study visits.&#xD;

             study, adhere to study specific contraception requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

             with apitegromab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of invasive ventilation and tracheostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of chronic daytime non-invasive ventilatory support for &gt;16 hours daily in the 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to dosing, or anticipated to regularly receive such daytime ventilator&#xD;
             support chronically over the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any acute or co-morbid condition interfering with the well-being of the patient within&#xD;
             7 days of screening, including active systemic infection, the need for acute treatment&#xD;

             scoliosis or contractures present must be stable over the past 6 months, anticipated&#xD;
             to be stable for the duration of the study and not prevent the patient from being&#xD;
             evaluated on any functional outcome measures throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major orthopedic or other interventional procedure, including spine or hip surgery,&#xD;
             considered to have the potential to substantially limit the ability of the patient to&#xD;
             be evaluated on any functional outcome measures, within 6 months prior to Screening,&#xD;
             or anticipated for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of a hypersensitivity reaction to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) or&#xD;
             recombinant protein bearing an Fc domain (such as a soluble receptor-Fc fusion&#xD;
             protein), apitegromab, or excipients of apitegromab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with investigational drugs within 3 months prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of therapies with potentially significant muscle effects (such as androgens,&#xD;
             insulin-like growth factor, growth hormone, systemic beta-agonist, botulinum toxin, or&#xD;
             muscle relaxants or muscle-enhancing supplements) or potentially significant&#xD;
             neuromuscular effects (such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) within 60 days prior&#xD;
             to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nutritional status not stable over the past 6 months and not anticipated to be stable&#xD;
             throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any other condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator may&#xD;
             compromise safety or compliance, would preclude the patient from successful completion&#xD;
             of the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results.&#xD;
