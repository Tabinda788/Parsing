  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of bariatric surgery vs&#xD;
      medical weight loss to optimize a morbidly obese patient with end-stage osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      hip or knee joint for total joint arthroplasty (TJA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include patients with hip or knee joint osteoarthritis and BMI&#xD;
      (Body Mass Index) &gt; 40 kg/m2 who are evaluated in the joint arthroplasty clinic at Boston&#xD;
      Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if bariatric surgery or medical weight&#xD;
      loss is more effective in optimizing a morbidly obese patient with osteoarthritis of the hip&#xD;
      or knee joint for TJA. This will be determined by comparing the number of patients within&#xD;
      each group who are able to lose weight through either bariatric surgery or medical weight&#xD;
      loss to achieve a BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2 to eventually undergo TJA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare total operative time, postoperative&#xD;
      complication rates, readmission rates, percentage of total body weight lost, revision rate,&#xD;
      and reoperation rate. The ability of patients within each study arm to maintain a BMI ≤ 40&#xD;
      kg/m2 for up to 2 years after undergoing TJA will also be assessed, as well as their level of&#xD;
      satisfaction before and after being in the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective RCT, eligible participants will be randomized to undergo either the&#xD;
      bariatric surgery or medical weight loss intervention and their progress will be monitored&#xD;
      during visits by registered dieticians and medical nutritionists. Participants will also have&#xD;
      telemedicine visits with an arthroplasty physician assistant every 3 months to ensure they&#xD;
      are making progress in terms of weight loss and becoming a safer candidate for TJA.&#xD;
      Participants will complete research surveys every 3 months during the telemedicine visits to&#xD;
      provide feedback regarding their overall satisfaction with their weight loss and if any&#xD;
      individualized changes need to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study participant has achieved a BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2, they will undergo TJA and will be&#xD;
      seen postoperatively in the arthroplasty clinic for routine follow up visits. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to complete patient research surveys every 3 months via telemedicine for up to 2&#xD;
      years to provide feedback regarding how they are managing with their weight loss after&#xD;
      undergoing TJA.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will have a telemedicine visit every 3 months with an orthopaedic surgery physician assistant to review their latest BMI and to complete a patient research survey to assess the patient's feelings regarding their progress. The telemedicine visits every 3 months are unique to the clinical trial and these visits would not otherwise occur if the patient was not enrolled in the trial. If patients are found to not be advancing toward the BMI goal of ≤ 40 kg/m2, these patient research surveys can be used to make individualized adjustments, based on recommendations from dieticians and the medical nutritionist.</description>
