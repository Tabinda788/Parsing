      This study is a single arm, single center and exploratory clinical study, which aims to&#xD;
      explore the efficacy and safety of hetropapa ethanolamine tablets in the treatment of&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia caused by concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy of cervical cancer. The&#xD;
      primary end point was the proportion of subjects who were effective after treatment with&#xD;
      hetropapa in the first cycle after treatment, that is, the platelet value recovered to ≥ 100&#xD;
      x 109 / L after treatment. The main inclusion criteria were: voluntary participation in the&#xD;
      trial and signing informed consent; Age ≥ 18 years old, regardless of gender; Cervical cancer&#xD;
      was diagnosed by histopathology or cytology; Platelet &lt; 75 × 109/L； At the time of screening,&#xD;
      the expected survival time is ≥ 12 weeks, and can be treated with the current chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen for at least 1 cycle.&#xD;

             years old, regardless of gender; Cervical cancer was diagnosed by histopathology or&#xD;
             cytology; Platelet &lt; 75 × 109/L At the time of screening, the expected survival time&#xD;
             is ≥ 12 weeks, and can be treated with the current chemotherapy regimen for at least 1&#xD;
             cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening or baseline platelet value &lt; 30 × 109/L Suffering from the following&#xD;
             hematopoietic system diseases other than thrombocytopenia (CIT) caused by tumor&#xD;
             chemotherapy drugs, including but not limited to leukemia, primary immune&#xD;
             thrombocytopenia, bone marrow proliferative diseases, multiple myeloma and&#xD;
             myelodysplastic syndrome; Thrombocytopenia caused by causes other than CIT occurred&#xD;
             within 6 months before screening, including but not limited to chronic liver disease,&#xD;
             hypersplenism, infection and bleeding; Clinical manifestations of severe bleeding&#xD;
             within 2 weeks before screening, such as gastrointestinal tract or central nervous&#xD;
