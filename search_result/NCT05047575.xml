  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests a novel, risk-stratified approach for low risk breast cancer survivor&#xD;
      follow-up care that reduces burden for survivors and their oncologists while simultaneously&#xD;
      delivering more comprehensive care. The intervention is called Remote Electronic Assessment&#xD;
      of Survivors with Feedback Communication and Directed Referrals (REASSURE). 50 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled into 2 cohorts, 25 into cohort 1 who will experience the REASSURE&#xD;
      intervention 6 months from enrollment and 25 into cohort 2 who will experience components of&#xD;
      the REASSURE intervention at their next follow-up visit. Participants can expect to be on&#xD;
      study for up to 9 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current follow-up care for 3 million+ breast cancer survivors is both burdensome and fails to&#xD;
      comprehensively address survivors' needs. Survivors and oncologists value these visits&#xD;
      because visits reassure survivors about recurrence, and support oncologists' views about&#xD;
      their responsibilities for managing ongoing therapy. However, early-stage survivors derive&#xD;
      less benefit from follow-up, while incurring substantial financial burdens. Further,&#xD;
      follow-up visit time restraints prevent addressing all topics prioritized by survivors or&#xD;
      recommended as comprehensive survivorship care. Because most low-risk breast cancer survivors&#xD;
      will never experience a recurrence, there is a critical need to develop a novel,&#xD;
      risk-stratified approach to follow-up that reduces burden for survivors and their oncologists&#xD;
      while simultaneously delivering more comprehensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this gap, the team engaged stakeholders to develop an intervention for low-risk&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors, called Remote Electronic Assessment of Survivors with Feedback&#xD;
      Communication and Directed Referrals (REASSURE). REASSURE maintains one annual in-person&#xD;
      oncology visit, consistent with stakeholder preferences for oncology-based follow-up.&#xD;
      REASSURE utilizes remote patient-reported outcomes assessments to comprehensively assess&#xD;
      symptoms, promotes practice change by providing feedback reports to oncologists and engaging&#xD;
      primary care providers (PCPs) in survivorship care, and reduces the burden of follow-up by&#xD;
      substituting an oncology visit for thriving survivors with reassurance messaging and&#xD;
      encouragement to pursue preventive care. The investigators have successfully pilot tested the&#xD;
      PRO assessment and estimate that 25% of low-risk breast cancer survivors will have symptoms&#xD;
      requiring a follow-up visit with medical oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot feasibility study, the REASSURE intervention will be implemented into clinical&#xD;
      care for the first time. Eligible survivors will be recruited and use mixed methods to&#xD;
      accomplish four study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 1. Assess the feasibility of implementing REASSURE into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 2. Determine the number of survivorship symptoms/concerns that were addressed&#xD;
           during the follow-up visit following clinician review of the REASSURE PRO assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 3. Characterize the impact of REASSURE on healthcare utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 4. Assess concordance between the referral recommendation generated from the&#xD;
           PRO assessment and medical oncologist opinion.&#xD;
