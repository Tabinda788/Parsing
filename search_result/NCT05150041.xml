  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated by many different researches that for patients to work on their&#xD;
      lifestyle modifications, it is important that the patients know their exact blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. Unlike the HbA1c which can only be determined at the hospital, improvements in blood&#xD;
      glucose levels were detected in both the Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients who use insulin as&#xD;
      well as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients with SMBG(self-monitoring of blood glucose) which&#xD;
      is the method used by patients to measure the blood glucose level at home on their own. Where&#xD;
      SMBG needed blood to be collected from the fingertips, it has now passed the continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring(CGM) stage where blood drawing is no longer required and is now replaced&#xD;
      by the real-time CGM(RT-CGM) where blood glucose level can be checked real time. Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus patients who do not use preprandial rapid insulin were divided into SMBG&#xD;
      group and intermittent RT-CGM user group and their blood glucose level decrease monitored for&#xD;
      3 months. After 3 months, HbA1c in SMBG group decreased 0.5% compared to the baseline while&#xD;
      1.0% decreased in RT-CGM group. The research was extended 40 weeks to make the total research&#xD;
      period to 52 weeks and the results still showed that there were significant decrease in the&#xD;
      RT-CGM group. However, up to this day, there are no researches that can show that there are&#xD;
      additional decrease in the blood glucose level in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients with use&#xD;
      of RT-CGM in the group where sufficient blood glucose management cannot be achieved through&#xD;
      use of three oral drug combination therapy to lower the blood glucose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research seeks to find out if there are any decreases in the blood glucose level by&#xD;
      using RT-CGM at 6 month period in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitu patient group whose blood glucose&#xD;
      level cannot significantly be managed after the three oral hypoglycemic agent combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
