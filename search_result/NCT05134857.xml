  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of zonisamide (ZON) to decrease alcohol use among treatment-seeking adults with an&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder (AUD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project focuses on the efficacy of a promising pharmacotherapy (ZON) for AUDs using a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled design that will rigorously measure alcohol use and medication adherence.&#xD;
      Results will guide novel mechanistic targets to better capture the heterogeneity within AUDs.&#xD;
      This project will evaluate the ability of ZON to treat the alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the group assigned to ZON associated with the standard&#xD;
      treatment (ZON+ST) will yield lower rates of biochemically verified alcohol use, fewer&#xD;
      self-reported drinks per day, and fewer heavy drinking days during the 12-week treatment and&#xD;
      1-year follow-up periods, relative to the placebo associated with the standard treatment&#xD;
      (PLO+ST) group.&#xD;

    <description>The ZON will be supplied in 100 mg capsules and deposited directly into the TAD device by research staff every 2 weeks. All participants will be told to take 100 mg/day for the first three weeks (Week 1-2 single-blind, placebo-only, induction; end of Week 2, active treatment begins) and increasing by 100 mg/day every other week (Week 4: 200 mg/day; Week 6: 300 mg/day; Week 8: 400 mg/day) up to the target dose of 500 mg/day by Week 10. The participants will be maintained on this dose through Week 14 of active treatment and then tapered off ZON (2 weeks). This dosing schedule is consistent with best practices for ZON. All TAD devices will only dispense the prescribed medication between 4pm and 11pm each night. Participants will be instructed to take the medication at or near bedtime.</description>
