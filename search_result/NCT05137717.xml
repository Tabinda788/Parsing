  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to check if treatment with maribavir can protect Japanese people&#xD;
      against Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and to check side effect from the study treatment&#xD;
      and how much maribavir participants can take without getting side effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Japanese recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or solid organ transplant&#xD;
      (SOT) will take Maribavir tablets two times a day for 8 weeks in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will visit their study clinic 18 times as a maximum.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Confirmed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Viremia Clearance (Clearance of Plasma CMV DNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed CMV viremia clearance will be defined as plasma CMV DNA concentration below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to be determined depending on the selected central specialty laboratory, in 2 consecutive postbaseline samples, separated by at least 5 days.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs will be defined as those with a start date on or after the first dose of study treatment, or with a start date before the date of first dose of study treatment but increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment. An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. It does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product (including an investigational product for a new indication in Japan), whether or not related to the pharmaceutical product.</description>

&#xD;
         11. Have active malignancy with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, as determined by&#xD;
