  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Do very elderly adults wish intensive care in the event of acute life-threatening illness and&#xD;
      are their next of kin able to predict these preferences?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very elderly patients are a steeply increasing patient population in intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICUs), but the overall benefit of intensive care for these patients remains controversial.&#xD;
      Will ICU admission improve survival and quality of life, or will it prolong suffering and&#xD;
      delay natural death? Little is known about very elderly Norwegians life sustaining treatment&#xD;
      (LST) preferences in these situations where treatment benefit is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to improve critically ill very elderly patients' ICU trajectories by&#xD;
      bringing forth knowledge about their treatment preferences, their family members' ability to&#xD;
      predict these preferences, and by directing attention to the challenges of consent to&#xD;
      critical care in cases of medical uncertainty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A selv administered, mailed survey will be distributed among 400 outpatients aged 80 years or&#xD;
      older and their next of kin. Respondents will be recruited at the ophthalmologic,&#xD;
      ear-nose-and-throat and orthopaedic outpatient clinics at Haukeland University Hospital&#xD;
      Bergen, Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed and validated a survey tool for this purpose, containing 3&#xD;
      hypothetical scenarios of acute life-threatening illness. The scenarios are randomly chosen&#xD;
      from 20 hypothetical patient histories and are representative for ICU admission diagnoses in&#xD;
      Norway and Europe. The participants will be asked for treatment choices, i.e. wishing&#xD;
      admission to intensive care or not. A response option 'not wishing to engage in the treatment&#xD;
      decision' is also provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the questionnaire includes factors that may influence elderlies' treatment&#xD;
      preferences and proxies' ability to predict these preferences including: demographics,&#xD;
      religion, previous experience with and / or communication about critical illness,&#xD;
      comorbidity, frailty, quality of life, and projections (i.e. the proxy's own treatment&#xD;
      preferences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respondents are requested to explain their choices by free-text comments after each&#xD;
      scenario. They are also asked to elaborate how they wish next-of-kin should contribute to&#xD;
      decision making in these cases. Additional space for free-text comments is provided in the&#xD;
      end of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is exploratory. Responses will be analysed with both quantitative statistics&#xD;
      and qualitative methods.&#xD;
