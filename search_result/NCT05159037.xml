  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines whether musical tracks played during gaze contingent music reward therapy&#xD;
      (GC-MRT) for social anxiety could later be used as a booster to reduce anxiety before a&#xD;
      stressful situation. To this end, highly socially anxious participants will undergo 4 GC-MRT&#xD;
      sessions designed to train participants' attention away from threat and towards neutral&#xD;
      social stimuli. Subsequently, participants will be asked to perform a socially stressful&#xD;
      speech task. Prior to the speech, half of the participants will listen to a musical track&#xD;
      they were trained with, and half of the participants will listen to a musical track they like&#xD;
      but were not trained with during the GC-MRT sessions. We expect that listening to musical&#xD;
      track taken from the GC-MRT sessions will moderate the increase in anxiety levels prior to&#xD;
      the speech and will improve performance during the speech compared to a non-trained musical&#xD;
      track.&#xD;

      Gaze contingent music reward therapy (GC-MRT) is designed to modify threat-related attention&#xD;
      biases through operational conditioning between beloved music and gaze patterns favoring&#xD;
      neutral stimuli over threat-related stimuli. GC-MRT has shown efficacy in reducing social&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms. The current study is designed to explore whether the musical tracks played&#xD;
      during the GC-MRT conditioning could be later used as a treatment booster to reduce anxiety&#xD;
      in a socially stressful situation. To this end, 60 high socially anxious participants will&#xD;
      undergo four GC-MRT sessions and then will be asked to perform a stressful speech task. Prior&#xD;
      to the speech, half of the participants (randomly determined) will listen to a musical track&#xD;
      they were trained with, and half of the participants will listen to a musical track they like&#xD;
      but were not trained with during GC-MRT sessions. We expect that the listening to musical&#xD;
      track taken from the GC-MRT sessions will moderate the increase in anxiety levels prior to&#xD;
      the speech and will improve performance during the speech compared to a non-trained musical&#xD;
      track.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline - the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale - Self Reported Version</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days before intervention, 4-10 days after intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>The LSAS is a 24-item scale, each item corresponding to a situation selected on the basis of clinical experience. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3 with regard to the passing week, measuring separately two components of social anxiety, specifically, fear/anxiety and avoidance of social interaction and performance situations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline - the Visual Analogue Scale - Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>4-10 days after intervention completion (baseline of the speech session, after introducing the speech task, after listening to a musical track, after preparation to the speech,after the speech is over).</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale Anxiety (VAS-A) measures state anxiety. Participants are instructed to use the computer mouse and place the locator at the scale position representing their current level of anxiety in response to the question, &quot;How anxious do you feel right now?&quot;. The VAS is divided into thirty units from 0 (&quot;calm&quot;) to 30 (&quot;anxious&quot;) while the participants do not see the division into calves and are asked to answer according to their feeling.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSPS (Public Speaking Performance Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-10 days after intervention completion (During speech task)</time_frame>
    <description>The Public Speaking Performance Scale comprises 17 items concerning speech quality. Items are rated by independent judges on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores denote worse performance.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline - viewing patterns on threat-neutral face matrices</measure>
    <time_frame>At the first day of intervention, 4-10 days after intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>Gaze patterns, and specifically attention allocation to threat will be used as moderators for clinical outcome, as well as indicators of target engagement.</description>
