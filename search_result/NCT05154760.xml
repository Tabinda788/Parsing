      Telerehabilitation (TR) refers to the provision of rehabilitation services through&#xD;
      information and communication technologies. The most widely used of these technologies are&#xD;
      applications such as telephone and video conferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary incontinence is defined as involuntary urinary incontinence ). This condition, which&#xD;
      affects both sexes, is more common in women. Urinary incontinence is caused by dysfunction in&#xD;
      the bladder and pelvic floor muscles in women during menopause, childbirth, or pregnancy.&#xD;
      Urinary incontinence is a health problem that significantly affects people's social&#xD;
      interactions, interests, and psychosocial status. It has been shown that even mild&#xD;
      incontinence complaints cause a decrease in the quality of life in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor muscle training is one of the conservative treatment methods used in the&#xD;
      treatment of urinary incontinence.Adding breathing exercises and deep abdominal muscle&#xD;
      strengthening exercises to pelvic floor muscle training may be beneficial in patients with&#xD;
      urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with urinary incontinence, women who are in regular communication with the&#xD;
      supervisor during pelvic floor muscle training are more likely to gain higher from the&#xD;
      program. However, it has not been shown that group physiotherapy is less effective than&#xD;
      physiotherapy administered individually in reducing incontinence episodes. In the light of&#xD;
      this information in the literature, our research hypothesis is that in patients with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, follow-up the pelvic floor muscle training, breathing exercise, and core&#xD;
      exercise training with individually video conference method can have positive effects on&#xD;
      patients' muscle strength, incontinence degree, quality of life, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      exercise adherence, and sexual function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic in the world, telerehabilitation methods are widely used in&#xD;
      order to ensure the continuity of patients' access to health services, as well as to reduce&#xD;
      the likelihood of both health personnel and the patient catching the disease.&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation (TR) refers to the provision of rehabilitation services through&#xD;
      information and communication technologies. Information and communication technologies&#xD;
      include secure messaging services and e-mail services, but new applications such as&#xD;
      wearables, virtual reality and activity trackers are increasingly used in healthcare. On the&#xD;
      other hand, real-time applications, where information is instantly exchanged between all&#xD;
      users by telephone and video conferencing, are the most common of information and&#xD;
      communication technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary incontinence is defined as the complaint of involuntary urinary incontinence. This&#xD;
      condition, which affects both sexes, is more common in women. Urinary incontinence is caused&#xD;
      by the disruption of the continence mechanism as a result of prostate enlargement or prostate&#xD;
      cancer in men; In women, it is due to dysfunction in the bladder and pelvic floor muscles&#xD;
      that occur during menopause, childbirth or pregnancy. urinary incontinence; It is classified&#xD;
      as stress incontinence, urge incontinence, mixed type incontinence, overflow incontinence and&#xD;
      functional incontinence. In a study conducted in our country, it was reported that stress&#xD;
      type incontinence is the most common type of incontinence. Stress type incontinence is&#xD;
      followed by mixed type incontinence and urge type incontinence, respectively. Urinary&#xD;
      incontinence is a health problem that significantly affects people's social interactions,&#xD;
      interests and psychosocial status. Studies have shown that even mild incontinence complaints&#xD;
      cause a decrease in the quality of life in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatment, pharmacological treatment and surgical interventions are used in the&#xD;
      treatment of urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training is one of the conservative&#xD;
      treatment methods used in the treatment of urinary incontinence. Studies in the literature&#xD;
      have reported that pelvic floor muscle training should be included in the primary care&#xD;
      program in women with stress or any type of incontinence, and this training causes less&#xD;
      urinary incontinence, less urine in the pad test, and patients empty their bladders less&#xD;
      frequently during the day. It has been shown that the pelvic floor muscles work&#xD;
      synergistically with the diaphragm and abdominal muscles to control respiration and changes&#xD;
      in intra-abdominal pressure. Therefore, it has been reported in the literature that adding&#xD;
      breathing exercises and deep abdominal muscle strengthening exercises to pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      training in patients with urinary incontinence may be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the studies are examined, the programs that include pelvic floor muscle training are&#xD;
      quite variable. Different methods were used in order to increase the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      applied muscle training program and the adherence of the patients to the program. One of&#xD;
      these applied methods is telerehabilitation applications. It has been shown that pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle training can be applied safely and effectively with telehealth applications, and&#xD;
      significant improvements are achieved in stress incontinence and mixed type incontinence&#xD;
      types with these applications. It has been reported that these technological methods are&#xD;
      advantageous in order to ensure continuity of treatment without leaving the house during the&#xD;
      pandemic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with regular contact with the supervisor during pelvic floor muscle training in&#xD;
      patients with urinary incontinence are more likely to report their recovery. However, group&#xD;
      physiotherapy has not been shown to be less effective than individual physiotherapy in&#xD;
      reducing incontinence episodes. In the light of this information in the literature, pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscle training, breathing exercise and core exercises performed individually with&#xD;
      video conference monitoring, which is one of the telerehabilitation methods in patients with&#xD;
      urinary incontinence, on muscle strength, incontinence degree, pelvic floor muscle thickness,&#xD;
      symptoms on quality of life, patient satisfaction, exercise. We have established our&#xD;
      hypothesis in terms of positive effects on commitment and sexual life. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      this study is; The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of group video&#xD;
      conferencing method and individual video conferencing method on urinary incontinence in&#xD;
      patients with urinary incontinence.&#xD;
