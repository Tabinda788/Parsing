      Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is an increasingly performed procedure for acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis (AC), safe and less invasive than laparoscopic cholecystectomy, very useful in&#xD;
      selected patients (severe comorbidities, not suitable for surgery/general anesthesia,..) The&#xD;
      investigators conduct a retrospective observational study. Period: 2016-2021. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: Patients treated with PC for AC. Tokyo guidelines TG13/18 the investigators&#xD;
      algorithm to treat AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of the sample undergoing Percutaneous Cholecystostomy, main indications,&#xD;
      evolution and clinical results were reported in an initial observational study. Subsequently,&#xD;
      a retrospective analytical study was designed to compare various cohorts: lithiasic vs&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the gold standard for the treatment of acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis (AC). Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is an increasingly performed procedure&#xD;
      for AC, safe and less invasive than LC, very useful in selected patients (severe&#xD;
      comorbidities, not suitable for surgery/general anesthesia,..).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical advantages offered by PC are the rapid resolution of sepsis and the optimal&#xD;
      preparation of the patient for elective LC . Its main drawback is the possibility of&#xD;
      recurrence of AC or other biliary events while awaiting LC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, many questions about PC remain unanswered: how should the catheter be handled and&#xD;
      removed? When is the best time to perform LC? Should cholecystectomy be offered to all&#xD;
      patients after PC? Does PC complicate subsequent cholecystectomy? How good is the adherence&#xD;
      to the Tokyo Guidelines in real life? To answer these questions, the investigators devised&#xD;
      the present study involving patients undergoing PC at the investigators center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were: patients undergoing PC diagnosed with AC following the TG13 and&#xD;
      TG18 diagnostic criteria. The exclusion criteria were: patients undergoing PC for causes&#xD;
      other than AC, such as neoplasms, bile duct alterations or non-therapeutic diagnostic&#xD;
      purposes; patients who had previously undergone endoscopic drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of the sample undergoing PC, main indications, evolution and clinical&#xD;
      results were reported in an initial observational study. Subsequently, a retrospective&#xD;
      analytical study was designed to compare various cohorts: lithiasic vs alithiasic AC,&#xD;
      elective vs emergency surgery or management with PC alone. Patients' main characteristics,&#xD;
      associated morbidity (complications according to Clavien-Dindo grade (CD) and 90-day&#xD;
      mortality, need for new drain placement, and surgical approach (laparoscopic vs. open) were&#xD;
      compared, following the STROCSS 2019 guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables were compiled from a review of the digitized medical histories which included one&#xD;
      year of follow-up. The demographic variables studied were age and sex. Functional status was&#xD;
      assessed according to the ASA scale and comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index&#xD;
      (CCI). The type of radiological test used in the diagnosis (ultrasound, computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT), nuclear magnetic resonance, cholangioresonance or a combination of these) and&#xD;
      laboratory tests (C-reactive protein and leukocyte count) were recorded. Marked local&#xD;
      inflammation was defined as gangrenous or emphysematous AC, biliary perforation/peritonitis,&#xD;
      or perivesical abscess. Each patient was classified according to the TG13/18 severity scale:&#xD;
      Grade I (mild), Grade II (moderate) or Grade III (severe). The degree of adherence to the&#xD;
      TG13/18 was taken into account in the indication of PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main indications for PC, total length of hospitalization, time from admission to drainage&#xD;
      placement, and drainage duration in days were recorded. The procedure was considered&#xD;
      successful when the patient did not require a new drain or emergency surgery, did not die due&#xD;
      to the infection, and could be discharged from hospital after PC removal. Even though PC is&#xD;
      not a surgical intervention, the Clavien-Dindo complication scale was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who underwent cholecystectomy and those placed on the surgical waiting list were&#xD;
      recorded, as was the type of surgery (emergency vs elective). In the case of emergency&#xD;
      surgery the reason for the intervention was also reported. Approach, conversion rate to open&#xD;
      surgery, total length of hospitalization, time from PC to cholecystectomy (in days), and&#xD;
      finally complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were assessed. Ninety-day&#xD;
      mortality rates of patients both after PC and after cholecystectomy were recorded, as well as&#xD;
      the causes. As regards clinical evolution, readmission rates for biliary causes (AC, biliary&#xD;
      colic, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis and/or pancreatitis) and other causes were reported,&#xD;
      along with time until readmission and main reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the general assessment (physical examination, complementary tests and clinical status)&#xD;
      the surgical team decided whether to proceed with PC or perform emergency surgery. The PC was&#xD;
      placed by interventional radiologists. The technique was performed under local anesthesia in&#xD;
      aseptic conditions, guided by ultrasound or CT. Ultrasound-guided transhepatic PC using the&#xD;
      Seldinger technique was the usual procedure. Prior to removal, a cholangiography was&#xD;
      performed through the catheter in order to check its patency and the passage of the contrast&#xD;
      into the duodenum. In some cases, the drain was closed for 24-48 hours to assess tolerance&#xD;
      before removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency cholecystectomy was performed by the oncall surgical team. If a laparoscopic&#xD;
      approach was chosen, it was carried out using the French technique, with dissection of&#xD;
      Calot's triangle until the Strasberg critical view of safety was achieved. If an open&#xD;
      approach was selected or if conversion from laparoscopic surgery proved necessary, it was&#xD;
      carried out via right subcostal laparotomy.&#xD;
