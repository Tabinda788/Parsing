      This was a retrospective case-control study designed and conducted under the approval of the&#xD;
      ethic committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All patients with gastric cancer&#xD;
      referring to Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, during&#xD;
      February 25th and December 25th 2020, were enrolled to the study. February 25th was the day&#xD;
      Ministry of Health and Medical Education announced COVID-19 as a national disaster and set&#xD;
      restrictive rules of social distancing. The control group consisted of the gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients whom referred to Cancer Institute during February 25th and December 25th of 2019. So&#xD;
      we compared two groups of gastric cancer patients one in the era of COVID-19 pandemic and&#xD;
      other group from previous year when there was no COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer Institute as the pioneer of cancer management in Iran set institutional regulation for&#xD;
      hospitalization of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic with the primary goal of&#xD;
      delivering the best available treatment as timely as possible. In order to achieve this, each&#xD;
      patient regardless of cancer type must had proceeded these steps before elective&#xD;
      hospitalization and during preoperative, operation and postoperative days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to hospitalization, patients were referred to infectious disease clinic, where&#xD;
           they were visited by attending infectious disease specialists who had fellowship in&#xD;
           infectious disease of immunocompromised and transplanted patients. Every patient&#xD;
           monitored for COVID-19 sign and symptoms and those with high susceptibility were&#xD;
           examined utilizing spiral chest computed tomography scan (SCCT) and polymerase chain&#xD;
           reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. If a patient had positive result of either SCCT or PCR,&#xD;
           he/she was managed either in outpatient or inpatient setting for COVID-19 treatment&#xD;
           based on national protocol and subsequent cancer management was postponed. If it was&#xD;
           confirmed that patient is eligible for hospitalization and entering operation room,&#xD;
           he/she was admitted to surgical oncology ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During pre-operative days, all patients were hospitalized in single or double bed room,&#xD;
           family members were not allowed to accompany except for under legal aged patient and&#xD;
           those who need special attention because of the low performance status. All patients&#xD;
           were educated about COVID-19 transmission routs and preventive measures and asked to&#xD;
           respect social distancing, wear facial mask and wash hands using alcohol- based&#xD;
           antiseptic formulas given. Each patient underwent daily monitoring for sign and symptoms&#xD;
           of COVID-19, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and oxygen saturation by&#xD;
           commercially available pulse oximetry devices. In case of developing signs and symptoms&#xD;
           related to COVID-19 or unexplained temperature &gt; 38°C, oxygen saturation &lt; 93% or &gt; 5&#xD;
           unit drop in oxygen saturation from the baseline, infectious disease consultation was&#xD;
           ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During operation time, the minimum number of personnel needed to activate a safe&#xD;
           operation environment whom were fully equipped with personal preventive clothing&#xD;
           including surgical cap, gown, facial mask and shield were present at the theater. The&#xD;
           operation theater was well ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. During post-operative days, for both intensive care unit and ward patient, daily&#xD;
           monitoring of signs and symptoms related to COVID-19 besides unexplained temperature &gt;&#xD;
           38°C, oxygen saturation &lt; 93% or &gt; 5 unit drop in oxygen saturation from the baseline,&#xD;
           C-Reactive Protein Level &gt; 40 persistent for 3 days activated infectious disease&#xD;
           consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of both case and control group were enrolled to the study as if they gave written&#xD;
      consent of participation, had confirmed gastric cancer using esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and&#xD;
      pathologically proven biopsy and spiral thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography scan&#xD;
      prior to surgery. All patients became candidates to undergo staging laparoscopy (SL) in order&#xD;
      to investigate local and peritoneal invasion of the tumor based on National Comprehensive&#xD;
      Cancer Network guideline for gastric cancer 2020. Patients with following criteria were&#xD;
      excluded from the study; radiological evidence of metastatic disease, current or previous&#xD;
      history of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients of both groups underwent SL by the same two attending onco-surgeon, using the&#xD;
      same technique and the same laparoscopic device. Under general anesthesia and in supine&#xD;
      position SL was performed. A 10 mm optic laparoscopic port was inserted via the midline&#xD;
      incision below the umbilicus using Hasson technique. All four quadrants of the abdomen as&#xD;
      well as pelvis were inspected during laparoscopy and biopsy was taken from any suspicious&#xD;
      lesion through insertion of 5mm port. All specimens underwent cytological evaluation by two&#xD;
      independent pathologists. The presence of any malignant cells, regardless of the number,&#xD;
      confirmed the positive cytology. In the event of discordant reports between two pathologists,&#xD;
      specimens were sent for the third review by a pathologist who was blinded to the previous&#xD;
      results. Laparoscopic evaluation was considered positive as if adjacent organ involvement,&#xD;
      omental involvement or peritoneal seeding were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected on the following variables: age, gender, tumor location, gastric lesion&#xD;
      pathology and clinical stage based on the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on&#xD;
      Cancer tumor-node metastasis staging system for gastric cancer[16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables are shown as number and relative frequency. Also, continuous variables&#xD;
      are shown as mean ± SD. Collected data for categorical variables were compared using the&#xD;
      chi-squared test. An independent student t-test was used to compare means between the two&#xD;
      groups. All analyses were performed by the two-sided method using Statistical Package of&#xD;
      Social Science software (SPSS version 22; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL), and the p-value of &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      was set as statistically signiﬁcant.&#xD;
