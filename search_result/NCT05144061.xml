    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to determine the dose limited toxicity(DLT) and maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose(MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose(RP2D) of HRS2398 in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      malignant tumor ; The second objectives is to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy and PK&#xD;
      profile of HRS2398 in subjects with advanced malignant tumor ; Exploratory cohort is to&#xD;
      explore the relationship between gene mutation and efficacy and resistance mechanisms.&#xD;
