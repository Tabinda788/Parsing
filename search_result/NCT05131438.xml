      This program is intended to provide access to sugemalimab for participants with R/R ENKTL,&#xD;
      after their disease failed to respond to prior treatment regimen(s), preceding marketing&#xD;
      authorization by the local regulatory agency.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants are eligible to receive sugemalimab as part of this EAP only if all the&#xD;
        following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must be 18 to 99 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants who have a histologically confirmed ENKTL. Both nasal and non-nasal ENKTL&#xD;
             are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must have R/R ENKTL that has progressed on or after asparaginase-based&#xD;
             chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. (Relapse: disease progression after response to the&#xD;
             last treatment; refractory: no response to the last treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), as defined in Section 13.3 must have a&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test ≤7 days before the first dose of sugemalimab. WOCBP or&#xD;
             fertile men and their WOCBP partners must agree to use an effective contraceptive&#xD;
             method from providing signed ICF through 6 months after the last dose of the&#xD;
             sugemalimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations&#xD;
             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants are not eligible to participate in the Sugemalimab ENKTL EAP if any of the&#xD;
        following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with aggressive natural killer cell leukemia or ENKTL participants who&#xD;
             have any degree of leukemic involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects requiring systemic corticosteroid or any other immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
             (Subjects are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal and&#xD;
             inhaled corticosteroids [with minimal systemic absorption]; a short course [≤ 7 days]&#xD;
             of corticosteroids for prophylaxis [e.g., hypersensitivity to contrast media] or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions [e.g., delayed hypersensitivity caused by&#xD;
             contacting allergens])&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with underlying condition that in the treating physician's opinion would&#xD;
             increase the risk of AEs related to sugemalimab administration or confound the&#xD;
             assessment for its toxicity. Participants who have had prior chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, biological therapy (including cancer vaccine, cytokine therapy or&#xD;
             growth factors to treat cancer) used as a systemic treatment for cancer will require&#xD;
             28 days of washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any liver function panel analyte (LFT) value &gt; 2.5 × upper limits of normal reference&#xD;
             range (ULN) which includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) at baseline.&#xD;
             Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any positive test for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating acute or&#xD;
             chronic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants in the treating physician's opinion are not suitable for participating in&#xD;
             this EAP.&#xD;
