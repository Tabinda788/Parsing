  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is independently related to low birth weight, low birth length and small&#xD;
      head circumference. SGA children who have not experienced height and / or head circumference&#xD;
      catch-up have the worst cognitive function. The serum IGF-1 level of short SGA children is&#xD;
      significantly lower than that of catch-up SGA children. This may be due to the defect of&#xD;
      GH-IGF-1 axis, resulting in some hGH / IGF-1 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GH treatment can induce catch-up growth of head circumference, especially for those with&#xD;
      small birth head circumference, growth hormone can help to improve IQ, behavior and self&#xD;
      cognition of children with SGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two years after birth is the most critical period for children's physical, neurological,&#xD;
      cognitive and emotional development. This study evaluated the effect of growth hormone&#xD;
      treatment on the improvement of cognitive function and growth and development of symmetrical&#xD;
      SGA children who did not show catch-up growth from 6 months to 2 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an innovative study. The minimum age of previous similar studies is 19 months. The&#xD;
      starting age of this study is 6 months, and the results are to improve the cognitive&#xD;
      development of SGA infants. This is the first of its kind. Although the safety of growth&#xD;
      hormone in SGA infants younger than 2 years old has not been reported, it is based on a&#xD;
      number of studies on the application of growth hormone in infants, such as PWS and GHD, It&#xD;
      can be expected that there will be no short-term and long-term adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in 17 hospitals led by Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical&#xD;
      College of Huazhong University of science and technology&#xD;

      Subjects: SGA children from 6 months to 2 years old who meet the enrollment conditions shall&#xD;
      be informed of the enrollment by the researcher and the subject's guardian, and the subject's&#xD;
      guardian shall decide to participate in the test drug group or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GH treatment group (n = 68): the subjects were given PEG-rhGH injection 0.2 mg / kg / week&#xD;
      (initial dose), once a week, subcutaneously before going to bed for 104 weeks. Each&#xD;
      follow-up, the researchers adjusted the dosage according to the IGF-1 results of the center&#xD;
      and other individual conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (n = 68): no treatment, only follow-up examination and growth and development&#xD;
      related evaluation, and the follow-up time was 104 Week.&#xD;
