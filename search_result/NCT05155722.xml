      This study is a multicenter, open, dose-increasing and dose-expanding phase I clinical study.&#xD;
      The dose increasing method of &quot;3 + 3&quot; is used to explore the safety, tolerance and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of BAT1308 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      (12-18 cases). After the completion of dose increment, 300mg tolerated doses were selected&#xD;
      for extended research on advanced non-small cell lung cancer, advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma and cervical cancer (80-130 cases), so as to provide recommended doses for&#xD;
      subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;

    <time_frame>126 days after first dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected from all dose groups at specific time points during treatment, and 2mL blood samples were collected at each time point to detect the concentration level of BAT1308 in serum and study the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of BAT1308 injection. PK blood samples were collected from subjects before and after each dosing in cycles 1 to 6. In the first and fourth cycles, intensive sampling was carried out to study PK characteristics of steady-state studies of single administration and multiple administration, respectively.</description>

    <description>All subjects in the dose groups were required to collect blood samples at specific points during treatment, and 3.5ml blood samples were planned for each time point to detect antidrug antibodies in the serum. For blood samples with positive anti-drug antibodies, further testing of titers and neutralizing antibodies is required.</description>

    <time_frame>126 days after first dosing</time_frame>
    <description>The receptor occupancy of BAT1308 injection was studied by detecting PD-1 receptor binding on T cells in peripheral blood. Subjects in all dose groups required blood samples to be collected at specific points during treatment. Pharmacodynamic receptor occupancy studies were performed only in dose-increasing subjects. 2mL blood samples were collected at each time point, and intensive samples were collected before and at the end of the first cycle, 168h and 336h, respectively, and before the second to sixth cycle.</description>

    <measure>Preliminary evaluation of the anti-tumor efficacy of BAT1308 injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>126 days after first dosing</time_frame>
    <description>The antitumor efficacy of BAT1308 was assessed with RECIST1.1 and iRECIST1.1 throughout the trial. Tumor imaging was performed within 28 days prior to initial dosing, and the same imaging technique was used in the same patient at the same site throughout the study period. If there are brain metastases, do head MRI. RECIST 1.1 was used as the main evaluation criterion. Tumor evaluation after dosing was performed at weeks 6 (D42±5), 12 (D84±5), and 18 (D126±5). The extended study tumor assessment was performed every 9 weeks (±7 days) after week 18 until disease progression, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, acceptance of new antitumor therapy, or up to 12 months after initial administration, whichever occurred first.</description>

    <description>First Phase: dose escalation study. It was divided into three dose groups: 100mg, 300mg and 600mg. The safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of BAT1308 injection were explored according to the 3+3 dose increasing mode. It is expected that 12-18 cases will be included in the group. Second Phase: dose expansion study. After the completion of dose increment, 300mg tolerated doses were selected for extended research on advanced non-small cell lung cancer, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer (80-130 cases), so as to provide recommended doses for subsequent clinical trials.</description>

    <description>A 21 day treatment cycle was administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) on day 1 of each cycle. Six consecutive dosing cycles are recommended for the dose escalation phase. In the extended study phase, after the end of the 6th treatment cycle, after the risk and benefit are evaluated by the investigator in combination with the clinical practice, if the subjects are still in a state of clinical benefit (including CR, PR and SD), the investigator can decide to appropriately extend the treatment of BAT1308. Until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, acceptance of new antitumor therapy, termination of treatment by investigator evaluation, or 12 months after initial administration, whichever is the earliest.</description>
