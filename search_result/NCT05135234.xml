  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When muscles are not contracting, the local energy demand by muscle and use of specific fuels&#xD;
      used to produce energy by oxidative metabolism are minimal. The time people spend sitting&#xD;
      inactive (sedentary time) typically comprises more than half of the day. This sedentary&#xD;
      behavior is associated with elevated risk of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, some cancers,&#xD;
      and multiple conditions leading to poor aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a progressive series of experiments, the driving goal is to develop a physiological&#xD;
      method for sustaining contractile activity via oxidative metabolism over more time than is&#xD;
      possible by traditional exercise (hours, not minutes per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing a physiological method suitable of prolonged muscular activity for ordinary people&#xD;
      (who are often unfit) requires gaining fundamental insights about muscle biology and&#xD;
      biomechanics. This also entails a careful appreciation of the ability to isolate specific&#xD;
      muscles in the leg during controlled movements, such as the soleus muscle during isolated&#xD;
      plantarflexion. This includes quantifying specific biological processes that are directly&#xD;
      responsive to elevated skeletal muscle recruitment. The investigators will focus on movement&#xD;
      that is safe and practical for ordinary people to do given their high amount of daily sitting&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This includes developing methods to optimally raise muscle contractile activity, in a way&#xD;
      that is not limited by fatigue, and is feasible throughout as many minutes of the day as&#xD;
      possible safely. This also requires development of methodologies to quantify specific&#xD;
      muscular activity, rather than generalized body movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to learn how much people can increase muscle metabolism by physical activity&#xD;
      that is perceived to them as being light effort. It is important to learn if this impacts&#xD;
      systemic metabolic processes under experimental conditions over a short term time span in&#xD;
      order to avoid confounding influences of changes in body weight or other factors.&#xD;

      Physical activity/inactivity will be carefully measured with objective devices. Wearable&#xD;
      devices most commonly include accelerometers capable of capturing various types of movement&#xD;
      and body posture. The intensity of muscle activation (the soleus and other leg muscles) will&#xD;
      be measured in some participants in the developmental studies with EMG, with the limb motion&#xD;
      quantified with goniometry. Skeletal muscle and whole body metabolism will be evaluated,&#xD;
      especially after isolated local contractile activity focusing on the slow oxidative soleus&#xD;
      muscle. Blood chemistry will also be investigated in this comprehensive series of studies to&#xD;
      understand how replacing sedentary time with low effort muscular activity can be enhanced.&#xD;
      Glycemia will be evaluated in the postprandial period in the morning after an overnight fast&#xD;
      when there can be standardized control of carbohydrate ingestion. This includes a&#xD;
      standardized oral glucose tolerance test with careful experimental assessment of posture and&#xD;
      muscular recruitment during the testing periods. One phase of this study is particularly&#xD;
      interested in assessing the acute responses that occur immediately as a result of contractile&#xD;
      activity, while also evaluating in another phase how this may be impacted by a change in the&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle. This includes assessing new approaches for improving metabolism&#xD;
      throughout the day by reducing the amount of time sitting inactive (i.e. sedentary time).&#xD;
      Importantly, because the potential immediate benefits of muscle contractile activity are&#xD;
      directly dependent on the duration of activity, the investigators aim to develop in a series&#xD;
      of experiments how much muscular activity time can be performed comfortably and safely by&#xD;
      anybody instead of sitting inactive with low muscle metabolism regardless of age, fitness,&#xD;
      body type, and other conditions commonly limiting effectiveness of traditional exercise&#xD;
      prescriptions.&#xD;
