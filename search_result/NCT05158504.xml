      notifications applied to emergency nurses on job satisfaction, compassion fatigue and&#xD;
      communication skills during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Emergency room nurses working on the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic;&#xD;
      many factors such as excessive workload, prolonged working hours, threat of infection, death&#xD;
      of the patients they care for have caused them to experience physical, social and&#xD;

      with a total of 60 nurses working in the emergency units of two training and research&#xD;
      hospitals in Istanbul. Participants were divided into motivational group and control group.&#xD;
      Motivational notifications were sent via Short Message Service (SMS) to the mobile phones of&#xD;
      the participants in the motivational group (n=30) for 21 days. No motivational notification&#xD;
      was sent to the control group (n=30) during this process. Data were obtained with the&#xD;
      Individual Introduction Form, Job Satisfaction, Compassion Fatigue and Communication Skills&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;

    <measure>Job Satisfaction-Short Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Job satisfaction scale is in a 5-point Likert type and is graded as (1- Absolutely disagree and 5-Absolutely agree). Scoring of the scale is calculated as a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5 points, and the average of 5 related items is taken. Accordingly, the decrease in the average score of the participants indicates that job satisfaction decreases; an increase in the average score indicates an increase in job satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compassion Fatigue-Short Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rarely/never (1) and often (10) is a 10-point Likert type, with the smallest 13 and the highest 130 points. As the scores obtained from the scale increase, the level of compassion fatigue experienced by individuals increases.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Communication Skills Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is a 5-point Likert-type scale, graded from &quot;always&quot; to &quot;never&quot;. The scale consists of a total of 25 expressions and the highest score that can be obtained is 125 and the lowest score is 25. High scores reflect that individuals evaluate their communication skills positively.</description>

    <description>Motivational notifications were sent to the nurses in the motivational group (n=30) via SMS messages to their mobile phones at 07.00, 12.00 and 16.00 for 21 days. Like a good morning message that allows you to start the day with a beautiful energy (Example: Thank you for the hard and selfless work you do every day. We love and appreciate angels like you and you. Good morning). Motivational notifications sent to the participants were prepared each day to be different from the previous day. Data were obtained with the Individual Introduction Form, Job Satisfaction, Compassion Fatigue and Communication Skills Scale.</description>
