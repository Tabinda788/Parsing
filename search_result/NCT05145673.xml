  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease and it is a highly prevalent globally.&#xD;
      Cinnamon is a spicy used on the traditional cuisine, which have as been associated with&#xD;
      beneficial effects on postprandial blood glucose levels (BGL). The aim of the present study&#xD;
      was to investigate the effect of cinnamon tea (6g C. burmannii/100mL) on postprandial&#xD;
      glycaemia in type 2 diabetic adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ethical committee approval, thirty-six subjects were selected and randomly&#xD;
      allocated in 2 groups (n=18): cinnamon group, which was administrated OGTT (oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test) followed by cinnamon tea; control group, which was administrated only OGTT.&#xD;
      At baseline, anthropometric data, medical condition and pharmacological therapy were&#xD;
      collected. A 24-hour dietary recall was taken preceding each intervention. Food Processor SQL&#xD;
      (version 10.5.9) program was used to analyze the food nutritional composition. Chemical&#xD;
      analysis was performed for total phenols determinations (adapted from Prabha et al) and&#xD;
      antioxidant activity for FRAP and for DPPH tests (adapted from K. Thaipong et al.)&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics program. Data are mean±SEM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) subjects aged between 35-77 years were recruited into this&#xD;
      study through nutrition appointment, Holon Pharmacy from Lisbon and Portalegre, Portugal.&#xD;
      After the approval of the Ethics Committee, 36 individuals, were selected and invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. After eligibility criteria applied, a randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial, blind to participants, was conducted to 36 DM2 subjects. Participants were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to intervention (n=18) or control group (n=18). The first participant of&#xD;
      the study was randomly allocated to intervention or control group and the following&#xD;
      participants were systematically allocated in each group. The anonymity and the&#xD;
      confidentiality of the participants data collected were guaranteed through a code attributed&#xD;
      to each participant. The control group was given a glucose solution to oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test (OGTT) and the intervention group was given a glucose solution to OGTT followed by a&#xD;
      cinnamon aqueous extract. The glucose solution consist in a glucose drink with 75g of&#xD;
      anhydrous D-Glucose dissolved in 200 mL of water at room temperature, as prescribed by ADA.&#xD;
      The blood glucose levels were measured before intervention at fasting (t0) and after 30&#xD;
      (t30), 60 (t60, 90 (t90) and 120 (t120) minutes after intervention from both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aqueous cinnamon extract was prepared by Cinnamomum burmannii bark (from Sucrame Company,&#xD;
      Portugal) with Indonesia origin. Sticks of cinnamon (60 g) were soaked into 1000 mL of water.&#xD;
      After 24 h at room temperature, cinnamon solution was heated for 30 min at 100°C and then&#xD;
      filtered at room temperature. After the cinnamon tea preparation a 100 mL individual dose was&#xD;
      distributed to each participant. For chemical analysis, a hydromethanolic extract (50 : 50)&#xD;
      was performed with aqueous cinnamon extract previously obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric paraments and pharmacological therapy data were collected at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study. At day before the intervention, a 24-hour food recall questionnaire was employed&#xD;
      to participants of the study and carefully instructed by an investigator to complete the food&#xD;
      record. The Food Processor SQL (10.14.2. version) programme was applied to analysed the&#xD;
      nutritional composition of meals, such as, total energy intake (Kcal), proteins (g), lipids&#xD;
      (g), carbohydrates (g), dietary fibre (g) and soluble fibre (g). It were also estimated the&#xD;
      glycemic index and glycemic load of food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the blood glucose values, the blood glucose incremental area under the curve (AUCi)&#xD;
      of each participant was defined using the GraphPad Prism program (version 5.0). Maximum&#xD;
      concentrations (Cmax) and variations of maximum concentrations (ΔCmax) were determined by&#xD;
      comparing with its respective baseline glycemia levels values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total phenolic concentration in the C. burmanni extract was determined according to&#xD;
      Folin-Ciocalteu method employing gallic acid as standard. For the determination of&#xD;
      antioxidant activity two methods were performed: FRAP and DPPH, adapted by Thaipong et al.&#xD;
      The FRAP method for determination of ferric reducing effect was based on the reduction, at&#xD;
      low pH, employing a colourless ferric complex (Fe3+) to a blue-coloured ferrous complex&#xD;
      (Fe2+) by electron-donating antioxidants action in 2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ)&#xD;
      presence.&#xD;
