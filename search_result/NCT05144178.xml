  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sotrovimab is a newly developed monoclonal antibody for the treatment of mild and moderate&#xD;
      COVID-19 patient, who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including&#xD;
      hospitalization or death. This includes, for example, individuals who are 65 years of age and&#xD;
      older or individuals who have certain medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and effectiveness of this investigational therapy continues to be evaluated for&#xD;
      treatment of COVID-19. Sotrovimab is not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to&#xD;
      COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the clinical trial results are too preliminary for the drug to enter routine use in UAE&#xD;
      the drug approved only for emergency use, until further evidence shows Sotrovimab is&#xD;
      effective, so we thought about this study as a tool to assess the success of Emirats Health&#xD;
      service (EHS) strategy for fighting against COVID-19 outside the hospital setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      May 26, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization&#xD;
      (EUA) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as described&#xD;
      in the Scope of Authorization (Section II) of this letter, pursuant to Section 564 of the&#xD;
      Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. §360bbb-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      May 28,2021 the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention approved the investigational drug for&#xD;
      emergency use, and Emirats health service considered strategy for fighting against COVID-19&#xD;
      outside the hospital setting, based on this strategy ,special protocol was finalized and&#xD;
      approved including initiation of infusion units for the drug in EHS hospital and primary&#xD;
      health care centers, all Infection Prevention and Control Precautions were taken&#xD;
      inconsideration .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Sotrovimab infusion in&#xD;
      cohort of ambulatory patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 at high risk for&#xD;
      hospitalization, in UAE. We expect to assess the Proportion of patients who have progression&#xD;
      of COVID-19 through 28 days as defined by visit to a hospital emergency room for management&#xD;
      or illness, or hospitalization more than 24 h for acute management of illness or death. files&#xD;
      of patients treated from June 2021 till October 2021 will be reviewed and data will be&#xD;
      collected based on the protocol approved from MOHAP ethical committee.&#xD;
