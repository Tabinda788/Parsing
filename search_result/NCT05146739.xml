      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of uproleselan in&#xD;
      combination with fludarabine and cytarabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia,&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome, or mixed phenotype acute leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or&#xD;
      does not respond to treatment (refractory) and the expresses E-selectin ligand on the cell&#xD;
      membrane. Uproleselan binds to E-selectin expressed on endothelial cells and prevents their&#xD;
      interaction with selectin-E ligand-expressing cancer cells. This may prevent tumor cell&#xD;
      activation, migration, and spreading to other places in the body (metastasis). Chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs, such as fludarabine and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Giving uproleselan in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine may&#xD;
      cause cancer to stop growing or to shrink for a period of time.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose of uproleselan&#xD;
      (GMI-1271) administered in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine to patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or mixed phenotype acute leukemia&#xD;
      (MPAL) whose blasts express the E-selectin ligand and that are in second or greater relapse&#xD;
      or refractory to relapse therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of uproleselan (GMI-1271) in&#xD;
      combination with fludarabine and cytarabine in patients with refractory and/or relapsed AML,&#xD;
      MDS or MPAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To define and describe the toxicities of uproleselan (GMI-1271) in combination with&#xD;
      fludarabine and cytarabine among patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML, MDS or MPAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the expression of E-selectin ligand on the surface of myeloid leukemic blasts&#xD;
      at relapse prior to initiation of uproleselan (GMI-1271) in combination with fludarabine and&#xD;
      cytarabine and at completion of the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the antileukemic activity of uproleselan (GMI-1271) (complete remission&#xD;
      [CR]/CR with partial recover of platelet count [CRp]/CR with incomplete blood count recovery&#xD;
      [CRi] and rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative response after up to two cycles of&#xD;
      therapy) in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine within the limits of a Phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the largest relative reduction in myeloid leukemic blast percentage in the&#xD;
      bone marrow, calculated from baseline at time of enrollment to up to two cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
