  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) affects 257million individuals worldwide. In 2017, it caused around&#xD;
      39.7 million cases of cirrhosis and 0.4 million cirrhosis-related deaths in 2017. However,&#xD;
      there is no specific treatment for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. Although nucleos(t)ide analogues&#xD;
      (NAs) profoundly suppress viral replication, fibrosis/cirrhosis progression can still occur&#xD;
      in NA-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are antidiabetic drugs that may&#xD;
      prevent fibrosis/cirrhosis progression by reducing hepatic steatosis/inflammation, dampening&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, and reducing fluid retention, effects&#xD;
      of which are independent of glycemic control. Clinical studies in diabetic patients show&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors reduce hepatis steatosis/inflammation, regress ascites (a cirrhotic&#xD;
      complication), and improve liver function parameters and survival prognosis in terms of model&#xD;
      for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. There are currently no randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs) on role of SGLT2 inhibitors in preventing fibrosis/cirrhosis progression in CHB&#xD;
      patients. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and transient elastography (TE) are&#xD;
      non-invasive techniques for liver stiffness measurement (LSM), although MRE is more accurate&#xD;
      than TE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare&#xD;
      effect of empagliflozin (an SLGT2 inhibitor) with placebo (1:1 ratio) in preventing fibrosis&#xD;
      progression in both diabetic and non-diabetic NA-treated CHB patients with advanced&#xD;
      fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis. 228 patients will be randomly sampled from our pre-existing&#xD;
      TE database. Empagliflozin 10mg daily will be given to treatment arm. Placebo pills will be&#xD;
      manufactured identical in appearance to empagliflozin. Subjects will receive active or&#xD;
      placebo pills for three years, and undergo clinical, anthropometric and laboratory&#xD;
      assessments (at baseline, weeks 8, 16, and every 4 months thereafter). They will undergo LSM&#xD;
      by TE at baseline, end of first, second and third year, and by MRE at baseline and end of&#xD;
      third year. Primary outcome is difference in change to liver stiffness (measured by MRE) from&#xD;
      baseline between the two groups at the end of third year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors can prevent hepatic&#xD;
      fibrosis/cirrhosis progression in NA-treated CHB patients.&#xD;

      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) affects 257million individuals worldwide. In 2017, it caused around&#xD;

      complication), and improve liver function parameters and survival prognosis in terms of model&#xD;
      for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Our preliminary data from a territory-wide&#xD;
      electronic healthcare database shows SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with 58% reduction in&#xD;
      risk of cirrhosis development over three years among CHB patients with diabetes (n=9,502).&#xD;
      There are currently no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on role of SGLT2 inhibitors in&#xD;
      preventing fibrosis/cirrhosis progression in CHB patients. Magnetic resonance elastography&#xD;
      (MRE) and transient elastography (TE) are non-invasive techniques for liver stiffness&#xD;
      measurement (LSM), although MRE is more accurate than TE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novelty of utilizing &quot;drug repositioning&quot; by changing role of SGLT2 inhibitors in&#xD;
      treating diabetes mellitus (DM) to preventing fibrosis/cirrhosis progression in CHB deserves&#xD;
      exploration. We propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare&#xD;
      effect of empagliflozin (an SLGT2 inhibitor) with placebo (1:1 ratio) in reducing liver&#xD;
      stiffness in both diabetic and non-diabetic NA-treated CHB patients with advanced&#xD;
      fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis. 228 patients will be randomly sampled from our pre-existing&#xD;
      TE database. Empagliflozin 10mg daily will be given to treatment arm. Placebo pills will be&#xD;
      manufactured identical in appearance to empagliflozin. Subjects will receive active or&#xD;
      placebo pills for three years, and undergo clinical, anthropometric and laboratory&#xD;
      assessments (at baseline, weeks 8, 16, and every 4 months thereafter). They will undergo LSM&#xD;
      by TE at baseline, end of first, second and third year, and by MRE at baseline and end of&#xD;
      third year. Primary outcome is difference in change to liver stiffness (measured by MRE) from&#xD;
      baseline between the two groups at the end of third year. Secondary outcomes are remission of&#xD;
      advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, progression of advanced fibrosis to cirrhosis, improvement of&#xD;
      laboratory results (liver transaminases, ferritin, glucose, lipid profiles) and&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors can prevent hepatic&#xD;
      fibrosis/cirrhosis progression in NA-treated CHB patients.&#xD;
