  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions originate from agriculture. Consumer&#xD;
      demand for food, especially carbon-intensive red meats, largely underlies these emissions.&#xD;
      Therefore, reducing consumption of red meat has the potential for transformative impacts on&#xD;
      climate change. Our interdisciplinary team of researchers and dining staff aims to determine&#xD;
      the carbon impact of evidence-based behavior change interventions to reduce red meat&#xD;
      consumption at University of Michigan dining halls. Using an experimental design, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the impacts of three &quot;nudge&quot; interventions (i.e., modifying environmental cues and&#xD;
      incentives) to reduce red meat consumption in three randomly assigned treatment dining halls&#xD;
      vis-Ã -vis three paired control dining halls. Nudges will include changing default food items&#xD;
      and altering food labels. We will: 1) collect data on meals served during each intervention&#xD;
      periods to assess the separate and combined effects of the interventions on red meat&#xD;
      consumption; 2) conduct e-mail interviews with students to understand treatment effect&#xD;
      heterogeneity and sociodemographic determinants of food choice; and, 3) conduct focus group&#xD;
      discussions and interviews, respectively, with students and dining staff to assess&#xD;
      implementation feasibility. We expect that this research will generate scalable, replicable&#xD;
      solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through dietary change at universities and&#xD;
      similar institutions, will significantly advance the food choice literature, and will&#xD;
      influence sustainability strategies at university dining operations nationally given the&#xD;
      proposed team's close partnership with regional and national dining programs.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We will carry out the proposed project within six of the University of Michigan's MDining's nine residential dining halls on the Ann Arbor campus. Using a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we will create three matched pairs among the six dining halls based on the size of each facility. One dining hall from each of the pairs will be randomly assigned to a treatment and control group, respectively.&#xD;
Participants will receive interventions based on which dining halls they visit regularly and most often.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants are not randomly allocated to treatment groups, but rather, dining halls are randomly allocated to treatments. This is what &quot;Randomized&quot; refers to under &quot;Allocation&quot; below.&#xD;
Under &quot;Enrollment&quot; below, the number of participants refers strictly to the number of participants in an e-mail survey that will go out to students during each of the three semesters of the project. We anticipate 1,000 respondents during each semester. These respondents do not include the entire population of dining hall patrons that will interact with the dining halls (and therefore the interventions) during the three semesters of the study.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>11 week intervention period (during each of 3 academic semesters)</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the amount of red meat served across project dining halls from the the pre-intervention to the intervention period using &quot;post-cost&quot; data collected by operations staff (i.e., the amount of each dish prepared prior to the start of a meal period as well as the amount of each dish remaining at the end of the meal period with units of measure standardized to kg. We will assess the average weight of red meat served in each dining hall during the pre-intervention baseline period compared to the average weight of red meat served in each dining hall during the intervention period. We will do a difference-in-difference analysis to identify whether the change in the amount of red meat served at treatment vs. control dining halls differed during this time period. Difference-in-difference analyses examine the difference in the change in an outcome between a treatment and control group.</description>

    <time_frame>11 week intervention period (during each of 3 academic semesters)</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the amount of red meat consumed by a subsample of dining hall patrons (n = 1,000) at each of the 6 project dining halls from the start to the end of each intervention period. This will be done through a self-administered food frequency questionnaire that asks respondents to report their frequency of consumption of red meat items in the previous 30 days.&#xD;
We will do a difference-in-difference analysis to identify whether the change in the amount of red meat consumed by respondents who frequently patron treatment vs. control dining halls differed during this time period.</description>

    <time_frame>15 weeks (4 week baseline period + 11 week intervention period (during each of 3 academic semesters)</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the average amount of red meat served in each of the 6 project dining halls during the pre-intervention and the intervention periods. We will assess the difference in this amount of red meat served within a single dining hall to assess if and how this amount changed. Data on red meat served in each dining hall will begin 4 weeks before the start of each intervention period, thereby allowing us to compare the amount of red meat served before interventions begin to red meat served thereafter.&#xD;
We will assess the average weight of red meat served in each dining hall during the pre-intervention baseline period compared to the average weight of red meat served in each dining hall during the intervention period.</description>

    <description>We will implement taste-focused labels on plant-based dishes in each of the 3 treatment dining halls to re-brand dishes with attributes focused on the taste of the dish (e.g., renaming a &quot;Squash with Ginger&quot; side to &quot;Aromatic Thai Curry Kabocha Squash With Zesty Ginger&quot;).</description>

    <description>We will add labels next to all dishes served in treatment dining halls that indicate whether production of the ingredients in the dish contribute a high, moderate or low amount of carbon emissions. These labels will be absent from the same dishes served in control dining halls. Labels will be added to point-of-service signs, digital menu boards, and menu information on a mobile app.</description>

    <description>We will make red meat items an opt-in (as opposed to opt-out) item across all meal stations in treatment dining halls. All menu stations will exclude red meat by default, and dining hall patrons will have to request the addition of red meat to meals. At control dining halls, red meat items will be provided by default at meal stations as normal.</description>
