  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-FDG PET imaging is now considered the most effective method used in the clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of viable myocardium. However, the need for fasting or glucose and insulin loading&#xD;
      in the 18F-FDG PET protocol makes it unfavorable for a certain group of patients (i.e.,&#xD;
      insulin-resistance and diabetic patients). XTR003 is a fatty acid analog used for PET&#xD;
      imaging, developed at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital affiliated to Sinotau Pharmaceutical Group.&#xD;
      XTR003 is a promising fatty acid analog and perhaps have a potential clinical utility in the&#xD;
      evaluation of viable myocardium. This phase I study investigated the safety, biodistribution,&#xD;
      radiation dosimetry and Pharmacokinetics of XTR003 in 10 Chinese normal healthy volunteers&#xD;
      both male and female between the ages of 18-40.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      XTR003 is a PET imaging radiopharmaceutical agent used to trace myocardial fatty acid&#xD;
      metabolism. XTR003 is a modified fatty acid that enters the myocytes and passes through&#xD;
      mitochondrial membrane by the same process as the natural existing fatty acids and then&#xD;
      undergoes partial Î²-oxidation before being trapped in the mitochondria. In preclinical study&#xD;
      XTR003 showed high myocardial uptake and retention [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I study, the study will be open-label, nonrandomised, single-arm,&#xD;
      single-center clinical study. Subjects will receive single dose of XTR003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry and Pharmacokinetics was investigated.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety of healthy Chinese adults after a single dose of XTR003 intravenous injection. On Day1 of the study all subjects received a single dose 8.0-10 mCi of XTR003 intravenously.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 14 days post injection</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects returned to the hospital on Day 2 and Day 7 after XTR003 injection for safety observation that included: Physical examination, vital signs monitoring, blood troponin-I levels, routine blood test, blood biochemistry test, routine urine test, and 12-lead electrocardiogram. On Day 14 all subjects were telephoned for the final follow-up. All adverse events after enrolment in the study will be documented.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the biodistribution of XTR003</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>XTR003 biodistribution will be determined by whole body PET imaging acquisition at point time intervals at 0-60, 120, 150, 240, and 270 minutes. Venous blood collection of 10 ml from each subject at set time points at 1.5, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after administration and at 4 and 7 hours for radioactivity measurement. Urine collection will begin immediately after injection up to ~ 7.25 hours for radioactivity measurement.</description>
