  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the gastrointestinal tolerance of chronic consumption (7 days) of&#xD;
      a novel alpha glucan compared to a rapidly available carbohydrate (glucose syrup).&#xD;

      This study will be randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, and 3x3&#xD;
      crossover in design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive the below products in single dose and in&#xD;
      different random sequence, as determined by the randomization system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. novel alpha glucan (80 g/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. novel alpha glucan (180 g/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. glucose syrup (180 g/day)&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout 7 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Validated questionnaire exploring the presence and severity of GI symptoms over the previous 7 days. The GSRS is a disease-specific instrument of 15 items combined into five symptom clusters depicting reflux, abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhea and constipation. The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-type scale where 1 represents absence of troublesome symptoms and 7 represents very troublesome symptoms. The effect of the interventions on the GSRS will be assessed by a linear mixed model and will take into account information on this from all 7 days of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout 7 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Bristol stool scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human faeces into seven categories. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation, with 3 and 4 being the ideal stools, whereas 5 indicate lack of dietary fiber, and 6 and 7 indicate diarrhoea. The effect of the interventions on stool consistency will be assessed by a linear mixed model and will take into account information on this from all 7 days of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout 7 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The participants report the number of defecations they have per day, throughout the 7 days study period. There is a large variability in this, but typically 1-3 defecations per day is considered normal, whereas more indicate a runny stool, and fewer a tendency for constipation. The effect of the interventions on stool frequency will be assessed by changes in stool frequency over time, taking all information on this from all 7 days of treatment into account.</description>
