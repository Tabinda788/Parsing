  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research was to compare the responsiveness of Barthel Index (BI) and Longshi&#xD;
      Scale (LS) for assessing activities of daily living (ADL) in stroke survivors at different&#xD;
      stage and we also aimed to observe changes of ADL score in stroke survivors over time.&#xD;

      The whole experiment process has been supervised by a research assistant, and all the data&#xD;
      collected are recorded on paper case report forms. The research assistant also takes charge&#xD;
      of checking the consistency of data enter into the registry against predefined rules. Stroke&#xD;
      survivors in Shenzhen Second People's Hospital have been invited to participate in this study&#xD;
      and divide into three groups according to their duration of stroke (acute stroke, subacute&#xD;
      stroke and chronic strike).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information was collected within 24 hours of admission. ADL of stroke survivors was&#xD;
      assessed on admission, at discharge and 3 months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size in this study was calculated according to the sample size calculation&#xD;
      formula: n=[(µα+µβ)(µα+µβ)(1+1/k)p(1-p)]/(pe-pc)(pe-pc). Investigations in many places in&#xD;
      China showed that varying degrees of dysfunction remain in 70%-80% of stroke survivors, and&#xD;
      the disability rate is 30.2%-62.8%. In this reserach，p=(pe+kpc)/(1+k)，pe=0.3，pc =0.6,&#xD;
      α=0.05，β=0.1, so µ0.05=1.6449，µ0.10=1.2816，thus the sample size in our study was n=47. We&#xD;
      assume that 10% of them loss to follow-up, thus the sample size in our study was 52 in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Internal responsiveness First, standardized effect size (SES) was calculated by dividing&#xD;
           the mean change in score between admission and discharge assessments by the standard&#xD;
           deviation (SD) of the admission score. second, the standardized response mean (SRM) was&#xD;
           obtained by dividing the mean change scores by the SD of the change score between&#xD;
           admission and discharge scores. A value of SES or SRM&gt;0.8 was large, 0.5 to 0.8&#xD;
           moderate, and 0.2 to 0.5 small.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. External responsiveness The pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to investigate&#xD;
           the external responsiveness. An r value &gt;0.75 represented good to excellent association;&#xD;
           values of 0.50 to 0.75, moderate to good association; values of 0.25 to 0.50, fair&#xD;
           association; and values ≤0.25, little association between the changes in scores on these&#xD;
           measures. And the significance threshold was set at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve For this study, the area under ROC curve&#xD;
           (AUC) obtained by comparing subjects who improved by one or more levels on the modified&#xD;
           Rankin scale vs. those who exhibit no change on the modified Rankin scale. Larger AUC&#xD;
           means higher screening accuracy. In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination,&#xD;
           0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than&#xD;
           0.9 is considered outstanding.&#xD;
