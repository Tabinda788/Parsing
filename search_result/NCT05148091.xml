      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ clinical&#xD;
      trial in adults aged ≥ 18 years previously unvaccinated. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety , tolerability and immunogenicity of the experimental SARS-CoV-2 protein&#xD;
      vaccine (SCTV01C). The experimental vaccine and adjuvant (one placebo) were both manufactured&#xD;
      by Sinocelltech, Ltd., while the saline (the other placebo) was commercially purchased. A&#xD;
      total of 752 participants will be enrolled, with 112 at phase Ⅰ, and 640 at phase Ⅱ. There&#xD;
      will be two dosage levels (20μg and 40μg), and two age gruops (18~59 years old and ≥ 60 years&#xD;
      old ) at both Phase Ⅰ and Phase Ⅱ. All of participants will be assigned to receive two doses&#xD;
      of experimental vaccine(20μg or 40μg) or placebo (Adjuvant or Saline) on the schedule of Day&#xD;
      0 and Day 28.&#xD;
