    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, multi-center, two-arms,parallel, randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      with a superiority design,conducted in China. The investigators conduct this multi-centre,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial to test the hypothesis that NHFOV is more effective than nCPAP&#xD;
      in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in infants with a gestational age of&#xD;
      less than 30 weeks or a birth weight of less than 1500g when used as a primary noninvasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV) mode.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are eligible to the study if they they match the following inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: (1) Gestational age (GA) less than 30 weeks or Birth weight less than 1500g; (2)&#xD;
      They have a diagnose of RDS, and Oxygenation index(OI)(OI=(FiO2×Paw)×100/PaO2)≧2; (3) Age&#xD;
      less than 2 hours; (4)Informed parental consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonates will be randomized and assigned either to nCPAP or NHFOV arms with a 1:1ratio, when&#xD;
      patients fulfill all inclusion criteria. Randomization cannot be done earlier. Simple&#xD;
      randomization will be done according to a computer-generated random number table and will be&#xD;
      posted in a specific secured website 24/7 available. Twins will be allocated in the same&#xD;
      treatment group. Infants randomized to one arm cannot crossover to the other or vice- versa&#xD;
      during the study. For all the groups, if the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) requirement&#xD;
      is persistently higher than 0.30 per target SpO2 89-94% after starting the respiratory&#xD;
      support, newborns receive Surfactant by &quot;LISA&quot; technique, administration of surfactant&#xD;
      (Curosurf,Chiesi Pharmaceutics, Parma, Italy) 200 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the administration of surfactant, if FiO2 requirement is persistently &gt;0.4 to keep SpO2&#xD;
      89-94% or severe apnea episodes are present (defined as recurrent apnea with &gt;3 episodes/h&#xD;
      associated with heart rate &lt;100/min or a single episode of apnea requiring bag and mask&#xD;
      ventilation within a 24-hour period ) or at the blood gas (arterial or free-flowing capillary&#xD;
      blood) PaCO2&gt;60 mmHg and potential of hydrogen (pH)&lt;7.20 obtained at least 1 hour after&#xD;
      commencement of the assigned treatment, newborns are intubated and mechanically ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the newborns enrolled in the study, arterial or free-flowing capillary blood gas is&#xD;
      checked every 6-12 hours, a cerebral and cardiac ultrasound screening is performed within 24&#xD;
      hrs. Further controls follow the routine of the ward.&#xD;

    <description>neonates assigned to the nCPAP group will be started on a pressure of 6 cmH2O( adjust range:6-10 cmH2O) , with FiO2 (0.21-0.40)adjusted to target SpO2 from 89% to 94%. CPAP will be provided by either variable flow or continuous flow devices, as there is no clear evidence that one type of CPAP generator would be better than any other by pure CPAP system.</description>
