    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect on hemolysis and red blood cells (RBC) transfusions over a 24-week&#xD;
      treatment period of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination treatment versus ravulizumab&#xD;
      treatment in patients with active Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) who are&#xD;
      complement inhibitor treatment-naive or have not recently received complement inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination treatment versus ravulizumab&#xD;
           treatment on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measures of hemolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transfusion parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fatigue as assessed by Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by COAs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety and tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complement activation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the concentrations of total pozelimab and total ravulizumab in serum and total&#xD;
           cemdisiran and total complement factor 5 (C5) protein in plasma&#xD;

    <description>FACIT-Fatigue Scale is a 13-item, self-reported PRO measure assessing an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. This questionnaire is part of the FACIT measurement system, a compilation of questions measuring health-related QoL in patients with cancer and other chronic illnesses. The FACIT-fatigue assesses the level of fatigue using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>
