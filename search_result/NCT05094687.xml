      INTRODUCTION: An outbreak of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-coV-2) occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China&#xD;
      in December 2019. Although pulmonary health has been the main focus of studies, recent&#xD;
      studies show that cutaneous symptoms appear in COVID-19 patients, with differing levels of&#xD;
      severity even in those patients who were once thought to be asymptomatic to the infection.&#xD;
      Recent studies show association of skin manifestations of COVID-19 with severity of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection, which These days, ongoing interest of clinical trials. Although not much is known&#xD;
      concerning the pathophysiologic mechanisms of these cutaneous manifestations, their&#xD;
      identification may be vital to early diagnosis and lead to possible better prognosis in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To examine cutaneous manifestations of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLACE OF STUDY: Department of Dermatology Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) Karachi,&#xD;
      Sindh, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: The longitudinal study will be conducted on patients with COVID-19 at&#xD;
      JPMC Karachi. Permission from the ethical review committee will be taken prior to conduction&#xD;
      of study and demographic data and informed consent will be taken from every patient or their&#xD;
      guardians. forr data collection non-probability convenience sampling method will be used.&#xD;
      Sample size of study would be 1206 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA&#xD;
      positive patients. Detailed history and examination of patients including cutaneous&#xD;
      examination be conducted in COVID-19 patients by dermatologists. The data would include&#xD;
      gender, age at the time of onset of COVID-19, presence/ absence of comorbidities, the&#xD;
      presence/absence of cutaneous manifestation, cutaneous patterns, the duration of skin&#xD;
      manifestations, presence or absence of systemic symptoms, skin-related symptoms, type of&#xD;
      systemic symptoms, the duration of systemic symptoms, the time of onset of skin&#xD;
      manifestation, the latency between the systemic symptoms and cutaneous manifestations, and&#xD;
      the COVID-19 severity ( mild/asymptomatic (gastrointestinal symptoms, cough or fever)&#xD;
      moderate (dyspnea or pneumonia on x-ray) or severe (death, thromboembolic event or&#xD;
      ventilator). The lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients 20 years of age or older irrespect of&#xD;
      symptoms were included. Patients with pre-existing dermatological disease, autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, malignancy or chemotherapy, pregnant or lactating women, blood transfusion, on&#xD;
      immunosuppressant, malabsorption syndrome or taking any drug/vaccine within 14 days before&#xD;
      onset of skin lesions will be excluded. Photographs of skin lesions will be taken by consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS: SPSS version 23 registered for Microsoft windows will be used for analysis.&#xD;
      Mean and standard deviation will be calculated for expression of quantitative variables like&#xD;
      age and disease duration of skin. Systemic symptoms duration, the latency between the&#xD;
      systemic and cutaneous manifestations, and age for disease outcome will be calculated by&#xD;
      median and interquartile range. Gender, co-morbidities, presence or absence of cutaneous/&#xD;
      systemic manifestations, cutaneous symptoms, skin patterns, time of onset of rash, and&#xD;
      disease outcome covid-19 will be calculated by frequencies and percentages. Effect modifiers&#xD;
      like age, gender, weight, co-morbidities, duration of symptoms will be controlled through&#xD;
      stratification. Poststratification will be recalculated and chi-square test will be applied.&#xD;
      P-value of &lt;0.05% will be considered as significant.&#xD;
