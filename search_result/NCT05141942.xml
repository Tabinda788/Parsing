  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-surgical biliary leaks are relatively common after surgeries associated with&#xD;
      hepatobiliary health. Left untreated, biliary leaks can lead to significant morbidity.&#xD;
      Biliary leaks are most often successfully managed endoscopically, by way of performing an&#xD;
      ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography) procedure. These procedures help&#xD;
      manage the bile leak by decreasing pressure at the opening of the common bile duct and&#xD;
      promoting bile flow into the small bowel (rather than out the leak) via stent insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines published by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) report&#xD;
      that stents are generally placed for 4 to 6 weeks and recommend longer intervals for more&#xD;
      complex leaks. However, formal recommendations concerning the modality of biliary stent&#xD;
      removal do not exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One option is performing a repeat ERCP when removing the stent. While comprehensive, this&#xD;
      exposes the patient to additional radiation, and requires additional fluoroscopy resources&#xD;
      and/or technicians. Furthermore, ERCPs are less available, especially in smaller centers, and&#xD;
      are costly. A second option is a gastroscopy with simple stent removal has, given the low&#xD;
      probability of requiring repeat intervention, the relatively low procedural cost, and the&#xD;
      relatively favorable adverse event profile, and easier accessibility compared to ERCP&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple, safe and reliable prediction rule was developed retrospectively to identify&#xD;
      patients in whom biliary stent removal via gastroscopy could be safely performed, as opposed&#xD;
      to repeat ERCP. A positive result using the rule requires satisfaction of four non-invasive&#xD;
      clinical markers: (1) a normal post-surgical serum alkaline phosphatase value, (2) bile leak&#xD;
      'type C' at initial ERCP (a small or absent leak with no other biliary pathology), (3) a bile&#xD;
      leak caused by laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and (4) a time between initial and follow-up&#xD;
      endoscopy of 4 to 8 weeks. Validating this prediction rule prospectively could have&#xD;
      implications on patient safety by decreasing ERCP-related adverse events, and could also have&#xD;
      important implications with regard to health resource utilization.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The previously developed prediction rule will be applied in a prospective fashion to&#xD;
      consecutive patients undergoing ERCP for suspected post-surgical biliary leak. The same&#xD;
      variables will be measured as in the initial study, but in this study, a research assistant&#xD;
      (RA) will prospectively enter data and follow up with patients. For the purposes of this&#xD;
      study, a second ERCP will be planned for stent removal and repeat cholangiogram (as per&#xD;
      current practice). The sequence of procedures will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial ERCP Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient is referred to PLC Endoscopy Unit for consideration of ERCP procedure for&#xD;
           indication of post-surgical biliary leak and is booked by the attending&#xD;
           advanced/therapeutic endoscopist on call as appropriate, as per the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Once verbal and written consent to approach has been given to their admitting nurse,&#xD;
           patients will be approached by the RA prior to their procedure to discuss the actively&#xD;
           enrolling study, and to answer any potential questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the patient agrees to participate, the informed consent form(s) is/are signed and&#xD;
           witnessed. If the patient decides not to participate, the ERCP proceeds as per the usual&#xD;
           standard of care (and the sequence that follows does not apply).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The RA collects relevant patient-related and pre-procedural data through combination of&#xD;
           direct patient interview and subsequent review of the medical records. Variables to be&#xD;
           collected include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. gender&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. presence of imaging evidence showing bile leak&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. type of surgery performed&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. time from surgery to ERCP&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Given that the patient will have already had an intravenous (IV) catheter placed on&#xD;
           admission to the Endoscopy Unit (for purposes of receiving sedation or anesthesia during&#xD;
           the procedure), a laboratory technician arrives to draw bloodwork from the patient to&#xD;
           collect the following variables. If all following bloodwork has already been drawn for&#xD;
           the patient within the preceding 24 hours prior to the procedure, no additional&#xD;
           bloodwork will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell count (WBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. aspartate aminotransferase (AST)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. total and direct bilirubin&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. international normalized ratio (INR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The patient is then met by the endoscopist performing the procedure to discuss the risks&#xD;
           and benefits of the procedure and to have the patient sign informed consent for the&#xD;
           procedure. The patient enters the endoscopy/fluoroscopy room and the procedure&#xD;
           commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. During the procedure, peri-procedural data are recorded by the RA by direct observation,&#xD;
           and/or, if necessary, in consultation with the procedural physician(s) and/or nurse(s).&#xD;
           Variables to be collected include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. stent length placed&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. stent caliber placed&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. presence or absence of other pathology (stones, strictures, other)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. extent of leak&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. large (defined by the presence of early extravasation of contrast from the leak&#xD;
           source prior to opacification of the intrahepatic bile ducts) ii. small (all others) e.&#xD;
           location of biliary leak on cholangiography: i. cystic duct remnant ii. accessory bile&#xD;
           duct iii. intrahepatic, left or right ducts iv. common hepatic or bile ducts v. no leak&#xD;
           found vi. uncertain/ not described f. type of leak i. Type A (large or common bile duct&#xD;
           leaks) ii. Type B (no leak observed or small leak, but other pathology observed) iii.&#xD;
           Type C (no leak observed or small leak with no other biliary pathology observed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. After the procedure is complete, the patient is moved to the recovery room for&#xD;
           observation. Depending on their disposition and the course of the procedure, observation&#xD;
           times and protocols differ. During this stage, the RA collects any relevant&#xD;
           post-procedural data, and any missing pre- or peri-procedural data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Any peri- or immediate post-procedural adverse event is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The patient is examined by the endoscopist prior to discharge and provided with written&#xD;
           post-procedure information, including a phone number to call in the event of any issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The RA meets with the patient prior to their discharge from the unit to answer any final&#xD;
           potential questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The patient is booked for repeat ERCP procedure as per standard current practices,&#xD;
           usually between 6-8 weeks, for stent removal and repeat cholangiogram to rule out&#xD;
           residual leak.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. At 30 days post-procedure, the RA reviews the medical record for occurrence of any&#xD;
           adverse event(s), in addition to calling the patient to inquire about any unplanned&#xD;
           visits to healthcare facilities. Adverse events of interest include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. perforation&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. cholangitis and/or sepsis (not present prior to the procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. pain not meeting the definition of any of the above that requires repeat unplanned&#xD;
                presentation to a healthcare facility&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. At 6 months post index procedure, any repeat or recurrent leaks and/or repeat ERCP&#xD;
           procedures are captured.&#xD;
