      This study collects information regarding your procedure. No changes will be done to your&#xD;
      procedure and you are asked to consent for the use of your data in our database. You are&#xD;
      being asked to be in this research study because you have a gastrointestinal lesion that&#xD;
      needs to be removed. We remove these lesions endoscopically as part of the standard of care&#xD;
      at Baylor St. Luke Medical Center, and we will be using a FDA approved device known as the&#xD;
      Pathfinder Rigidization Overtube to assist with the removal of the polyp. This study is&#xD;
      important because this is a relatively new procedure; although it is a part of your standard&#xD;
      of care it is not done in many hospitals. We would like to document the outcomes and results&#xD;
      of such procedures to continuously improve our standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive standard medical care and no experimental interventions will be&#xD;
      performed. The Pathfinder Overtube is already being used to assist in polyp removal at our&#xD;
      center and many other centers, thus the device itself is not experimental. All patients&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo ESD or EMR for colonic lesions at the Baylor St Luke's Medical Center as&#xD;
      medically indicated and standard of care will be considered for the study. Patients for whom&#xD;
      ESD or EMR is considered as part of their standard medical care will be offered to&#xD;
      participate in this study. The patients involvement in the study does not preclude the use of&#xD;
      the Pathfinder Overtube. If the patient does not agree to participate, outcomes related to&#xD;
      the use of the Pathfinder Overtube or personal information will not be recorded. The&#xD;
      Pathfinder Overtube will still be used to assist in the removal of polyps as deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the endoscopist. The physician performing the procedure will also discuss the&#xD;
      study with the subjects and ask them to sign a consent. If the patient agrees to participate,&#xD;
      he or she will be given the informed consent form and allowed enough time to read it.&#xD;
      Opportunity to ask questions will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: After obtaining the informed consent, the following information will be&#xD;
      collected from the subject's chart regarding the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- Demographic information related to the study participants (age, sex, race, MRN etc.) 2-&#xD;
      Comorbid conditions of the study participant (prior history of hysterectomy, or other&#xD;
      abdominal surgeries) 3- Total en bloc resection rate. 4- Total E0 resection rate. 5- Total&#xD;
      length of procedure time. 6- Total number of polyps detected, 7- Stabilization within the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal lumen 8- Complications within 1 week after the procedure (perforation,&#xD;
      bleeding) Equipment and techniques: All procedures will be performed with the Pathfinder&#xD;
      Overtube (already FDA approved for use within the gastrointestinal lumen) and 19-inch&#xD;
      high-definition monitor (OEV 191H; OlympusAmerica Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient agrees to participate, he or she will sign the consent form and a copy will be&#xD;
      provided. Data will be prospectively recorded according to the data collection form. ESD or&#xD;
      EMR with Pathfinder Overtube will be performed as medically indicated. Follow-up will be&#xD;
      carried out as medically indicated and no additional studies or clinic visits will be needed&#xD;
      specifically for the purpose of this study. Data collection will last approximately 3 years.&#xD;
