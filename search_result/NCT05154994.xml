      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of belinostat when given together&#xD;
      with tremelimumab and durvalumab in treating patients with urothelial cancer that has spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and&#xD;
      has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as tremelimumab and durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Belinostat is a&#xD;
      potential anti-cancer drug, known as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which means that&#xD;
      belinostat stops the activity of HDAC enzymes (an enzyme is a protein that in small amounts&#xD;
      can speed up a biological reaction). HDAC enzymes play an important role in cell growth and&#xD;
      cell death. Giving tremelimumab, durvalumab, and belinostat may improve the body's ability to&#xD;
      fight cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the recommended phase 2 dose of belinostat in combination with tremelimumab and&#xD;
      durvalumab in advanced solid tumors harboring ARID1A mutations with focus on urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma. (Phase 1A) II. To assess the ongoing safety of belinostat in combination with&#xD;
      tremelimumab and durvalumab in patients with advanced solid tumors with ARID1A mutation with&#xD;
      focus on urothelial cancer. (Phase 1B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of belinostat in combination with tremelimumab and durvalumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced urothelial cancer with ARID1A mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the mechanism of action of belinostat in combination with tremelimumab and&#xD;
      durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore possible mechanisms of treatment resistance. III. To explore possible&#xD;
      biomarkers predictive of treatment benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of belinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also&#xD;
      receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1. Beginning cycle 2, patients&#xD;
      receive belinostat IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 7&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive&#xD;
      durvalumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Note: Patients on effective antiretroviral therapy with an undetectable viral&#xD;
                  load at the time of screening are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;

                  hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients&#xD;
                  positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking prohibited medications. A washout period of prohibited medications for&#xD;
