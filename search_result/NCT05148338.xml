  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and has a rising prevalence&#xD;
      due to an aging population. AF increases the patient's risk of hospitalization, heart failure&#xD;
      and stroke and results into deterioration of quality of life. Treatment of symptomatic AF&#xD;
      consists of either antiarrhythmic medication or a pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) catheter&#xD;
      ablation. However, lots of patients experience recurrence of AF in the first year after PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that PVI outcomes depend on the presence of different treatable risk&#xD;
      factors that influence the substrate for AF. Those risk factors include obesity,&#xD;
      hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use, smoking and obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea syndrome. However, research into the effect of treatment of those risk factors mainly&#xD;
      consists of observational studies. Currently, it is not clear to what extent patients will&#xD;
      benefit from comprehensive risk factor treatment prior to PVI in terms of ablation success&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current randomized controlled trial is to determine the effect of a nurse-led,&#xD;
      technology-supported, personalized care pathway on hospital admissions for cardioversions and&#xD;
      re-ablation in patients with AF that are referred for ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in this study will be randomized to either the intervention group receiving&#xD;
      the comprehensive risk treatment before PVI or the control group receiving standard usual&#xD;
      care. Patients in the intervention group will visit the specialized AF nurse outpatient&#xD;
      clinic and receive a personalized treatment plan (with a maximal duration of 6 months)&#xD;
      including lifestyle interventions and medication. This includes sleep apnea screening with a&#xD;
      Home Sleep Apnea Test (WatchPAT). Patients will also use the VitalHealth Engage platform. The&#xD;
      digital platform can be used at home to report AF complaints, send home measurement and&#xD;
      complete questionnaires. Furthermore, it supports the nurse in administering effective&#xD;
      lifestyle changes by offering the patient personalized content and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both study groups will be followed up to 12 months after ablation, during which hospital&#xD;
      admissions for cardioversion and re-ablation are evaluated. At baseline, AFEQT, EQ5D and TBQ&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires will be performed. The questionnaires will be repeated prior&#xD;
      to ablation, at 3 and 12 months after ablation. At baseline, pre-ablation and after 12 months&#xD;
      laboratory tests (such as cholesterol) will be performed to evaluate adherence to lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of Life as measured by the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The questionnaire compromises 5 dimensions describing different aspects of health and an overall health perception. The 5 dimensions can each be scored from level 1 to 5. Lower levels correspond with higher quality of life and higher levels correspond with lower quality of life. Overall health perception is scored with a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100, with lower values corresponding with worse outcomes and higher values corresponding to better outcomes.</description>
