  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no effective intervention for type 1 diabetes and eating disorders. The&#xD;
      main objective of STEADY Stage 2 is to test the feasibility of the newly developed STEADY&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEADY was co-designed by using Experience Based Co-Design methodology and other qualitative&#xD;
      methods (focus groups, interviews).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings informed the development of a T1DM cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) manual.&#xD;
      The intervention will now be tested in a feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) in&#xD;
      adults with type 1 diabetes and eating disorders and compared with usual clinical care. If&#xD;
      STEADY is feasible, this may provide an effective intervention for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at King's College London. Participants will remain in the study&#xD;
      for 6 months, with a 12-month extended observation period. The study is expected to end in&#xD;
      February 2023.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Current disordered eating: defined as fear of insulin as weight gaining, avoidance/&#xD;
             restriction of insulin to control weight, food restriction, binge eating, any&#xD;
             additional disordered eating behaviour as described by the 5th revision of the&#xD;

             AND/OR a score of 20 on the DEPS-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prepared to take part in a cognitive-behavioural therapy approach behaviour change&#xD;
             strategy plus diabetes education intervention (with up to 12 sessions) with a varying&#xD;
             proportion of face-to-face and virtual delivery mode;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prepared to take part in the control group - treatment as usual (TAU)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prepared to attend physical and mental health check-up at baseline and at the end of&#xD;
             the intervention (control arm and intervention arm) face-to-face;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently under the care of a diabetes specialist team (as this study does not replace&#xD;
             usual diabetes care);&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Confirms availability to attend all sessions as part of the intervention (with the&#xD;
             option of rescheduling sessions when necessary. Therapy sessions may be in person or&#xD;
             via videoconference);&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Investigator has confidence that the participant is able to fulfill all of the trial&#xD;
             protocol requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participant has capacity to consent to the study. This is assessed by ability to&#xD;
             explain information about their involvement in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HbA1c &gt;15%/ 140.4 mmol/mol;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. More than 2 admissions for DKA in the past 12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. More than 2 SH episodes (defined as needing 3rd party assistance) in the past 12&#xD;

             treatment, substance problem use and dependence. (Potential participants with more&#xD;
             severe mental illness are unlikely to benefit from a CBT based approach, therefore&#xD;
             will be excluded to not delay their treatment. Investigators will use their clinical&#xD;
             judgement, in agreement with the trial team. Mental health assessment by a&#xD;
             psychiatrist is part of the baseline visit.);&#xD;
&#xD;
