      Myocardial strain analysis has emerged in the last decade as a reliable tool for studying&#xD;
      myocardial mechanics, adding information on cardiac performance when compared with&#xD;
      traditional parameters of left ventricle (LV) systolic function, such as ejection fraction&#xD;
      (EF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, their relative load dependency makes the myocardial deformation indices unable to&#xD;
      account for changes in pre- and afterload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial work (MW) is emerging as an alternative tool for studying LV myocardial systolic&#xD;
      function, because it incorporates both deformation and load into its analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this observational trial is to validate the use of MW in septic shock patients&#xD;
      by means of consecutive echocardiographic assessment at predefined timepoints. Secondarily,&#xD;

      Myocardial strain analysis has emerged in the last decade as a reliable tool for studying&#xD;
      myocardial mechanics, adding information on cardiac performance when compared with&#xD;
      traditional parameters of left ventricle (LV) systolic function, such as ejection fraction&#xD;
      (EF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, their relative load dependency makes the myocardial deformation indices unable to&#xD;
      account for changes in pre- and afterload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial work (MW) is emerging as an alternative tool for studying LV myocardial systolic&#xD;
      function, because it incorporates both deformation and load into its analysis. In this&#xD;
      context, MW could be considered as an advancement of myocardial strain, allowing to&#xD;
      investigate LV performance also in cases of changes in afterload that could lead to&#xD;
      misleading conclusions if relying only on strain analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions of increased afterload can in fact negatively impact on myocardial strain even if&#xD;
      MWis normal. MW assessment was initially calculated using invasive pressure measurements,&#xD;
      which limited its widespread use in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Russell et al. demonstrated that pressure-strain loops (PSLs) could estimate LV&#xD;
      performance in a non-invasive manner, deriving LV pressure (LVP) curves from non-invasively&#xD;
      acquired brachial artery cuff pressure. To date, the technique has been applied in myocardial&#xD;
      ischaemia and in identification of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)-responders with&#xD;
      good results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical approach has been never tested, insofar, septic shock patients. The heart is&#xD;
      one of the organs most frequently failing in sepsis; however, depending on the definition&#xD;
      used, the prevalence of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction may vary between 10% and 70%. The&#xD;
      sepsis-induced dysregulated inflammatory response has been directly linked to cardiomyocyte&#xD;
      dysfunction, leading to a broad spectrum of cardiomyopathies, including ventricles'&#xD;
      impairment during systole or diastole, inadequate cardiac output, oxygen delivery, or primary&#xD;
      myocardial cellular injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, in septic shocked patients, echocardiography plays a pivotal role, identifying most of&#xD;
      the clinical cardiac patterns related to acute systolic dysfunction and chambers' dilation&#xD;
      using basic level 2D and M-mode echocardiography. A more comprehensive diagnosis can be&#xD;
      achieved with advanced levels of competency. Simultaneously, hemodynamic evaluation and&#xD;
      monitoring are possible with advanced levels of competency, including the use of color&#xD;
      Doppler, spectral Doppler, tissue Doppler imaging, and, eventually, 3D or speckled tracking.&#xD;
      Specific pathways can now achieve all these steps of competence for skills certification,&#xD;
      developed by intensive care medicine societies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of cardiac changes can be associated with septic shock, although a normal study is&#xD;
      not unusual [7]. Abnormalities in LVEF (i.e., contractile impairment may be associated with&#xD;
      either a global dysfunction or exhibited as specific patterns with apical akinesis and&#xD;
      ballooning accompanied by good basal LV contraction and is almost always reversible over&#xD;
      days), LV diastolic function, and right ventricular (RV) function have all been described.&#xD;
      Since the resuscitation in septic shock is mainly focused on an aggressive and rapid fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation associated with the administration of systemic vasopressors to optimize cardiac&#xD;
      preload, output, and peripheral perfusion, the assessment of the basal cardiac function is&#xD;
      critical and should be routinely performed at the bedside for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dynamic interaction between the heart and the systemic circulation allows the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system to be efficient in providing adequate cardiac output and arterial&#xD;
      pressures necessary for sufficient organ perfusion. The cardiovascular system provides&#xD;
      adequate pressure and flow to the peripheral organs in different physiological and&#xD;
      pathological conditions because of the continuous modulation of the arterial system&#xD;
      compliance, stiffness and resistance with respect to LV systolic performance. This&#xD;
      challenging interplay may lead to a condition called &quot;ventriculo-arterial uncoupling&quot;, when&#xD;
      the ration between myocardial performance and peripheral response (Ea/Ees) is unbalanced. The&#xD;
      hemodynamic profile of septic shock is primarily characterized by generalized vasodilatation&#xD;
      resulting in severe hypotension with systemic hypoperfusion. In most of the patients with&#xD;
      septic shock, cardiovascular efficiency is impaired, and the Ea/Ees becomes uncoupled (Ea/Ees&#xD;
      &gt; 1). Th e hemodynamic profile is characterized by both the significant increase in Ea and&#xD;
      the decrease in Ees. Because the increase in Ea is generally induced by pharmacological&#xD;
      vasoconstriction. (norepinephrine) and the consequent increase in arterial tone, a decrease&#xD;
      in Ees generally depends on the reduction in myocardial contractility. Whatever the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism, when A-V uncoupling occurs in septic shock, the cardiac energetics are&#xD;
      unfavorable and are often sacrificed to maintain tissue perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this observational trial is to validate the use of MW in septic shock patients&#xD;
      by means of consecutive echocardiographic assessment at predefined timepoints. Secondarily,&#xD;
      we'll evaluate the impact of the vasoactive drugs used in septic shock patients (vasopressors&#xD;
      and inotropes) on MW and on ventriculo-arterial coupling.&#xD;
