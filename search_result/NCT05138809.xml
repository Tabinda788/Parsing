    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test feasibility of an online platform that delivers&#xD;
      virtual exercise programs for individuals with physical disabilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample pool of this study is members of a community fitness center that serves&#xD;
      individuals with physical disabilities and chronic health conditions. The study will be&#xD;
      advertised to the members through flyers, newsletters, social media, and center's website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members logging into the center's online exercise system will be presented with a brief&#xD;
      introduction to the study and asked if they would like to &quot;Opt In&quot; to receive further&#xD;
      information. When the system receives on Opt In trigger, the member will be asked a series of&#xD;
      eligibility screening questions regarding their age, fluency in English, and whether or not&#xD;
      they have a mobility limitation or problems with gait, balance, and/or coordination. Members&#xD;
      who are not eligible will be directed back to center's online exercise system for regular&#xD;
      access to the program options. Members who are eligible will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      e-Consent form. Members who decline consent will be directed back to the center's online&#xD;
      exercise system for regular access to the program options. Members who accept consent will be&#xD;
      provided with a welcome page listing next steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After review of the welcome page, participants will be asked to complete a series of online&#xD;
      surveys that will be completed before and after 8 weeks of participation. All surveys, except&#xD;
      for the health history, are composed of Likert-scale questions. After the participant&#xD;
      completes all the surveys, the system will trigger a message to the research staff to&#xD;
      schedule an onboarding call with the participant to provide an overview of the system and&#xD;
      available online classes (live and pre-recorded). Participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
      accumulate a total of 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise throughout&#xD;
      the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be on their own to participate in virtual classes as they wish. Each&#xD;
      time the participant completes a live online class, they will be asked to complete a brief&#xD;
      survey to provide their perceptions regarding the class. Compensation in the form of a gift&#xD;
      card will be provided to participants for completion of the Pre and Post intervention&#xD;
      surveys. In addition, small incentives will be provided to the participants meeting certain&#xD;
      participation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each week, the research staff will monitor logins and post-class survey&#xD;
      responses. In the event that a participant has not logged into the system during the past 7&#xD;
      days or indicates issues via the post class survey a member of the research team will call&#xD;
      them. Coaching calls will be made at the end of Week 2, 4, and 6 as needed. If the issue is&#xD;
      lack of interest or difficulty with the existing classes, a new series of pre-recorded&#xD;
      exercise videos will be made available to the participant for remainder of the eight weeks.&#xD;
      This option will only be available once. At the end of the 8 weeks, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete the survey package again.&#xD;
