  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the effects of yoga postures and slow, deep breathing in&#xD;
      altering oxidative stress, vascular function, and blood pressure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism by which yoga lowers blood pressure&#xD;
      in hypertensive adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free radicals and enzyme activity will be analyzed from isolated immune cells and blood&#xD;
      pressure and vascular health will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12 during&#xD;
      the interventions or control conditions. Sedentary adults (ages 40-60 years) with elevated&#xD;
      blood pressure or stage I hypertension will be recruited and randomized to 12 weeks of yoga,&#xD;
      slow, deep breathing, or waitlist control conditions. Yoga classes will be completed 3 times&#xD;
      weekly at Texas State University and slow, deep breathing interventions will be completed at&#xD;
      home 5 times weekly. Participants assigned to the waitlist/sham control group will also&#xD;
      complete 5- 20-minute breathing exercises per week at home before being re-randomization at&#xD;
      week 12. Three testing sessions will be completed at the beginning of the study: 1)&#xD;
      familiarization and screening for elevated blood pressure or hypertension and other exclusion&#xD;
      criteria; 2) confirmation of elevated blood pressure or hypertension via addition seated&#xD;
      blood pressure measurements and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and 3-day physical activity&#xD;
      monitoring; and 3) blood marker assessment and endothelial function measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 4-week intervals throughout the 12-week data&#xD;
      collection period in all 3 groups. At each follow up visit after randomization, testing will&#xD;
      be completed over the course of 2 sessions: 1) ambulatory blood pressure monitor and physical&#xD;
      activity monitoring and 2) blood marker and endothelial function measurements. At the end of&#xD;
      the waitlist sham/control period, waitlisted participants will be rerandomized to yoga or&#xD;
      slow, deep breathing interventions. Once re-randomized, participants in each group will&#xD;
      complete follow up testing 4,8, and 12 weeks into their respective interventions.&#xD;
