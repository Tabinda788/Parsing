      To establish the relationship in the five critical X-ray time points during multilevel&#xD;
      posterior column osteotomies (MPCO) spinal deformity realignment in patients with adult&#xD;
      spinal deformity and to follow the participants longitudinally to examine any follow-up&#xD;
      X-rays and clinical data to compare to the post-operative standing scan and pre-operative&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies in adult spinal deformity (ASD) have found that the presence of sagittal imbalance&#xD;
      directly correlates with worsening quality of life. Multilevel posterior column osteotomies&#xD;
      (MPCOs) is a technique that can provide correction to adult spinal deformity. MPCOs can be&#xD;
      utilized for revision surgery as an alternative to 3-column osteotomies and have the ability&#xD;
      to aggregate large amount of lordosis segmentally. The success of the MPCO technique largely&#xD;
      depends on radiographs taken during these surgeries to aid the surgeon in establishing the&#xD;
      best screw and rod placement and making intraoperative adjustments. Imaging plays a vital&#xD;
      role in evaluating hardware positioning and assessing hardware integrity as well as&#xD;
      evaluating potential complication. The investigator plans to evaluate and establish the&#xD;
      relationship in the five critical X-ray time points (preoperative standing and supine,&#xD;
      intraoperative pre- and post-correction, and postoperative standing films) during MPCO spinal&#xD;
      deformity realignment and measure pre- to post-operative outcome longitudinally. The&#xD;
      investigator will investigate lumbar lordosis and sagittal and coronal alignment at those 5&#xD;
      time points and examine the relationship between pre-op, intra-op, and post-op images to&#xD;
      understand impact of the MPCO technique and examine expected outcome to final outcome.&#xD;
      Additionally, if the O-Arm 2D long film scanner is utilized during the surgery, the&#xD;
      investigator will analyze that film and compare it to the other X-rays taken.&#xD;
