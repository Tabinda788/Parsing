  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio), multicenter, comparative and phase II&#xD;
      study, conducted in patients with unresectable advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors&#xD;
      (GIST) after failure of imatinib (disease progression),sunitinib and regorafenib (either&#xD;
      disease progression or intolerance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first arm, patients will be treated with imatinib + atezolizumab (experimental arm),&#xD;
      whereas in the second arm, patients will be treated with imatinib alone (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison between this two arms will allow to compare whether or not atezolizumab and&#xD;
      imatinib is efficient for disease control, in terms of Progression-Free Survival improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio), multicenter, comparative and phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unresectable advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) will be accrued&#xD;
      after the failure of standard treatments (imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For imatinib, failure is defined as disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For sunitinib and regorafenib, failure is defined as disease progression and/or&#xD;
           intolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization (1:1 ratio) will be stratified according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tumor KIT (exon 11) mutational status: wild type or mutated&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENTS :&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period (12 months maximum), all patients will receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imatinib per os 400 mg daily continuously associated with intravenous administrations of&#xD;
           atezolizumab at the fixed dose of 1200 mg every 3 weeks (experimental arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or imatinib alone, per os 400 mg daily continuously (control arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison between this two arms will allow to compare whether or not atezolizumab and&#xD;
      imatinib is efficient for disease control, in terms of Progression-Free Survival improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 110 patients will be randomized (55 per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected a 6-month PFS rate of 10% in the standard arm (imatinib alone). Thus, a&#xD;
      6-month PFS-rate of 30% is a clinically significant target for patient treated with imatinib&#xD;
      associated to immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim safety analysis is planned to be conducted after 6-month follow-up of the 12th&#xD;
      patient has been randomized (approximately 6 patients by arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and will be described in terms of median&#xD;
      PFS along with the associated 2-sided 95% CIs for the estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFS distributions will be compared between the 2 study arms using a stratified Log-Rank test&#xD;
      by tumor mutational status of KIT - exon 11 (stratification factors used for the&#xD;
      randomisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ENTRY, DATA MANAGEMENT AND STUDY MONITORING :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data concerning the patients will be recorded in the electronic case report form&#xD;
      (eCRF) throughout the study. Serious adverse event (SAE) and Adverse Event of Specific&#xD;
      Interest (AESI) reporting will be also paper-based by e-mail and/or Fax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will perform the study monitoring and will help the investigators to conduct the&#xD;
      study in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and local&#xD;
      law requirements.&#xD;
