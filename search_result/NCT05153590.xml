  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating weight loss and treatment patterns associated with the use of&#xD;
      Saxenda® in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the weight loss associated with Saxenda® in patients with&#xD;
      obesity or overweight. Saxenda® was prescribed to participants by study doctor independently&#xD;
      of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 4 months, where the data will be collected from the available&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional activities expected from participants in the scope of study&#xD;
      because it is a chart-review study.&#xD;
