  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forensic odontology is a branch of forensic science that utilizes a dentist's expertise in&#xD;
      identification of individuals for whom traditional methods of identification aren't&#xD;
      accessible due to a lack of common identification features. Medico-legal issues, natural&#xD;
      catastrophes such as tsunamis, earthquakes, and explosions, death verification in monetary&#xD;
      concerns, religious and social reasons are all examples of situations that require&#xD;
      identification. Age, stature, sex and ethnicity are the &quot;big four&quot; determinants of personal&#xD;
      identification. Dental age estimation has the benefit of that teeth are less influenced by&#xD;
      external physical, chemical, or mechanical variables than other portions of the skeleton.&#xD;
      Secondary dentin deposition in human teeth progresses with age that results in reduction in&#xD;
      the size of the tooth pulp cavity which can be assessed as an age indicator. A significant&#xD;
      relationship between pulp width and age was originally discovered in a study by Kvaal et al.,&#xD;
      1995 who created regression formulae for age prediction using periapical radiograph by&#xD;
      measuring of pulp size. Also, the assessment of pulp/tooth volume ratio relying on the&#xD;
      gradual reduction in pulp volume produced by continuous apposition of dentin during life is&#xD;
      one well-known dental age estimation approach. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides&#xD;
      accurate three-dimensional images of the maxillofacial area. In addition, CBCT may be&#xD;
      beneficial in some forensic situations, as it has massive benefits for post-mortem forensic&#xD;
      imaging, as it offers skeletal imaging with high resolution, cheap cost, simplicity and&#xD;
      portability. CBCT can be used in forensic age assessment since it is non-invasive and allows&#xD;
      for the reconstruction of images in multiple planes to display anatomical and imaged elements&#xD;
      in distinct planes. Our hypothesis is that pulp space analysis is totally different between&#xD;
      different ages and that there is a correlation between age and pulp space analysis that could&#xD;
      be of a forensic significance for age estimation in the investigated population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this observational cross-sectional study, cone beam computed tomography scans will be&#xD;
      recruited that are with the required complement of teeth and in the age range between 20 and&#xD;
      60 years then, correlation between chronological age versus cone beam computed tomography age&#xD;
      through pulp space analysis will be done by two methods which are linear measurements and&#xD;
      volumetric measurements of pulp and tooth size. First, linear measurements will be done&#xD;
      according to kvaal's et al approach, measurements from mandibular lateral incisors, canines&#xD;
      and first premolars and maxillary central and lateral incisors and second premolars were most&#xD;
      strongly correlated with age, so these teeth will be selected for the investigation. A paired&#xD;
      t-test on these measurements showed that there were no significant differences between teeth&#xD;
      from the left and the right side of the jaw. Consequently, teeth from either the left or the&#xD;
      right side will be chosen, whichever will be best suited for measurement. Not knowing the age&#xD;
      and gender of the individual, the following measurements will be carried out on the&#xD;
      radiographs of all six types of teeth: the maximum tooth length (T), pulp length and root&#xD;
      length (R) on the mesial surface from the enamel-cementum junction (ECJ) to the root apex,&#xD;
      the root and pulp width both at the ECJ (level A) and at the midroot level, i.e. halfway&#xD;
      between the ECJ and the apex of the root (level C), as well as at the midpoint between the&#xD;
      ECJ and midroot level (level B). Second, volumetric Measurements will be done to calculate&#xD;
      pulp/ tooth volume ratio.&#xD;
