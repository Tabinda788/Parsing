  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to test whether a text-based e-triage can safely minimize the time&#xD;
      associated with routine cancer care by identifying patients who can proceed directly to their&#xD;
      immunotherapy infusion without a preceding in-person office assessment.&#xD;

    <description>For patients in the intervention arm, symptoms and laboratory results will be assessed using the text-based e-triage 96 hours prior to their intended infusion date. The e-triage will consist of a standardized questionnaire and algorithm to evaluate symptoms and laboratory values. Patients with acceptable labs and minimal or no symptoms can opt to proceed directly to their immunotherapy infusion without an in-person office assessment.</description>

    <description>The e-triage will consist of 16 questions, modified from the validated NCI Pro-CTCAETM, which will be sent to patients via WaytoHealthÂ©'s two-way texting system 96 hours prior to their scheduled immunotherapy infusion. Questions will pertain to common or emergent immune related adverse events as defined by the NCCN guidelines and two senior disease experts. Patients will be prompted via text to measure the presence and severity of symptoms over the week prior. A final question will be included to capture any additional symptoms patients wish to disclose.</description>
