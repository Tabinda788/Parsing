  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim is to conduct a multi-center, Bayesian, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      primary technical success of coils and vascular plugs for proximal splenic artery&#xD;
      embolization in the setting of high-grade splenic trauma. The investigator has previously&#xD;
      demonstrated the feasibility of such a study in a single center pilot trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Splenic preservation rates are improved for participants with high-grade splenic injuries&#xD;
      (defined as Grade III-V injuries by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST)&#xD;
      guidelines) when non-operative management is supplemented by image-guided, trans-catheter&#xD;
      splenic artery embolization (SAE). SAE is currently the standard of care for hemodynamically&#xD;
      stable participants with high-grade splenic injuries. In proximal SAE (pSAE), the mid-splenic&#xD;
      artery is embolized between the origins of the dorsal pancreatic artery and pancreatica magna&#xD;
      artery with either endovascular plugs (VPs) or endovascular coils (EC). This reduces the&#xD;
      intra-splenic arterial pressure which allows the parenchyma time to heal. Splenic perfusion&#xD;
      is maintained via a collateral pathway consisting of flow from the splenic artery proximal to&#xD;
      the site of embolization through the smaller dorsal pancreatic artery to the transverse&#xD;
      pancreatic artery to the pancreatica magna artery which then delivers a slower, smaller&#xD;
      amount of blood to the splenic artery distal to the site of embolization. Additionally,&#xD;
      collateral supply from the short gastric and gastroepiploic arteries helps to protect the&#xD;
      spleen from infarction and/or abscess formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      pSAE is most often accomplished using either VPs or ECs as the embolic agent, both of which&#xD;
      are FDA-approved and clinically-available. ECs have a long history of efficacy and safety for&#xD;
      embolization and are thus familiar embolic agents to most endovascular specialists. Further,&#xD;
      coils large enough to embolize the mid-splenic artery can be deployed through a standard&#xD;
      micro-catheter, which means they can be used in even the most tortuous splenic arteries.&#xD;
      However, multiple coils may need to be deployed in the same patient to achieve hemostasis in&#xD;
      the mid-splenic artery that may increase their overall cost, iodinated contrast use,&#xD;
      procedural time, and the radiation exposure to the participant and medical staff.&#xD;
      Additionally, given the high-flow nature of the splenic artery, even an appropriately sized&#xD;
      coil may migrate distally. A typical pSAE using coils will involve the deployment of one&#xD;
      helical coil followed by multiple packing coils until hemostasis is achieved. VPs attempt to&#xD;
      overcome the limitations of coils. For example, the deployment of a single VP can typically&#xD;
      provide hemostasis in the mid-splenic artery which theoretically reduces procedural time,&#xD;
      contrast load, and radiation exposure. Despite this, VPs are usually more expensive than&#xD;
      coils on a per unit basis and are usually less familiar devices to endovascular specialists.&#xD;
      Another drawback of VPs is that they cannot be deployed through a standard micro-catheter but&#xD;
      rather require the advancement of a larger, stiffer 0.035 inch system into the mid-splenic&#xD;
      artery. This may limit their use in very tortuous splenic arteries. Currently, the selection&#xD;
      of embolic agent for pSAE is primarily based on operator experience and preference. The&#xD;
      embolic efficacy, technical success, and cost of using coils compared to VPs has been&#xD;
      evaluated in other diseases; yet, to the best of our knowledge, these embolic agents have&#xD;
      never been compared for their use in pSAE, much less in a randomized, prospective fashion.&#xD;
