    <description>The ALV1 system is designed to create a controlled size interatrial shunt via a proprietary intra-cardiac catheter. There is no temporary or permanent implant used to create or maintain the interatrial shunt. The therapy is intended to be delivered in a single procedure administered under general anesthesia in a cardiac catheterization laboratory.</description>
