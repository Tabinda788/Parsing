  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most non-communicable diseases are partially affected by low-grade chronic inflammation.&#xD;
      Research has shown that sulforaphane, an ingredient found in abundance in broccoli, shows&#xD;
      promise as a potent anti-inflammatory substance. However, its potential in the settings of&#xD;
      the caloric-induced inflammatory response has not been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators aim to assess the efficacy of sulforaphane on&#xD;
      biomarkers of inflammation and other markers of phenotypic flexibility in healthy&#xD;
      participants subjected to the standardized 'PhenFlex' challenge. Study design: Double-blind,&#xD;
      crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled, intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy human volunteers (18-50 years old) Intervention: Participants will&#xD;
      receive 16 grams (intervention) of broccoli sprouts (BroccoCress®) and 16 grams of Affilla&#xD;
      Cress® (placebo) on different occasions in randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint of the present study is to demonstrate&#xD;
      that sulforaphane can influence endothelial activation measured as changes in plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of sVCAM and sICAM in a caloric challenge test in healthy participants. Nature&#xD;
      and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Use of BroccoCress® in human subjects has not been related to adverse effects,&#xD;
      except of the individuals who show individual intolerance to cruciferous vegetables. Those&#xD;
      individuals will not be permitted into the study. The 'PhenFlex', a high-fat, high-glucose,&#xD;
      high-calorie drink, is used for the caloric load. The PhenFlex has been used in three studies&#xD;
      before, with no side effects reported after consumption. Sampling of venous blood can&#xD;
      potentially cause complications (haematoma formation, fainting, etc). The procedures involved&#xD;
      in this study will include an interview, assessment of vital signs, completion of the study&#xD;
      related questionnaires and collection of blood and urine samples. Volunteers will receive an&#xD;
      unsubstantial financial reward for the participation in this study. The results will provide&#xD;
      information on whether the intake of cruciferous vegetables rich in sulforaphane can increase&#xD;
      resilience to excessive inflammatory stimuli associated with caloric overload and potentially&#xD;
      provide evidence on the role of dietary ingredients in combating chronic low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 8±3</time_frame>
    <description>The systemic low-grade inflammation score (SIS). The SIS score will be constructed from:&#xD;
Biomarkers that represent metabolic tissue inflammation (IL-1b,IL-6,and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-a])&#xD;
Biomarkers of immune cell recruitment (C-C motif ligand-2[CCL-2]),IL-8, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1], soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [sVCAM-1])&#xD;
Biomarkers of inflammation resolution(IL-10, adiponectin)&#xD;
Biomarkers of overall inflammation (CRPandIL-12p70).&#xD;
A SIS will be generated summing the z-score log-transformed inflammatory biomarkers plasma concentration (CRP, IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p70, TNF-a, CCL-2, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1). The Z-score log-transformed plasma adiponectin and IL-10 levels will be subtracted from SIS because of their well-known anti-inflammatory functions.</description>

    <description>HRV will be assessed in short term (5 min) ECG recording obtained in supine position and analysed as recommended by current standards (ESC / NASPE, 1996). Total power (TP), high-frequency power (HF), low frequency power (LF), and very low- frequency power (VLF) will be derived from the spectral analysis. Also, the following time domain indices will be assessed: standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN); square root of the mean squared differences of successive RR interval, (RMSSD); percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals exceeding 50 milliseconds (pNN50). The recordings of ECG will be performed 4 times: (i) before administration of investigational product; (ii) before administration of PhenFlex; (iii) 30 min after administration of PhenFlex; (iv) 2 hours administration of PhenFlex.</description>

    <description>Potential participants will be screened after showing their interest to participate to the study. When they are considered eligible to participate (after a phone call with the executing researcher), participants will be randomized into one of the two groups in this study: either consuming the broccoli sprouts on day one (visit 1) and the placebo product in the second visit, or the other way around (placebo product on day 1 and the intervention during the second visit). Both days, participants will consume the PhenFlex, the challenge product with the high caloric load. This will allow for analyzing the effectiveness of the intervention on different biomarkers of chronic, low-grade inflammation, with the main objective being on endothelial activation.</description>
