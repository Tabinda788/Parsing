  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project proposes a novel approach to elucidate the biological adaptations&#xD;
      associated with Alcohol Use Disorder and to assess whether such adaptations are predictive of&#xD;
      higher alcohol craving in response to both alcohol cues and stressors and higher relapse risk&#xD;
      and alcohol use in the real world.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will use intensive longitudinal data collection and analysis across multiple data streams.&#xD;
      We will recruit 25 treatment-seeking individuals with AUD and 25 light social drinkers&#xD;
      matched on demographically relevant variables (i.e., age, gender, IQ, race). We will use&#xD;
      smartphones to assess subjects' alcohol use and experiences in real-time via ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA). During three consecutive days of these two weeks, we propose&#xD;
      using passive biomonitoring to collect real-time cardiovascular responses, i.e., heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV), and alcohol use via unobtrusive monitors (i.e., Firstbeat Bodyguard 2,&#xD;
      BACtrack Skyn) with scheduled salivary cortisol samples. Individuals with AUD will then be&#xD;
      provided with four weeks of behavioral treatment with daily assessments. During the final two&#xD;
      weeks of treatment, individuals with AUD will complete another three-day period of intensive&#xD;
      self-reports, including another 72-hours physiological and salivary cortisol monitoring.&#xD;

    <measure>Rating of subjective craving in the real world</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days for individuals with AUD, 14 days for social drinkers</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) their current levels of craving, if they have drank alcohol, and if they experienced a stressor. These reports will be generated in three different ways: at 8 am and 8 pm at night, at four random times during waking hours, and while drinking alcohol. Individuals with AUD will be compared to social drinkers in their differences in real-world ratings of stress and craving. Craving and stress will be assessed using a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS) in which 0=&quot;Not at all&quot; and 100=&quot;Extremely High.&quot;</description>

    <description>Participants who meet the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder will complete six weeks of smartphone monitoring. During this monitoring period, they will also complete two three-consecutive days of intensive monitoring including more frequent smartphone surveys, saliva samples, heart rate monitoring, and an alcohol use monitor.</description>

    <description>During intake, a research assistant will demonstrate how to place the HRV monitor, BACtrak Skyn, and provide instructions on completing the saliva samples at home. Participants will wear the HRV and Skyn monitors for three consecutive, randomly selected days twice for individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder and once for social drinkers during the study (72 hours each). Participants will be provided with six saliva sample collection tubes per day with explicit directions on when the saliva sampling should occur (hours since waking: +0, +1, +2, +4, +6, +10 hours, and before going to sleep). Participants will also complete a subjective report using similar questions included in the survey prompts at the same scheduled time as the saliva sample. Individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder would complete a total of 6 such days during the study, and social drinkers would complete a total of 3 such days during the study.</description>
