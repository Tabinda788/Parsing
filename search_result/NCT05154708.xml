  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 85,000 people in France. Medical care for this disease&#xD;
      represents 2% of the Health Insurance budget.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on dialysis frequently experience severe or overwhelming symptoms which contributes&#xD;
      to poor health related quality of life (HRQoL). However, taking into account the measurement&#xD;
      of the patients' symptoms by the patients themselves would allow to improve their HRQoL by&#xD;
      putting more emphasis on the results that matter the most to the patients. It would also&#xD;
      improve information and decision-making between nephrology care team and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic use of patients reported outcomes measures (PROMs) is not widely used due to a&#xD;
      number of barriers including logistics and feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will the F-SWIFT Pilot project address the barriers associated with PROMs? By choosing&#xD;
      short questionnaires to complete By providing feedback on the severity of symptoms to the&#xD;
      dialysis team and to patients By making links to good practice recommendations included in&#xD;
      the feedback Allowing electronic collection of PROMs The research question therefore asks&#xD;
      whether regular symptom monitoring with feedback to dialysis staff improves dialysis&#xD;
      patient's outcomes? To do this, a pilot study must be carried out with the following main&#xD;
      objectives Test the feasibility of integrating electronic measurements of PROMs with feedback&#xD;
      to the dialysis team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three centers are participating in this pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The nephrology department of the Nancy CHRU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Lorraine Association for the Treatment of Renal Insufficiency (ALTIR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The nephrology department of the Nîmes University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will take place in 2 phases :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 To identify the needs and expectations of patients and health professionals in&#xD;
      relation to a systematic electronic measurement of symptoms made by the patients themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups (interviews) will be conducted with patients (n=15) and healthcare professionals&#xD;
      (n=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (n=50-60 patients) To develop and test an electronic PROMs system allowing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect patients' symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify patients with severe symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alert the dialysis team in case of severe symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suggest appropriate management strategies&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients reported outcomes (PROs) are defined as any measure of a patient's health status&#xD;
      reported directly by the patient, without interpretation by health care professionals or&#xD;
      others. It is how the patient feels about their health condition or treatment. Although&#xD;
      assessing patients' well-being and managing their symptoms are the foundations of clinical&#xD;
      care, the care patients receive often does not meet their needs. For example, healthcare&#xD;
      professionals are often unaware of the presence and severity of their patients' symptoms. The&#xD;
      integration of PROs into clinical trials, clinical care, and quality of care assessment stems&#xD;
      from the need to place greater emphasis on the outcomes that matter most to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, primary clinical trial endpoints and efficacy metrics in nephrology have been&#xD;
      dominated by objective biochemical and process measures (percentage of patients with&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula). These measures fail to reflect what constitutes a good outcome from&#xD;
      the patient's perspective, and ultimately there is often very little information about how&#xD;
      treatments or any other interventions affect the patient's experience A growing number of&#xD;
      studies report a high frequency of symptoms in adult dialysis patients. Patients frequently&#xD;
      present with signs of severe pain, fatigue, nausea, cramping, itching, sleep disturbance, and&#xD;
      depression, which are strongly associated with poor quality of life. More than half of&#xD;
      patients experience fatigue, pruritus (relentless itching), and constipation despite&#xD;
      available effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In nephrology, studies have focused on survival or biomarker studies and very little on&#xD;
      interventions to improve what was a priority for patients, i.e., treating their symptoms and&#xD;
      improving their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous experiments have been conducted in other fields such as oncology. These studies have&#xD;
      shown a real benefit of taking into account measures of perceived health on improving symptom&#xD;
      management, treatment side effects and patient survival. Patients for whom regular perceived&#xD;
      health follow-up with feedback to oncologists is implemented have a better survival than with&#xD;
      traditional follow-up. This is mainly explained by earlier identification and management of&#xD;
      symptoms (preventing or reducing the occurrence of downstream adverse events) or side effects&#xD;
      of chemotherapy (allowing better tolerance and adherence to the full chemotherapy regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with dialysis have poorer survival than&#xD;
      patients with certain cancers and a particularly degraded quality of life. Symptoms reported&#xD;
      by dialysis patients are often underestimated or even unrecognized by the dialysis team for a&#xD;
      variety of reasons. Therefore, it seems possible to improve patient management, outcome, and&#xD;
      quality of life through better consideration of symptoms provided the dialysis team is aware&#xD;
      of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many questions are still open. Which PRO to measure? How should it be measured? How to store&#xD;
      and use the data? How to interpret the results? How can they be integrated with other&#xD;
      measures in patient management and treatment decisions? The impact of routine PRO&#xD;
      measurements is controversial, especially because of methodological biases in the various&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical trial will be set up and nested in the national RIEN registry, entitled F-SWIFT&#xD;
      (French-Symptom monitoring WIth Feedback Trial) to improve symptom management in order to&#xD;
      address the unmet needs of dialysis CKD patients and improve their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question posed is whether regular self-reported symptom monitoring with&#xD;
      immediate feedback and management recommendations to the dialysis team improves the outcome&#xD;
      of dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The F-SWIFT study is the French side of the Australian SWIFT study which has obtained funding&#xD;
      and started in 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      irst, some technical and logistical feasibility questions need to be answered to adapt the&#xD;
      SWIFT study to the French context. Indeed, to date, the PRO measurement is not a routine&#xD;
      measurement in dialysis facilities. It therefore seems important to approach patients and&#xD;
      professionals to explore their expectations and needs in terms of integrating PRO as a&#xD;
      routine management indicator. The first phase is therefore the realization of a pilot study,&#xD;
      which is the subject of this protocol.&#xD;
