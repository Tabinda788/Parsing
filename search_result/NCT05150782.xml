  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food supplements like curcumin and boswellia serrata have been used traditionally for&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory purposes. A well-known problem of these substances in their natural form is&#xD;
      the low bioavailability. Micellization of these substances has been shown to increase the&#xD;
      bioavailability significantly and thereby the clinical efficacy. The clinical value of these&#xD;
      micellized substances has been presented in numerous clinical studies and in particular in&#xD;
      patients with acute COVID-19. This study aims to examine the effect of a mixture of&#xD;
      micellized curcumin, boswellia serrata and ascorbic acid on patients with long COVID.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will be asked to take the micellized supplements daily, at home for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      During this 6 weeks several questionnaires will be taken to asses general health-related&#xD;
      quality of life. Follow-up measurements will be done at 24 weeks.&#xD;
