  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) poses a major public health problem. E. coli is not only a&#xD;
      commensal of the digestive tract but also a major opportunistic pathogen, first cause of&#xD;
      urinary tract infections, first cause of bacteremia. However, little is known about the&#xD;
      dynamics of intestinal colonization of the human host. Understanding the dynamics of&#xD;
      colonization is crucial because selection for the major traits of E. coli is antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance and virulence (the propensity to cause infection) works in commensalism, in the&#xD;
      gut, not in infections. This study will make possible for the first time to study the&#xD;
      colonization dynamics of E. coli in a large healthy host population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to quantify the succession (gain, loss or replacement) of E. coli&#xD;
      strains in the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers and how it depends on the properties of&#xD;
      the host and the bacteria. This study will thus provide a better understanding of the E.&#xD;
      Coli's epidemiological dynamics and the development of certain traits such as antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this goal, the study will take place in two successive phases :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first pilot phase will first be conducted with 50 healthy volunteers. During this pilot&#xD;
      phase, a stool sample will be taken. The strains isolated during this pilot phase will be&#xD;
      sequenced, making possible to characterize the strains present and the strains' possible&#xD;
      changes between two stool samples. Succession rates will be estimated. The optimal sampling&#xD;
      rate that maximizes accuracy in estimating succession rates will be identified and retained&#xD;
      for the second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second phase, a prospective cohort study will also be conducted in 200 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this second phase, healthy volunteers who participated in the first phase will be able&#xD;
      to continue their participation and new volunteers will be selected. The healthy volunteers&#xD;
      included in the prospective cohort study will be followed up with visits and stool samples&#xD;
      which will be defined according to the results of the pilot phase.&#xD;

      Escherichia Coli poses a major public health problem. E. Coli is not only a commensal of the&#xD;
      digestive tract but also a major opportunistic pathogen, first cause of urinary tract&#xD;
      infections, first cause of bacteremia. However, little is known about the dynamics of&#xD;
      intestinal colonization of the human host. Understanding the dynamics of colonization is&#xD;
      crucial because selection for the major traits of E. coli is antibiotic resistance and&#xD;
      virulence (the propensity to cause infection) works in commensalism, in the gut, not in&#xD;
      infections. This study will make possible for the first time to study the colonization&#xD;
      dynamics of E. coli in a large healthy host population. In particular, we will quantify how&#xD;
      the loss or gain of certain strains in the intestine depends on the properties of the host&#xD;
      and the bacteria. This study will thus provide a better understanding of the E. coli's&#xD;
      epidemiological dynamics and the development of certain traits such as antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective and criterion The main objective of this research is to quantify the&#xD;
      succession (gain, loss or replacement) of E. coli strains in the gut microbiota in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and criteria The secondary objective is to study the intra-host&#xD;
      evolution of E. coli by focusing on the evolution of clones colonizing the same host for long&#xD;
      periods of time. This makes possible to understand whether the intra-host evolution is&#xD;
      dominated by mutations conferring a selective advantage (such as resistance to antibiotics)&#xD;
      or on the contrary neutral mutations (having no effect on the proteins produced).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population The two phases of this study will be conducted in healthy adults of both sexes.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited from the file of healthy volunteers for biomedical&#xD;
      research at the Clinical Investigation Center (CIC) of the Bichat - Claude Bernard hospital&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical procedure This research will take place in two successive phases: A first so-called&#xD;
      pilot phase will first be conducted with healthy volunteers. During this pilot phase, 50&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will be selected and followed every 2 weeks for a stool sample. The pilot&#xD;
      phase will include 10 visits for a total duration of 18 weeks per volunteer. The strains&#xD;
      isolated during this pilot phase will be sequenced, making possible to characterize the&#xD;
      strains present and the possible changes of strains between two stool samples. Succession&#xD;
      rates will be estimated. The results of this phase identify the optimal sampling rate that&#xD;
      maximizes accuracy in estimating succession rates. This will be retained for the second&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of the volunteers included in the pilot study will be broken down into 2&#xD;
      stages :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a stage of volunteers'selection at the CIC: each volunteer will have a clinical&#xD;
           examination to ensure their eligibility for participation in the research. He must meet&#xD;
           all the selection criteria on the day of this visit and sign the collection consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an 18-week follow-up period during which the volunteers go to the CIC to deposit stool&#xD;
           samples every two weeks for 18 weeks (corresponding to 10 visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second phase, a prospective cohort study will also be conducted in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      During this second phase, healthy volunteers who participated in the first phase will be able&#xD;
      to continue their participation and new volunteers will be selected.The healthy volunteers&#xD;
      included in the prospective cohort study will be followed up with visits and stool samples&#xD;
      which will be defined according to the results of the pilot phase for a period of 8 to 144&#xD;
      weeks maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of volunteers included in the cohort study will be broken down into 2&#xD;
      stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a stage for the selection of volunteers at the CIC (V1): all participants will have a&#xD;
           clinical examination to ensure their eligibility for participation in the research. They&#xD;
           must meet all the inclusion criteria available on the day of this visit and sign the&#xD;
           collection consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a follow-up period of 144 weeks maximum: 8 follow-up visits with a rhythm of 1 to 18&#xD;
           weeks, ie 8 to 144 weeks max. The volunteers will go to the CIC to deposit stool samples&#xD;
           at each of the 8 planned visits. The schedule for these 8 visits will be determined&#xD;
           based on the results of the pilot phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects selected First phase: 50 subjects Second phase: 200 subjects, ie 0 to 50&#xD;
      from the pilot phase + 150 to 200 new subjects, depending on the number of volunteers in the&#xD;
      pilot phase who wish to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers Monocentric national study: Clinical Investigation Center of the Bichat -&#xD;
      Claude Bernard hospital group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research calendar&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  duration of inclusion: 6 months (26 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  duration of participation (treatment + follow-up): 18 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  total duration: 44 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  duration of inclusion: 18 months (78 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  duration of participation (treatment + follow-up): 8 to 144 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  total duration: 86 to 222 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis To estimate the rates of gain, loss and replacement of E. coli strains&#xD;
      depending on host and bacterial factors, statistical analyzes will be performed using R&#xD;
      software within the French Institute for Health and Medical Research U722: first on the 50&#xD;
      volunteers in the pilot phase, which will allow a first estimate of these rates and define&#xD;
      thus the optimal sampling schedule for the prospective cohort phase, then on the 200&#xD;
      volunteers of this second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical model used for the two analyzes will describe the dynamics of host&#xD;
      colonization. We will assume that the host colonization state follows a discrete-state Markov&#xD;
      chain in continuous time. This mathematical model describes the transitions between the&#xD;
      different possible states, by strain gain, strain loss, and strain replacement within the&#xD;
      host. It calculates the probability of the data obtained knowing the parameters (strain&#xD;
      gains, strain loss, strain replacement) and therefore the likelihood (the probability of the&#xD;
      data knowing the model). From the likelihood, the parameters can be estimated by maximum&#xD;
      likelihood methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitatively, the parameters will be estimated by maximum likelihood and the precision will&#xD;
      be quantified by confidence intervals obtained by the likelihood profile method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dependence of the gain, loss and replacement rates on several host or bacterial variables&#xD;
      will also be estimated. The significance of the effect of a variable on the gain, loss and&#xD;
      replacement rates will be tested by model comparison: the models will be adjusted by maximum&#xD;
      likelihood. The comparison of models will be done by likelihood ratio test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the factors that are suspected a priori to be important for transition rates will be&#xD;
      tested. The level of significance of these factors will be corrected for multiple tests&#xD;
      (Bonferroni correction). In a second step, the impact of all the elements of the genome will&#xD;
      be analyzed in an exploratory way (genome-wide association study).&#xD;
