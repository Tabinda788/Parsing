      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and compare the bioavailability and therefore to assess the bioequivalence of two&#xD;
      different formulations of lamotrigine after a single oral dose administration under fasting&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to monitor the safety of the subjects.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center, randomized, single dose, laboratory-blinded, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover&#xD;
      design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-two (22) subjects will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female volunteers, non- or ex-smokers, of at least 18 years of age to 54 years of&#xD;
      age, inclusively, with a body mass index (BMI) within 22.00 to 30.00 kg/m2, inclusively, with&#xD;
      a minimum body weight of 60 kg, will be selected according to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study period, 23 blood samples will be collected. The first blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected prior to drug administration while the others will be collected up to 192 hours&#xD;
      after the drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wash-out:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug administrations will be separated by at least 28 calendar days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests during study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alcohol breath test will be performed before each period of the study. Screening for drugs&#xD;
      of abuse will be performed before each period of the study. A C-SSRS questionnaire will be&#xD;
      performed prior to each study period, as well as prior to discharge for each period of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For female subjects, a serum pregnancy test will be performed before each period of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs will be measured prior to and approximately 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours&#xD;
      following each drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological function tests will be performed approximately 30 hours after each drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, hematology tests will be performed before the 2nd period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology, general biochemistry (including a serum pregnancy test for female subjects), and&#xD;
      urinalysis tests will be repeated along with the collection of the last blood sample of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete physical examination (including vital signs) will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioanalysis: Lamotrigine plasma concentrations will be measured by a validated bioanalytical&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
