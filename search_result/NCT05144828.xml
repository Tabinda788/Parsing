  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single surgeon, prospective, randomized trial examining the addition&#xD;
      of Cryo Nerve Block during robot assisted thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic surgical procedures are consistently reported to be among the most painful surgical&#xD;
      incisions currently used. Trauma to the skin, muscle, intercostal nerves, bones and pleura&#xD;
      all contribute and lead to activation of various pain pathways including somatic, visceral,&#xD;
      neurogenic and phrenic. In the short term, this pain leads to ineffective cough and pulmonary&#xD;
      hygiene resulting in respiratory complications and prolonged hospital stays while in the&#xD;
      longer term it leads to prolonged recovery, delayed return to work and in some instances,&#xD;
      chronic post thoracotomy pain syndromes. Minimally invasive approaches such as standard&#xD;
      thoracoscopy or robotic assisted thoracoscopy have certainly decreased some of this trauma as&#xD;
      evidenced by decreased length of stays and decreased complication rates however even with&#xD;
      these minimally invasive techniques, recovery to 80% of baseline is 25 days and 9.4% of&#xD;
      patients are still using narcotics after 90-180 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several options are available in the management of pain following thoracic surgery with a&#xD;
      multimodal pain medicine approach being most common. Opioids, unfortunately, are a relatively&#xD;
      large part of this approach and are often relied upon despite their relatively unfavorable&#xD;
      adverse event profile and risk for addiction. Many of the other pain adjuncts often used with&#xD;
      thoracotomies such as epidural catheters or intraoperatively placed pain catheters are not&#xD;
      really reasonable when using minimally invasive approaches as the hospital length of stay is&#xD;
      1-2 days. Intercostal cryoanalgesia has been shown to be a safe and effective strategy for&#xD;
      postoperative pain management in patients undergoing thoracotomy. Recent studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the beneficial effect of cryoanalgesia for post-thoracotomy pain in reduction of&#xD;
      opioid requirement, reduction in post-operative pain scores, and superior pulmonary function&#xD;
      (higher FEV1 and FVC values)5 and that it can produce temporary neurolysis for up to two&#xD;
      months without long-term histological nerve damage. To date it has not been studied when&#xD;
      using minimally invasive techniques whether it be standard thoracoscopy or robotic assisted&#xD;
      thoracoscopy but it would stand to reason that it would be equally or maybe more effective in&#xD;
      this patient population and truly maximize the benefits of a minimally invasive approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to assess whether intra-operative intercostal cryoanalgesia using the&#xD;
      cryoICE® probe provides superior post-operative analgesia as compared to our current standard&#xD;
      pain management strategy in patients undergoing robotic assisted thoracoscopic anatomic lung&#xD;
      resection and allows for decreased opioid use and more rapid recovery.&#xD;
