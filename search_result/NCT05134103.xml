  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Utilization of therapist Assisted internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (TAiCBT)&#xD;
      for treating depression and anxiety disorders in stepped-care models, such as the UK's&#xD;
      Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and the Ontario Structured Psychotherapy&#xD;
      Program (SPP), is a potential solution for addressing the treatment gap in mental health.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to investigate the effectiveness of Beacon TAiCBT for Depression to&#xD;
      demonstrate the potential value of TAiCBT in a stepped care model. Investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a 12-week pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 (iCBT intervention:&#xD;
      waiting-list) allocation, for participants referred to the Anxiety and Mood, Prompt Anxiety&#xD;
      and Mood, and Trauma Programs at Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences and on a&#xD;
      waiting-list to receive clinical service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures will be the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)&#xD;
      definitions of Recovery, Reliable Improvement, and Reliable Recovery which are derived using&#xD;
      the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 . The PHQ-9 (Depression), GAD-7 (anxiety) and WSAS (functional&#xD;
      impairment) will be used as secondary outcome measures for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the study, 200 participants will be randomized (iCBT, 100; waiting-list,&#xD;
      100). Statistical analyses will include intention-to-treat analyses to test the interaction&#xD;
      effects for the primary outcome measures at discharge/12-weeks and 3, and 12 months&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is predicted that participants in the treatment condition will show significantly reduced&#xD;
      symptoms of depression related to the waitlist control. It is predicted that this will be&#xD;
      maintained through follow up.&#xD;

    <measure>Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) - (Change between Baseline and Post-treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at baseline (initial screening) and post-treatment (week 12 of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a simple, reliable and valid measure of impaired functioning. It is a 5-item self-report measure that provides an experiential impact of a disorder from the patient's point of view. It looks at how the disorder impairs the patient's ability to function day to day on five dimensions: work, social life, home life, private life and close relationships. This scale ranges from 0-40 with 40 indicating a severe level of functional impairment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mindbeacon Therapist Guided, Internet Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression</intervention_name>
    <description>The treatment consists of 11 depression modules delivered approximately once per week (at therapists' discretion) over a period of 12 weeks. Additionally, the therapist typically tailors treatment to client's individual needs by including supplementary modules for a variety of issues such as generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety, post-traumatic stress, insomnia, pain, and relationships etc. Clients can complete the readings, exercises, and worksheets at any convenient time, using their web-enabled smartphone, tablet, or computer. Access to the modules and all messaging is provided through the secure platform. Messaging is &quot;asynchronous&quot; meaning participants can message their therapist as often as they choose and expect a response within 1-2 business days. After 12 weeks of active treatment, they will have unguided access (without therapist support) to the treatment materials that were covered for an additional 40 weeks.</description>
