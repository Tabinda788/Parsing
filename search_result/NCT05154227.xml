  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate body-weight and behavioural trajectories, as well as their&#xD;
      underlying individual, social, and environmental determinants from University to early&#xD;
      working life. The study employs mHealth approaches in the form of a smartphone app and smart&#xD;
      wearables to collect health behaviour and related information to answer the following&#xD;
      research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To what extend do health behaviours (activity, diet, and sleep), body weight, and mental&#xD;
           well-being change during the transition from university to early working life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the relationship between health behaviours and mental well-being, and how does&#xD;
           it differ at different stages of the transition from University to early working life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the determinants of physical activity, healthy eating and sleep in university&#xD;
           students and young working adults?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do these determinants differ at different stages of the student to work life transition?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If so, how do these differences in these determinants relate to changes in health&#xD;
           behaviours, weight status, and mental well-being?&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort study. The study period for each participant is 2 years.&#xD;
      Participants are required to download the study's smartphone app and wear the assigned&#xD;
      smartwatch to collect various information (including step counts and sleep time). Physical&#xD;
      measurements are taken in person at baseline, 12 months and 24 months visits. These&#xD;
      measurements include height, weight, waist circumference, resting heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires administered at baseline, 12 months and 24 months include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (age, gender, religion, socio-economic status, education level)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary intake and habits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity, sedentary behavior and screen time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active and passive transport use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking habit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental health and wellness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women's health-related&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also receive occasional surveys sent to their smartphone through the study&#xD;
      app. These surveys will include questions about sleep, diet, technology use, binge drinking,&#xD;
      smoking, physical activities and/or emotions.&#xD;
