    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the project is to characterize the diagnosis, care and outcomes of&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer in unique ethnic cohorts in greater Jerusalem, with a focus on the&#xD;
      Arab population and ultra-orthodox Jewish population and to improve and streamline care of&#xD;
      women from multi-ethnic backgrounds by further understanding barriers to healthcare access.&#xD;
      At completion, the collected data will enable planning of culturally appropriate and&#xD;
      strategic programs that are culturally tailored to improve the standard of care, outcomes and&#xD;
      healthcare access for women living with advanced breast cancer from these unique cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: Ultra-orthodox Jewish and Arab patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical &amp; psychosocial characterization of ultra-orthodox Jewish and Arab women&#xD;
           individuals ABC (including clinical characteristic &amp; treatment, outcomes, access and&#xD;
           inclusion in clinical trials) along the advanced breast cancer journey&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate and identify modes of access to care and barriers to breast cancer care for&#xD;
           this population - individually communally, cultural-religiously and professionally&#xD;
           (including healthcare professionals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Develop a model for improving health care access and advocacy, tailored to each&#xD;
           communities needs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Apply the knowledge to developing education training and health promotion - including&#xD;
           for the individual, community leadership, and healthcare providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Optimize access to clinical trial participation and reduce any disparities in clinical&#xD;
           trial recruitment and participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Develop and tailor culturally appropriate psycho-social interventions to improve&#xD;
           psychological wellbeing and quality of life&#xD;

      Project design &amp; methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will include several key aspects with a mixed-methods approach including both&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A retropective registry of all women with newly diagnosed breast cancer and advanced&#xD;
           breast cancer (either de novo or recurrent disease) documenting all clinical disease and&#xD;
           treatment characteristics and outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gather institutional data on clinical trial recruitment and representation of the&#xD;
           ethnic-religious groups under-study. As this is assessed retrospectively, the&#xD;
           classification into ethnic-religious sub-groups will be determined by suburb of&#xD;
           residence (In Jerusalem ultra-orthodox Jewish and Arab populations in Jerusalem live in&#xD;
           distinct homogenous suburbs, distinct from those of the secular Jewish population - this&#xD;
           has been demonstrated to be a reliable approach in Jerusalem). Data will be collected on&#xD;
           patients recruited between 1/1/2012 until 30/6/2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gather data on quality of life, general well-being, spiritual well-being, information&#xD;
           receipt along the advanced breast cancer journey for all patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
           advanced breast cancer and compare between the different ethnic groups/cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A.1 - Data Collection Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Data will be collected for a retropective registry of all women with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      breast cancer and advanced breast cancer (either de novo or recurrent disease) between&#xD;
      1.1.18-30.6.21 documenting all clinical disease and treatment characteristics and outcome.&#xD;
      Data will be collected from the &quot;Mahar&quot; electronic medical record based on lists of all new&#xD;
      intakes and all patients with newly recurrent disease that are maintained in the breast&#xD;
      oncology unit. Patient identity will be coded and saved anonymously in the data file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A.2 - Data Collection (Appendix 2) Methods Patients documented in the Hadassah &quot;Mahar&quot;&#xD;
      to have participated in a clinical oncology trial between 1/1/2012 until 30.6.2021 will be&#xD;
      included. Patient identity will be coded and these details will be stored in a separate file.&#xD;
      The data collection file will include anonymized patient data. Data collection will include&#xD;
      data describing patients' socioeconomic status including gender, date and country of birth,&#xD;
      religion, neighborhood and family status. Clinical data about the oncological diagnosis,&#xD;
      management and course of disease as well data about the clinical trial intervention and&#xD;
      informed consent process will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A.3- Data Collection Quality of Life, Coping and Well-being Method Participants 200&#xD;
      women with metastatic breast cancer will be recruited to the study from Oct 2021 until June&#xD;
      2023. Inclusion criteria: (a) above 18 years old (b) newly diagnosed with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer or during the last 6 months prior to commencement of the study. Ultra-Orthodox and&#xD;
      Arab patients will be part of the study groups, while the secular and national religious&#xD;
      patients will serve as control group. Each woman will define her own ethnic/religious&#xD;
      identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Patients will be initially approached by the study coordinator during their clinic&#xD;
      visit or during their visit to the oncology daycare. They will explained on the study and&#xD;
      provide inform consent, which will be storage separately from the study's questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have consented will complete a baseline demographics questionnaire (Appendix 3)&#xD;
      and all baseline and ongoing clinical data pertaining to their breast cancer diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment will be collected. Patients will complete psycho-social questionnaires every three&#xD;
      months. This will be coordinate by study's coordinator. The questionnaires will be completed&#xD;
      using the Qualtrics questionnaire design tool using their personal mobile phone or study's&#xD;
      tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every three months the research coordinator will contact the participant through phone and&#xD;
      will either send link to her phone or schedule a meeting in the hospital in which she will&#xD;
      answer the questionnaires or answer the questionnaires by phone according to patient's&#xD;
      preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the Questionnaires will be answered every three months (EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT-B, BDI,&#xD;
      FACIT-Sp, STAI) and some will be answered occasionally. The approximate time needed to answer&#xD;
      the questionnaire each time will be up to 30 minutes.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questionnaires will be completed every three months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life - The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to assess QoL in cancer patients. The&#xD;
      30-item questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional,&#xD;
      and social), a global quality of life scale, three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting), and several single-item symptom measures (dyspnea, loss of appetite, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Apart from two items of the&#xD;
      global quality of life scale scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 7&#xD;
      (excellent), all items were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very&#xD;
      much). Higher scores in functioning scales represent a higher level of functioning; higher&#xD;
      scores in symptom scales as well as single items, represent a greater level of impairment.&#xD;
      Cronbach's α for this instrument was 0.927. There are an official Hebrew and Arabic versions&#xD;
      of the questionnaire (Fayers, Bottomley, A. E. O. R. T. C &amp; EORTC Quality of Life Group,&#xD;
      2002) Well-being - Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) 37-item (Version&#xD;
      4) scale, which contains subscales of physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being&#xD;
      in addition to the 10-item breast-specific subscale. The FACT-B total score is the sum of&#xD;
      scores of all five subscales. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Negatively worded&#xD;
      items were recoded such that a higher score indicates as better. There are an official Hebrew&#xD;
      and Arabic versions of the questionnaire (Cella, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression - The Beck Depression Inventory BDI (Beck et al., 1996) is the most often used&#xD;
      self-rating instrument for depressive symptoms. A 21-item self-report depression screening&#xD;
      measure. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3, with higher&#xD;
      scores indicating higher levels of depression. The measures ask respondents to endorse&#xD;
      statements characterizing how they have been feeling throughout the past 2 weeks. The maximum&#xD;
      total score for all 21 items is 63. According to the BDI-II manual, scores of 0 to 13 denote&#xD;
      minimal depression, scores of 14 to 19 denote mild depression, scores of 20 to 28 denote&#xD;
      moderate depression, and scores of 29 to 63 denote severe depression. The questionnaire was&#xD;
      found numerous times valid and consistent. There are available Hebrew and Arabic versions of&#xD;
      the questionnaire Anxiety - The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a psychological&#xD;
      inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 40 questions on a self-report&#xD;
      basis. The STAI measures two types of anxiety: state anxiety - anxiety as a response to an&#xD;
      event, and trait anxiety - anxiety as a personal characteristic. For the current study we&#xD;
      will use only the state subscale. Higher scores represent higher levels of anxiety. The scale&#xD;
      was found to have high reliability (Spielberger, 2010) Spiritual well-being - The FACIT-Sp&#xD;
      has three sub-domains of spiritual well-being, which help facilitate an in-depth exploration&#xD;
      of the components that constitute spiritual well-being (peace, meaning, and faith). The&#xD;
      responses emphasized a sense of meaning in life, harmony, peacefulness, and a sense of&#xD;
      strength and comfort from one's faith. It consists of 12 items on 5-point Likert-type scale&#xD;
      to measure patient-reported (Peterman, Fitchett, Brady, Hernandez &amp; Cella, 2002). There are&#xD;
      an official Hebrew and Arabic versions of the questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and predisposition variables will be measured at Time 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic questionnaire was developed for the study and consist of questions regarding&#xD;
      socio-demographic variables. It need to be translate into Arabic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Religiosity - The Systems of Belief Inventory (SBI-15R) was designed to measure religious and&#xD;
      spiritual beliefs and practices, and the social support derived from a community sharing&#xD;
      those beliefs. The 15-item self-report measure is a revised and shortened form with two&#xD;
      dimensions: one with 10 items relating to beliefs and practices, and the second with five&#xD;
      items relating to the social support of the religious community. Each item is scored on a&#xD;
      four-point scale, ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree'. The score for the&#xD;
      total SBI-15 ranges from 0 to 45, with higher numbers indicating more religiosity. Cronbach's&#xD;
      alpha is 0.80. (Holland, Kash, Passik, Gronert, Sison &amp; Fox, 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attachment orientations - participants will complete a shortened version of the Experience in&#xD;
      Close Relationships [ECR] Scale. This 12-item version [ECR-12] ( Wei, 2007) 7 Likert - scale&#xD;
      is based on a previous Hebrew version of the questionnaire and was previously found to be&#xD;
      highly reliable. ECR-12 evaluates participants' attachment insecurities through two&#xD;
      dimensions: anxiety (e.g. &quot; I need a lot of reassurance that I am loved by people close to&#xD;
      me&quot;) and avoidance (e.g. &quot;I do not feel comfortable opening to other people&quot;) which construct&#xD;
      two subscales. A high score on each of the subscales indicates an attachment that is either&#xD;
      more anxious or avoidable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relational variables will be measured at Time 2. Some of the questionnaire will be answered&#xD;
      only by participants that have a spouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loneliness - The revised UCLA loneliness scale is the most widely used instrument to&#xD;
      empirically measure the level of loneliness. The UCLA loneliness scale consists 20-item&#xD;
      questionnaire that measures loneliness in adults. Each item is rated on a four-point&#xD;
      Likert-type scale. Positively worded items are reversed before scoring. Higher scores suggest&#xD;
      higher perceived loneliness (Russell, Peplau &amp; Cutrona, 1980). Hebrew version is available,&#xD;
      but the questionnaire still need to be translated into Arabic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived social support. The Cancer Perceived Agents of Social Support scale [CPASS;&#xD;
      Goldzweig, Hasson-Ohayon, Meirovitz, Braun, Hubert, &amp; Baider, 2010] was 23 originally&#xD;
      developed for Hebrew-speaking participants and consists of 12 items that assess the degree to&#xD;
      which a person perceives receiving support from four agents of support: spouse, family,&#xD;
      friends, and spiritual community. Three types of support given by each agent of support are&#xD;
      assessed, i.e., emotional support, cognitive support, and instrumental support. Answers are&#xD;
      given on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived support.&#xD;
      The CPASS has been shown to have adequate validity and reliability [Goldzweig et al., 2010].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires only for participants that have a spouse:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contextual self-concealment. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy [CISC; Wertheim,&#xD;
      Hasson-Ohayon, Mashiach-Eizenberg, Pizem, Shacham-Shmueli, &amp; Goldzweig, 2016] consists of 13&#xD;
      items, assessing the frequency of self-concealment behavior in the context of couples coping&#xD;
      with a chronic illness. Its wording emphasizes the individual's efforts spent in actively&#xD;
      trying to conceal different matters related to the illness (e.g., medical information,&#xD;
      physical symptoms, feelings, and implications of the illness), using various methods (e.g.,&#xD;
      camouflaging illness symptoms, keeping secrets, etc.). Responses are coded on a 7-point&#xD;
      scale, ranging from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater frequency of contextual&#xD;
      self-concealment. The CISC scale has shown acceptable psychometric qualities [Wertheim et&#xD;
      al., 2016]. Hebrew version is available, but the questionnaire still need to be translated&#xD;
      into Arabic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional disclosure and holding back of cancer-related concerns [Porter et al., 2005]. This&#xD;
      measure is a modified version of a measure developed by Pistrang and Barker [1995], which was&#xD;
      previously used among cancer patients and their spouses [Porter et al., 2005]. It assesses&#xD;
      the degree to which cancer patients and spouses talk to their partners about cancer related&#xD;
      feelings and concerns (e.g., &quot;How much did you talk to your spouse/partner about this&#xD;
      concern?&quot;). It also assesses the extent to which they hold back from doing so (e.g., &quot;How&#xD;
      much did you hold back from talking to your spouse/partner about this concern?&quot;). The&#xD;
      questionnaire consists of 10 items, addressing cancer-related concerns (e.g. patient's&#xD;
      physical symptoms; cancer treatment; patient's sexual functioning). For each item,&#xD;
      respondents will be asked to refer to the past week and rate: a) their level of disclosure,&#xD;
      on a 6-point scale and b) their level of holding back, on a 6-point scale. A higher score on&#xD;
      the disclosure/holding back subscales indicated a greater level of disclosure/holding back,&#xD;
      respectively. This measure has previously demonstrated adequate reliability for both&#xD;
      subscales [Porter et al., 2005]. Hebrew version is available, but the questionnaire still&#xD;
      need to be translated into Arabic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS) - The RAS is a short 7-item self-report inventory&#xD;
      designed to measure relationship satisfaction. This scale items are rated on a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale (e.g., &quot;In general, how satisfied are you with your relationship?&quot; and &quot;To what extent&#xD;
      has your relationship met your original expectations?&quot;). The RAS is unidimensional and has&#xD;
      demonstrated good internal co nsistency. Higher scores represented greater relationship&#xD;
      satisfaction. There are available Hebrew and Arabic versions of the questionnaire (Hendrick,&#xD;
      1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coping Variables will be measured at Time 3 Information - EORTC Information questionnaire -&#xD;
      QLQ -INFO25 QLQ-INFO25 is a 25-item module contains four multi-item scales (information about&#xD;
      the disease, medical tests, treatments, and other services) and eight single items (e.g.,&#xD;
      places of care, self-help to get well, information channels, and information satisfaction and&#xD;
      usefulness). QLQ-INFO25 also includes two open questions allowing patients to write about&#xD;
      topics of their choice. The response format consisted of a four-point Likert scale (1 - not&#xD;
      at all, 2- a little, 3 - quite a bit, 4 - very much), except for the dichotomous (yes/no)&#xD;
      questions 51 and 52 and 54 and 55. The questionnaire found to be reliable and valid&#xD;
      self-reported instrument. It is used in cross-cultural observational and intervention&#xD;
      studies. (Arraras et al., 2010). The questionnaire still needs to be translated into Hebrew&#xD;
      and Arabic. The questionnaire will be translated for the current study in forward-backward&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Illness Perception - Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Broadbentet al., 2006) consists&#xD;
      of nine items, appraising cognitive illness representations, emotional representations and&#xD;
      illness comprehensibility. Eight items are rated on Likert scale from 0 to 10. The last item&#xD;
      is a causal open-response item, which asks patients to list the three main causal factors in&#xD;
      their illness. Responses to the causal item can be grouped into different categories allowing&#xD;
      a subsequent categorical analysis. The total score is generated by summing up the scores for&#xD;
      the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire items with a reverse scoring of items 3, 4 and 7.&#xD;
      A higher total score reflects a more threatening perception of illness (Figueiras, Marcelino,&#xD;
      Claudino, Cortes, Maroco &amp; Weinman, 2010). There are available Hebrew and Arabic versions of&#xD;
      the questionnaire Adjustment to Cancer - The Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) Scale is a&#xD;
      40-item self-rating scale on Likert scale of 4 (Watson and Homewood, 2008). The scale&#xD;
      consists of five subscales: fighting spirit, anxious preoccupation, fatalism, helplessness:&#xD;
      hopelessness and avoidance. Previous studies have suggested that the MAC scale has adequate&#xD;
      validity and reliability (Akechi, Fukue-Saeki, Kugaya, Okamura, Nishiwaki, Yamawaki &amp;&#xD;
      Uchitomi, 2000). There are an official Hebrew and Arabic versions of the questionnaire&#xD;
      Additional questionnaires will be delivered at Time 4 Self-Compassion- Self-Compassion Scale&#xD;
      (SCS) is 25 items and six subscales: Self-Kindness; Self-Judgement; Common Humanity;&#xD;
      Isolation; Mindfulness; Over-Identification (Neff, 2003). Respondents were instructed with&#xD;
      the sentence &quot;how I typically act towards myself in difficult times&quot; and are asked to answer&#xD;
      each item according to a 5-point scale. Subscale scores are computed by calculating the mean&#xD;
      of subscale item responses. Higher scores indicate greater self-compassion. In the original&#xD;
      version, the total score showed an excellent internal consistency. There are available Hebrew&#xD;
      and Arabic versions of the questionnaire&#xD;
