      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human-computer interactions or 'Chatbots' have been utilized in a variety of healthcare&#xD;
      settings, including the promotion of positive healthcare behaviors, the deliverance of&#xD;
      psychological therapy, and the performance of diagnostic tasks. The growth of the internet&#xD;
      has enabled greater access to information regarding healthcare interventions, the truth and&#xD;
      value of which cannot always be verified. The use of Chatbots - online programs which attempt&#xD;
      to replicate person to person interactions - in providing healthcare information has been&#xD;
      successfully employed by prior studies. Recent studies have investigated the role of chatbots&#xD;
      in providing information in the post-operative period, across orthopaedic surgery, vascular&#xD;
      surgery and urology. The value of such human-computer interactions in providing&#xD;
      pre-procedural information is less well explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard methods of consenting patients for procedures may not always result in patients&#xD;
      being fully informed; a 2004 study of patients undergoing screening sigmoidoscopy&#xD;
      demonstrated that 39% of surveyed patients could describe no other indication than doctor&#xD;
      recommendation for the procedure after undergoing standard consent. Only 19% of patients&#xD;
      mentioned bleeding and perforation as possible complications. This study seeks to investigate&#xD;
      the usability of a novel chatbot designed to provide peri-procedural information in two&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures - diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) and diagnostic&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel Chatbot - 'SurgInfoBot' has been developed in order to provide real-time,&#xD;
      patient-driven peri-procedural information. This study primarily seeks to assess the effect&#xD;
      of SurgInfoBot use on patient satisfaction with the consent process in endoscopy. It will&#xD;
      also assess the usability of the chatbot according to the system usability scale and test&#xD;
      performance according to the as-yet unvalidated Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUX). User&#xD;
      engagement will be analyzed objectively using stored metrics. Comparison will be made between&#xD;
      perceptions of the SurgInfoBot as an information source and other established patient&#xD;
      information sources. The potential impact of the SurgInfoBot on peri-procedural anxiety will&#xD;
      also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised controlled trial will be reported according to the CONsolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 guidelines. A single blinded parallel study with 1:1&#xD;
      randomisation will be performed. This study will be conducted at Tallaght University Hospital&#xD;
      (Dublin, Ireland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing diagnostic or screening colonoscopy or Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy&#xD;
      (OGD) will be eligible for inclusion, provided they are aged 18 or over and have capacity to&#xD;
      consent to participate in this trial. Patients undergoing sigmoidoscopy procedures will not&#xD;
      be included, as the SurgInfoBot does not contain specific information regarding&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy. Patients undergoing planned procedures beyond those required for diagnostics&#xD;
      (such as biopsy, campylobacter-like organism testing or polyp retrieval) will not be eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion; this includes patients undergoing endoscopic stenting, endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      resection (EMR), planned endoscopic laser ablation, or other interventional procedures.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing emergency or inpatient endoscopy will not be eligible for inclusion. This&#xD;
      trial did not exclude patients who did not speak English as their first language, though&#xD;
      patients requiring an interpreter will not be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recruited from an academic teaching hospital in West Dublin. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be attending outpatient appointments with a single colorectal and general surgeon (DO&#xD;
      K). All endoscopy procedures will be performed in the same recruiting institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to receive either standard consent, or standard consent with&#xD;
      SurgInfoBot access. The standard consent procedure is as follows: The rationale, risks,&#xD;
      benefits, and alternatives for the intended procedure (diagnostic or screening OGD or&#xD;
      colonoscopy) are discussed in the outpatient clinic by a consultant general surgeon (DOK) or&#xD;
      members of the surgical team. Patients are given the opportunity to ask questions. All&#xD;
      patients receive a written information leaflet, which includes contact details for the&#xD;
      endoscopy department should patients wish to ask further questions. Those undergoing&#xD;
      colonoscopy receive further instructions along with prescribed colonoscopy 'prep' medication&#xD;
      by post. On the day of the procedure, patients are required to sign a standardised consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the SurgInfoBot arm will be consented as above, but will also granted access to&#xD;
      the SurgInfoBot, which they will be invited to use between their outpatient appointment and&#xD;
      their endoscopy procedure date. Participants will be provided with an access link and Unique&#xD;
      Study Identifier in order to pseudonymise participant data. Participants can access the&#xD;
      SurgInfoBot as many times as they wish, and could ask any questions they see fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'SurgInfoBot' is a fully automated conversational agent, built as a web page that can be&#xD;
      accessed via computer or smartphone. The SurgInfoBot was developed within the department of&#xD;
      Surgical Affairs, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, using the Microsoft Chatbot Framework&#xD;
      (Microsoft Corporation, 2019) and hosted by the Azure cloud system (Microsoft corporation,&#xD;
      2019). It is a command-based chatbot which relies on a database of questions and replies to&#xD;
      answer user queries. A question bank with associated answers was developed initially by two&#xD;
      general surgery residents (BM, CT) using national freely-available online resources where&#xD;
      available, and high quality peer-reviewed articles where no national resources addressed the&#xD;
      topic of concern. Content was verified for accuracy by a consultant colorectal/ general&#xD;
      surgeon (DO K). An iterative process of content generation, usability testing, modification&#xD;
      and re-testing was undertaken with healthy volunteers, in order to populate the SurgInfoBot's&#xD;
      knowledge database and ensure adequate usability prior to patient use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be performed using an online randomisation system&#xD;
      (https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists) . After undergoing standard&#xD;
      endoscopy consenting procedures as above, patients will be asked to consent to take part in&#xD;
      this research study. Recruited patients will then be allocated the next available unique&#xD;
      study identifier, randomly allocating patients to receive standard further consent&#xD;
      information (printed information leaflet) or access to the SurgInfoBot (printed information&#xD;
      leaflet and access instructions for the SurgInfoBot online interface). Both groups of&#xD;
      patients will also receive a link (via e-mail) to the survey of baseline demographics which&#xD;
      will completed before access to the SurgInfoBot is granted. Patients in the SurgInfoBot&#xD;
      access arm will also receive an e-mail with their access details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographic information will be recorded. This includes participant gender, age,&#xD;
      first language (English or other), level of educational attainment and electronic health&#xD;
      literacy as measured using the eHEALS (eHealth Literacy Scale) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure and Determination of Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction with the pre-procedural information received will be recorded using a&#xD;
      6-point Likert scale from '- - -' to '+ + +' using the following statement: &quot;Overall, I am&#xD;
      satisfied with the information I received before this procedure. This study was powered to&#xD;
      detect a 0.5 point increase in satisfaction, based on a mean and standard deviation derived&#xD;
      from a previous study utilising this scale by Huber et al. 201213, with a power of 80% and&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05. Thirty-one participants were therefore required for recruitment in each group.&#xD;
      Based on an anticipated drop-out rate of 20%, we aimed to recruit 70 patients in total (35 in&#xD;
      each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge was assessed using a 5 item questionnaire using both open and multiple choice&#xD;
      questions; participants were asked to identify the procedure they were having performed name&#xD;
      the indication for having this procedure performed, identify the nature of sedation given,&#xD;
      identify the risks of the procedure, and identify the alternatives of having the procedure&#xD;
      performed. Items and responses were reviewed by a general surgery resident (CT) and&#xD;
      colorectal/ general surgeon (DOK) for content validity. Knowledge questionnaires were&#xD;
      administered immediately after standard consent was provided, and on the day of the&#xD;
      procedure. Perceived knowledge was also assessed using a six-point Likert scale, based on&#xD;
      participant responses to the statement: &quot;I feel well informed about the planned procedure&quot;&#xD;
      from '- - -' to '+ + +'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety Peri-procedural anxiety was recorded on the day of the procedure using the&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults14&#xD;
&#xD;
      SurgInfoBot usability&#xD;
&#xD;
      SurgInfoBot usability was recorded using the validated ChatBot Usability Questionnaire&#xD;
      developed by Holmes et al. (2019)15, a usability scale specifically designed for evaluating&#xD;
      chatbots in healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data will be presented as both absolute and relative frequencies, continuous data&#xD;
      by mean and standard deviation. Comparisons between groups will be made using the Chi-Square&#xD;
      test and t-tests. An effect size will be calculated for the primary outcome measure (Overall&#xD;
      Satisfaction scores) - 95% confidence intervals will also be reported. Multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression will be used to identify predictors of complete satisfaction (defined as an&#xD;
      overall satisfaction score of +++). All tests will be two-tailed, with p&lt;0.05 considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. All analyses will be performed with SPSS software (IBM, USA).&#xD;
