  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that whole-body vibration (TVV) has beneficial neuromuscular effects such as&#xD;
      muscle strength increase. These beneficial effects are explained by the muscular reflex&#xD;
      response induced by TVV. Reflex latency measurement is frequently used in clinical and&#xD;
      neurophysiological research. The latency of the reflex response induced by TVV is defined as&#xD;
      the period between the onset of the vibration stimulus and the onset point of the spike in&#xD;
      the EMG signal. Various methods have been reported to determine the threshold stimulus&#xD;
      intensity at which the vibration stimulus activates the reflex response. In their study,&#xD;
      Ritzman et al. accepted the lower point of the vibration platform as the threshold at which&#xD;
      vibrational stimuli activate the reflex. In some studies, the threshold vibration stimulus&#xD;
      intensity that activates the reflex response was determined by measuring the vibration&#xD;
      platform thrust force, and in some studies, the vibration platform acceleration was measured.&#xD;
      However, there is no scientific information about the reliability of these methods used to&#xD;
      determine the vibration stimulus threshold. The aim of this research is to test the&#xD;
      reliability of the methods based on the measurement of vibration platform position, thrust&#xD;
      force, and acceleration used to determine the vibration stimulus threshold.&#xD;

      This is an experimental study for method development; a self-controlled (single group) study.&#xD;
      Ten healthy male or female subjects between the ages of 18-45 will be included in the study.&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent from the subjects, 30 Hz low amplitude (2 mm) vibration for&#xD;
      30 seconds will be applied on the PowerPlate Pro5 device to meet TVV. After three minutes of&#xD;
      rest, two sets of TVV will be applied for test purposes. For the test TVV, vibration will be&#xD;
      applied at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 Hz frequencies, each lasting 30 seconds, with low&#xD;
      amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration stimuli detected by using the position sensor, accelerometer, and force sensor&#xD;
      fixed on the TVV platform will be recorded the Data acquisition (PowerLab data acquisition&#xD;
      system (ADInstruments, Oxford, United Kingdom). Soleus EMG responses will be recorded using&#xD;
      the superficial electrodes (Kendall Covidien). The sample rate for recordings will be 40KHz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latency calculation with Cumulative Average Method: It will be done separately for all three&#xD;
      sensors. An 80-500 Hz band-pass filter and full-wave rectification will be applied to EMG&#xD;
      recordings. The peak of reflex responses (spike) will be marked with the help of LabChart7&#xD;
      (ver 7.3.7, ADInstruments, Oxford, United Kingdom). According to this marked point, 75 ms&#xD;
      back averaging process will be applied for each vibration frequency separately. With the back&#xD;
      averaging process, separate sensor records and EMG records will be averaged. Then, the&#xD;
      average of the five vibration frequencies will be calculated for the sensor recordings and&#xD;
      EMG recordings. The point where the standard error is lowest in the sensor recordings will be&#xD;
      determined as the &quot;effective stimulation point&quot;, and the point where the standard error is&#xD;
      the lowest in the EMG recordings will be determined as the &quot;reflex response onset time&quot;. The&#xD;
      difference between the effective stimulation points and the EMG starting point will be&#xD;
      calculated as the &quot;latency of the reflex response&quot;.&#xD;
