  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second most common blindness disease in the world, second only to cataracts.&#xD;
      The current treatment of glaucoma is mainly to reduce intraocular pressure.At present, two&#xD;
      commonly used surgical methods are trabeculectomy and implantation of drainage valve. These&#xD;
      methods are superior to drug treatment in reducing intraocular pressure, but the effect&#xD;
      duration of these two methods is not long, and there may be serious complications and&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with traditional glaucoma surgery, MIGS may have better safety.The XEN45 gel implant&#xD;
      is a collagen tube with a length of 6 mm and a diameter of 45 µm, which creates a new channel&#xD;
      for drainage of aqueous humor by connecting the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival&#xD;
      space. The implant is composed of porcine gelatin cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, and has&#xD;
      good biocompatibility and tolerance. Therefore, after the advent of XEN45 products, more and&#xD;
      more studies have shown that this treatment has excellent safety and effectiveness in&#xD;
      reducing intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that the XEN45 gel stent has been in the market for a relatively short time, we&#xD;
      conducted this prospective study to investigate the effect of XEN45 surgery in the treatment&#xD;
      of primary open-angle glaucoma, in order to support ophthalmologists in formulating the best&#xD;
      surgical plan for patients. The promotion of this surgical method.&#xD;
