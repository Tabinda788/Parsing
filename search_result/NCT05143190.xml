      A sub-set of patients who participated in PTR-01-002 will be enrolled in an open-label study,&#xD;

      Protocol PTR-01-003 is a 4-part Phase 2, open-label study of PTR-01 in patients who&#xD;
      satisfactorily completed study PTR-01-002 and meet current enrollment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, patients will be monitored monthly for up to 2 months with patient-reported and&#xD;
      Investigator assessments. In Part 2, patients will receive a dose of 3.0 mg/kg every week for&#xD;
      a total of 4 doses. This will be followed by Part 3 in which patients will receive a dose of&#xD;
      3.0 mg/kg monthly for a total of 5 additional doses. At the end of each dosing period,&#xD;
      efficacy assessments will be performed. During Part 4, patients will be evaluated at Months 1&#xD;
      and 3 after completion of dosing to assess the durability of wound healing and other efficacy&#xD;
      parameters. Safety will be assessed continuously throughout the study.&#xD;
