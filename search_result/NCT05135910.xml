    <textblock>
      The key objective is to establish the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      investigational drug Hallux Terbinafine Subungual Gel (HSG) administered over 44 weeks to&#xD;
      patients with distal-lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO).&#xD;

      Primary Efficacy: To identify patients achieving Complete Cure in the target toenail at Week&#xD;
      52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy: To identify patients that have achieved 1) Clinical Cure, 2) Mycological&#xD;
      Cure, and/or 3) Positive Response in the target toenail at Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma Pharmacokinetics: To characterize concentrations of terbinafine and major metabolite&#xD;
      in a subpopulation of patients over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nail Pharmacokinetics: To characterize concentrations of terbinafine and major metabolite in&#xD;
      distal nail clippings in patients over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSG Safety and Tolerability Profile: To establish from plasma pharmacokinetics, related&#xD;
      adverse events, treatment site reactions, pain, clinically significant changes in medical&#xD;
      condition and/or medications, and clinically significant changes in liver function, serum&#xD;
      chemistry, urinalysis, and complete blood count over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subungual Topical Procedure: To establish the ease and durability of once monthly and once&#xD;
      bi-monthly HSG subungual topical treatments, the Investigator will record at selected time&#xD;
      points 1) nail measurements indicating progressive clearing, 2) the ease and depth of each&#xD;
      topical administration, 3) the investigational drug volume administered each treatment, and&#xD;
      4) patient tolerability.&#xD;

    <description>Complete Cure is defined as 1) 100% healthy, clear nail, and 2) negative mycology. Healthy, clear nail is absent any disease involvement attributable to DLSO and is determined by Investigator Global Assessment (IGA). Negative mycology is defined as zero visualization of septate hyphae by KOH microscopy (negative KOH) combined with a fungal culture negative for causal dermatophytes (negative fungal culture).</description>

    <description>To evaluate the ease and durability of once monthly and once bi-monthly HSG subungual topical treatments to the target toe over 44 weeks. Nail measurements indicating progressive clearing are recorded from an Investigator Global Assessment scale referencing % disease involvement corroborated by nail image analysis. The ease and durability of subungual topical treatment is established using a 5-point Likert Scale. Patient local tolerability is established using a Treatment Site Assessment Scale and Pain Intensity Scale.</description>
