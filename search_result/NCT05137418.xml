      This study is a single-center, open-labelled, bridging phase Ⅲ clinical trial of COVID-19&#xD;
      Vaccine.The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the superiority of the COVID-19 Vaccine&#xD;
      in healthy population aged from 3 to 11 years against that in adults aged 18-26 years.This&#xD;
      study (PRO-nCOV-3002-1) will be used as a sub-trial of the Phase Ⅲ global multi-center&#xD;
      clinical trial in children and adolescents(PRO-nCOV-3002) to provide safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity data.A total of 1000 healthy children aged 3-11 years will be enrolled&#xD;
      ,including 500 children aged 3-5 years and 500 children aged 6-11 years.All subjects will&#xD;
      receive 2 doses of experimental vaccine (600SU) with an interval of 28 days,and adverse&#xD;
      reactions/events will be collected from all subjects after each dose and SAE and AESI&#xD;
      monitoring will be completed from the beginning of vaccination to 6 and 12 months after full&#xD;
      vaccination to evaluate the safety of the vaccine.About 3.0-3.5ml of venous blood will be&#xD;
      collected from all subjects before immunization, 28 days after the whole immunization, 6&#xD;
      months after the whole immunization and 12 months after the whole immunization. Neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody and S antibody will be detected to evaluate the immunogenicity and immune&#xD;
      persistence of the vaccine.&#xD;
