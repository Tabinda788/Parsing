  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effects of a mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention delivered to justice-involved youth on probation via smartphone app on youths'&#xD;
      emotion regulation and HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk-taking behaviors (i.e.,&#xD;
      alcohol use, cannabis use, sexual behaviors, and aggressive behaviors).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 200 justice-involved youth on probation 13-18 years old of all&#xD;
      genders who report regular access to an Apple or Android smartphone. Following completion of&#xD;
      a baseline questionnaire, participants will be individually randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 1 of&#xD;
      2 smartphone app conditions: (1) Bodhi AIM (Action In Mindfulness), a 30-day&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention, or (2) HIB (Health In Balance), a health promotion control&#xD;
      app matched to Bodhi AIM for time and structure. Follow-up assessments will occur at 1 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>Bodhi AIM (Action In Mindfulness) is a smartphone-based app that teaches users to establish a daily meditation practice via a 30-day &quot;path,&quot; with each day consisting of a brief audio- or video-guided file. In addition to the 30 daily path files, users have access to a menu of &quot;to go&quot; audio-guided meditation practices that they may access any time to prepare for particular situations (e.g., attending a party).</description>

    <description>HIB (Health In Balance) is a smartphone-based app that is matched to Bodhi AIM for time and structure, but includes health promotion content (e.g., educational information on substance use) in place of the meditation content featured in Bodhi AIM. Like Bodhi AIM, HIB includes a 30-day &quot;path&quot; of audio and video files, along with a menu of &quot;to go&quot; audio files that users may access any time to review key intervention concepts.</description>
