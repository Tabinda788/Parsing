    <textblock>
      The aim is to apply an exercise program to study symptomatic and physical changes, as well as&#xD;
      to evaluate the improvement in functionality in a resistant depression unit. Sample: 20&#xD;
      patients with the resistant major depressive disorder who will undergo an exercise program.&#xD;
      Before and after 12 weeks of intervention, the participants will be assessed with clinical,&#xD;
      physical, physiological, biochemical, and functional variables. During 3 months the exercise&#xD;
      program will be implemented 2 days per week. It is expected to find an improvement in mood&#xD;
      and functionality, as well as changes in physical areas such as blood pressure or body mass&#xD;
      index, which are considered predictive factors of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in today's society is worryingly high.&#xD;
      Specifically, the prevalence-year prevalence of MDD in Spain is 3.9% and lifetime prevalence&#xD;
      is 10.5%. The lifetime prevalence for men is 6.29% and 14.47% for women in Spain according to&#xD;
      the ESEMED-Spain study. Although there is no explicit international consensus, the medical&#xD;
      literature and research define treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as any MDD that does not&#xD;
      respond to two trials of treatment antidepressant treatment at adequate doses and for an&#xD;
      adequate duration of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDD is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, accounting for 11.9%. It&#xD;
      has been estimated that during the year 2020 it could be second only to ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease in disability-adjusted life years lost. Given this bleak scenario, different&#xD;
      non-pharmacological strategies have been considered as possible complementary treatments to&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment to help improve the prognosis of MDD and remission rates, such as&#xD;
      exercise and electroconvulsive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary lifestyles are a very common feature in the severely mentally disordered&#xD;
      population. One of the causes for this to occur is that people with MDD have very little&#xD;
      confidence in their ability to exercise and lack the necessary social support. This&#xD;
      inactivity together with other modifiable risk factors such as tobacco use, high blood&#xD;
      pressure, and overweight/obesity, in addition to the side effects of pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments contributes to the appearance of different diseases, as well as decreased life&#xD;
      expectancy and quality of life. TDM can act as a cause or as a repercussion of physical&#xD;
      inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been recognized for several years that the performance of regular exercise is&#xD;
      cardioprotective, decreasing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases such as arterial&#xD;
      hypertension, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. In addition to&#xD;
      being cardioprotective, exercise has shown a positive association with psychological&#xD;
      well-being and therapeutic benefits in older people with depressive disorder, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease and MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is still some controversy about the intensity and frequency of exercise, and&#xD;
      the duration of the exercise program, the recommendations were the adoption of a&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise program of at least 30 minutes on most days of the week, for&#xD;
      10-12 weeks. In the latest World Health Organization guidelines on physical activity (PA) and&#xD;
      sedentary habits, for the improvement of quality of life in adults with TMD the general&#xD;
      recommendations do not differ from the general population, i.e., people should accumulate&#xD;
      throughout the week a minimum of 150-300 minutes of moderate aerobic PA or a minimum of&#xD;
      75-150 minutes of vigorous PA, or an equivalent combination of both in order to obtain&#xD;
      notable health benefits. Also, in order to achieve additional health benefits, the&#xD;
      participants should perform two days a week of moderate or higher intensity&#xD;
      muscle-strengthening activities.&#xD;
