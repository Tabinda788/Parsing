  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the safety of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT)&#xD;
      in patients with localized pancreatic cancer undergoing surgical resection after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard of care treatment for patients with non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC)&#xD;
      includes chemotherapy and Stereotactic Body Radiation Treatment (SBRT) followed by surgical&#xD;
      resection of the tumor with or without Intra-Operative Radiation Therapy (IORT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence from other research studies suggesting that adding radiation treatment&#xD;
      during the surgical resection may improve local control of the cancer. The use of IORT plus&#xD;
      surgical resection can be used to treat pancreatic cancer and is done on a case by case basis&#xD;
      at Johns Hopkins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The department of Radiation Oncology has developed a program using a High Dose Rate-IORT&#xD;
      (HDR-IORT). The HDR-IORT makes it possible to deliver concentrated radiation dose at the&#xD;
      surface of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team has shown in previous studies that the majority of cancer cells that remain after&#xD;
      treatment are located around the area of the pancreas called the &quot;Triangle Volume&quot; (TV). This&#xD;
      region contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves, and is at high risk of&#xD;
      containing cancer cells. This region is difficult to treat with SBRT alone because of being&#xD;
      close to normal, healthy organs. Therefore, this study involves using IORT to treat the TV to&#xD;
      a therapeutic radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The part of the treatment that is considered research is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Giving one dose of 15 Gy during the surgery using IORT to deliver radiation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targeting the larger area around the pancreas called the TV&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine safety of this added treatment which will be assessed&#xD;
      at 3 months after the surgery is completed.&#xD;
