  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of a combined therapy of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise and transcranial photobiomodulation upon the cardinal motor sympomts of Parkinson´s&#xD;
      disease of a group of Parkinson´s disease patients. It was hypothesized that aerobic exercise&#xD;
      and transcranial photobiomodulation would yield significant benefits in the cardinal motor&#xD;
      sympomts of the illness.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients assigned to the IAER participated in fourty-eigth aerobic exercise therapy sessions over the course of six months. Two aerobic exercise sessions on a bicycle ergometer were held every week on non-consecutive days, which lasted 30-60 min (depending on the therapy´s stage)</description>

    <arm_group_label>Intervention photobiomodulation (IPBM)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients assigned to the IPBM participated in fourty-eigth transcraneal photobiomodulation (PBM) theraphy sessions, using a therapeutic laser console, over the course of six months. Two transcraneal PBM sessions were held every week on non-consecutive days, which lasted 8 min and 30 sec. PBM was administered in six 1-minute blocks alternating between the right and left temples, with a 30-second rest between blocks.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients assigned to the IAER+PBM participated in the aerobic exercise therapy and the PBM one at the same time. Thus, two aerobic exercise sessions and two transcranial PBM sessions were hold weekly on non-consecutive days during six months (fourty-eigth sessions) following the next sequence; aerobic exercise session, PBM session, aerobic exercise session and transcranial PBM session.</description>
