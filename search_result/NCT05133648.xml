    <textblock>
      Patients with COVID undergoing hip fracture repair have high mortality rates. If spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia is associated with decreased rates of mortality, this study could provide&#xD;
      hypothesis generating data for prospective studies. Investigators hypothesize that spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia (SA) is associated with decreased mortality compared to general anesthesia (GA)&#xD;
      for patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. The primary objective is to determine for&#xD;
      patients undergoing hip surgery with COVID-19 infection, whether SA, as compared to GA, is&#xD;
      associated with a lower rate of mortality 30 days postoperatively. The secondary objective is&#xD;
      to determine whether SA, as compared to GA, is associated with a lower rate of morbidity 30&#xD;
      days postoperatively. Investigators will be analyzing a data set provided by the National&#xD;
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Descriptive statistics will be performed.&#xD;
      Multivariable logistic regression will be performed for the primary and secondary objectives.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with hip fracture have poor outcomes, attributed to risk factors that&#xD;
      include advanced age and higher rates of underlying chronic comorbidities. COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      is an independent risk factor for increased mortality in hip fracture patients in the&#xD;
      perioperative period. A recent meta-analysis demonstrates COVID-19 infection is associated&#xD;
      with higher than seven-fold increase in risk of mortality. Recommended management of hip&#xD;
      fracture includes timely surgical repair, multimodal pain control, and multidisciplinary&#xD;
      follow-up, to facilitate return to mobility and independent function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia for hip fracture surgery can be achieved by either general anesthesia (GA) or&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia (SA). The potential advantages of SA include opioid-sparing effects,&#xD;
      lessened impacts on the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, and reduction in rates of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes such as pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      admission, venous thromboembolism (VTE), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, transfusion,&#xD;
      readmission, and prolonged postoperative length of stay. However, a recent randomized control&#xD;
      trial found no difference between SA and GA for older adults undergoing hip fracture surgery&#xD;
      for the primary outcome of survival and recovery of ambulation at 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While emerging evidence shows COVID-19 infection increases mortality after hip surgery, there&#xD;
      is a lack of research examining whether the choice of anesthetic technique modifies the&#xD;
      postoperative mortality and morbidity of hip fracture patients with COVID-19 infection. This&#xD;
      is particularly important due to the high mortality (35% in COVID-positive patients, vs. 2%&#xD;
      in patients without COVID), with the potential for SA to modify this risk by circumventing&#xD;
      the need for airway interventions. SA may also offer superiority over general anesthesia for&#xD;
      limiting aerosol generation and exposure of operating room staff during the pandemic. While&#xD;
      SA may reduce the risk of pulmonary morbidity by reducing the need for airway interventions,&#xD;
      its motor block on accessory muscles and the need for sedation may adversely impact&#xD;
      ventilation. Investigators hypothesize that spinal anesthesia (SA) is associated with&#xD;
      decreased mortality compared to general anesthesia (GA) for patients undergoing hip fracture&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The requirement for written informed consent will be waived for use of&#xD;
      deidentified data. Patient information will be obtained for the retrospective cohort analysis&#xD;
      using the NSQIP® (general dataset linked with the Hip Fracture Procedure Targeted Dataset), a&#xD;
      prospectively-collected multicentre dataset with more than 150 clinical variables within 30&#xD;
      days after surgery. The setting of this study will be patient data obtained from the&#xD;
      multicentre generated NSQIP Hip Fracture Procedure Targeted Dataset. The period of patient&#xD;
      data obtained will include from January 2017 through December 2020. Data will only be&#xD;
      obtained from patients undergoing hip surgery with mortality and morbidity gathered for 30&#xD;
      days postoperatively_In this study, the investigators goal is to evaluate the adjusted&#xD;
      association between anesthesia technique and mortality and morbidity after hip fracture&#xD;
      surgery for patients who tested positive for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine for patients undergoing hip surgery with COVID-19&#xD;
      infection, whether SA, as compared to GA, is associated with a lower rate of mortality 30&#xD;
      days postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine whether SA, as compared to GA, is associated with a&#xD;
      lower rate of morbidity 30 days postoperatively. To provide context for interpretation,&#xD;
      investigators will describe the epidemiology of the following rates during versus before the&#xD;
      2020 COVID-19 pandemic (May to December 2020, compared to 2017 to 2019): 1) SA versus GA&#xD;
      utilization for hip fracture surgery, and 2) mortality and morbidity for hip surgery patients&#xD;
      without COVID-19 infection. Finally, Investigators will quantify the mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      for patients with versus without COVID-19 infection undergoing hip fracture surgery,&#xD;
      stratified by SA and GA. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adjusted&#xD;
      association between anesthesia technique and mortality and morbidity after hip fracture&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population cohorts: The study will be divided into three cohorts: those undergoing hip&#xD;
      surgery 1) without COVID-19 infection May to December 2020, 2) with COVID-19 infection May to&#xD;
      December 2020, and 3) pre-pandemic from January 2017 to December 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the variable duration of asymptomatic period that can precede symptoms and diagnosis,&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection status will be classified as follows. In the primary analysis,&#xD;
      COVID-negative patients will be defined as no preoperative COVID (within 14 days before&#xD;
      surgery) and no postoperative COVID, and COVID-positive patients will be defined as yes&#xD;
      (lab-confirmed) preoperative COVID and no postoperative COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In NSQIP, preoperative COVID status denotes within 14 days before surgery, and patients with&#xD;
      preoperative COVID are always coded &quot;No&quot; for postoperative COVID. NSQIP does not have&#xD;
      previous history of COVID prior to 14 days, which is a major limitation given the increased&#xD;
      mortality of patients with recent COVID undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As patients with postoperative COVID-positive status are difficult to interpret due to&#xD;
      variable incubation period and the possibility of COVID-19 contraction while in hospital&#xD;
      postoperatively, investigators will perform sensitivity analysis using alternative&#xD;
      definitions for the COVID-positive cohort, including 1) laboratory confirmed preoperatively&#xD;
      or postoperatively, 2) laboratory confirmed or symptomatic preoperatively, and 3) suspected&#xD;
      and laboratory confirmed anytime preoperatively or postoperatively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Investigators will be analyzing a data set provided by the National Surgical&#xD;
      Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Descriptive statistics will be performed. Multivariable&#xD;
      logistic regression will be performed for the primary and secondary objectives.&#xD;
