  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      likely effectiveness of an evidence-based guided self-help intervention for binge eating and&#xD;
      related disordered over-eating in those unable to access clinician provided treatments. If&#xD;
      feasible, acceptable and likely to be effective, such interventions could be made available&#xD;
      more widely as an early intervention to those in need. Such interventions have the potential&#xD;
      to improve quality of life by removing or ameliorating symptoms that impair psychological and&#xD;
      social functioning. Eligible participants will receive the guided self-help intervention - an&#xD;
      evidence-based self help program in the form of a self-help book plus telephone support and&#xD;
      encouragement to follow the program provided by specially trained help-line volunteers.&#xD;
      Support completing the self-help program will be provided over a period of 4 months and&#xD;
      participants will be followed up for a year after completion of the intervention.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete brief online assessments before starting the program,&#xD;
      at the end of 4 months when they complete the program and at 6 month and 12 month follow up.&#xD;
