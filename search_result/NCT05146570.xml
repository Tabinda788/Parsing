  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Device-associated meningitis is a severe complication after implantation of various central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) devices such as ventriculoperitoneal (VP) and ventriculoatrial (VA)&#xD;
      shunts, external ventricular drains (EVD), lumbar drains (ELD) and intrathecal pumps. In&#xD;
      contrast to native meningitis, these infections are hard to diagnose both clinically and on&#xD;
      the laboratory basis due to (i) atypical clinical manifestation, (ii) overlapping&#xD;
      inflammation following surgery, and (iii) common culture negativity due to previous&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy and slow growth of low-virulent pathogens. Also, device-associated&#xD;
      infections are difficult to differentiate from aseptic shunt failure (dysfunction) or&#xD;
      &quot;chemical meningitis&quot; caused by underlying neurosurgical condition that prompted the&#xD;
      placement of the CNS device (e.g. intracranial hemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both native and device-associated meningitis carry substantial morbidity and mortality. Rapid&#xD;
      and reliable diagnosis of meningitis is critical for initiating and choosing optimal&#xD;
      treatment and minimizing the brain damage. Since treatment is different in septic than&#xD;
      aseptic meningitis, it is paramount to diagnose or exclude septic meningitis as soon as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several new diagnostic methods, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) procalcitonin,&#xD;
      interleukin-6 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been proposed for rapid diagnosis of&#xD;
      meningitis. However, insufficient sensitivity and/or specificity, long time until test&#xD;
      result, and complexity in handling or interpretation of results limit their use in clinical&#xD;
      routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies CSF D-lactate test showed good specificity and sensitivity in patients&#xD;
      with native meningitis. This biomarker is pathogen-specific - in contrast to other currently&#xD;
      used host-specific biomarkers (leukocyte count, L-lactate, procalcitonin). However, no study&#xD;
      on effectiveness of D-lactate test for the diagnosis of device-associated meningitis has been&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful management of device-associated meningitis depends upon appropriate control of the&#xD;
      infectious complications. To deal with such complications, adequate assessment and prediction&#xD;
      of the clinical course are needed. Another use of D-lactate test could be his role as&#xD;
      prognostic factor of the clinical course of device-associated meningitis.&#xD;

      Study aim Evaluation of the analytical and clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive and negative predictive value, accuracy) of a novel, pathogen-specific biomarker&#xD;
      D-lactate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of&#xD;
      native and device-associated meningitis. The performance of CSF D-lactate will be compared&#xD;
      with currently used conventional CSF culture and biomarkers, using standard definition&#xD;
      criteria for infection (native and device-associated meningitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1. Determination of the performance of D-lactate test for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           device-associated meningitis and native meningitis in serially collected CSF samples&#xD;
           through lumbar/ventricular puncture (pre- or intra-operatively), external ventricular&#xD;
           drainage (EVD), lumbar drainage (ELD) and shunt aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2. Evaluate the optimal cut-off value of CSF D-lactate test for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           device-associated and native meningitis using the existing definition criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3. Evaluation of performance of D-lactate test for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           device-associated and native meningitis compared to standard tests (culture, gram stain,&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count &amp; differential, CSF lactate, CSF glucose,&#xD;
           CSF-to-blood glucose ratio, CSF total protein, multiplex PCR) and novel biomarkers (CSF&#xD;
           procalcitonin, alpha-defensin - ELISA, interleukin-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included will be consecutive patients with suspected device-associated meningitis and native&#xD;
      meningitis treated in our institution. CSF will be aspirated following the routine diagnostic&#xD;
      procedure. During conduction of this study no additional invasive or non-invasive&#xD;
      examinations will be performed. The results obtained in this clinical investigation will not&#xD;
      influence the diagnostic or treatment decisions for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study definitions Device-associated meningitis will be defined according to modified criteria&#xD;
      for nosocomial infections from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device-associated meningitis or ventriculitis must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Relevant growth of a pathogen in the CSF, on the device or in the wound swab of the&#xD;
           device insertion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At least one of the following signs or symptoms without another identifiable cause:&#xD;
           fever &gt;38°C, headache, neck stiffness, cranial nerve signs, irritability, decrease in&#xD;
           Glasgow coma scale (GCS) AND at least one of the following laboratory findings:&#xD;
           increased CSF leukocytes (&gt;5 × 10^6/l), increased CSF total protein (&gt;0.45 g/l) or&#xD;
           decreased CSF/blood glucose ratio (&lt;0.5); positive CSF gram stain AND the physician&#xD;
           initiates an antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following classification system for native meningitis will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meningitis is diagnosed, if at least 1 of the following criteria is present:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient has organisms cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient has at least 1 of the following signs or symptoms: fever (&gt;38°C), headache*,&#xD;
           stiff neck*, meningeal signs*, cranial nerve signs*, or irritability*&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. And at least 1 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. increased white cells, elevated protein, and decreased glucose in CSF&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. organisms seen on Gram's stain of CSF&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. organisms cultured from blood&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. positive laboratory test of CSF, blood, or urine&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. diagnostic single antibody titer (IgM) or 4-fold increase in paired sera (IgG) for&#xD;
                pathogen and if diagnosis is made antemortem, physician institutes appropriate&#xD;
                antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  With no other recognized cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with diagnosed native or device-associated meningitis, the onset of the infection&#xD;
      will be defined by clinical, laboratory and microbiology characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduction In device-associated meningitis, CSF will be aspirated before, during or&#xD;
      after surgery related to the device, according to the standard practice. Lumbar/ventricular&#xD;
      punctures (pre-, intra- and/or postoperatively) and external ventricular (EVD) and lumbar&#xD;
      drainage (ELD) aspiration will be performed by neurologist or neurosurgeon according to&#xD;
      standardized aseptic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with native meningitis, CSF will be aspirated by lumbar puncture, according the&#xD;
      standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately after aspiration, 0.5-1 ml of cerebrospinal fluid will be transferred into&#xD;
           each of the following vials:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  native vial for conventional culture (agar plate &amp; broth)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EDTA vial for the determination of leukocyte count and differential&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pediatric blood culture bottle (BacTec PedsPlus/F)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  native vial for biomarker detection (e.g. D-Lactate, procalcitonin interleukin-6,&#xD;
                alpha-defensin (ELISA) and additional tests (e.g. PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The D-lactate test will be performed using spectrophotometric enzyme assay according to&#xD;
           the manufacturer's instructions (D-Lactate Colorimetric Assay. Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,&#xD;
           Missouri, USA) as follows: the reaction mixture containing 10 µl of cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
           samples, 2 µl of substrate mix and 2 µl of enzyme mix and blank containing only the&#xD;
           sample and substrate mix will be analyzed for each sample. A calibration curve with&#xD;
           solutions of D-lactate (monolithium salt) in water will be processed in each batch. The&#xD;
           mixture will be incubated at room temperature for 30 min and absorbance at 450 nm&#xD;
           determined by Microplate Absorbance Reader. The optical density of each sample will be&#xD;
           recalculated into D-lactate concentration in mmol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test will be performed by two trained medical laboratory technical assistants, who&#xD;
           are available during 12 hours on working days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All CSF aspirates and growing microorganisms (including those growing from&#xD;
           intraoperative samples, such as peri-implant tissue or sonication fluid) will be stored&#xD;
           in a biobank at -70°C. This fluid and culture collection allows subsequent additional&#xD;
           analysis to assure the correct diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For device-associated meningitis it is assumed that 30-40% of the CSF samples are infected&#xD;
      and the difference in sensitivity between D-lactate and conventional tests is 10% (90% for&#xD;
      D-lactate vs. 80% for conventional tests). For native meningitis it is assumed that 10% of&#xD;
      the CSF samples are infected and the difference in sensitivity between D-lactate and&#xD;
      conventional tests is 20% (95% for D-lactate vs. 75% for conventional tests). Proof of&#xD;
      non-inferiority between the two tests is provided by a one-sided two-group test of the&#xD;
      percentage values. The non-inferiority is determined at a difference of 10% and can be shown&#xD;
      for foreign material-associated meningitis in 458 patients and for native meningitis in 198&#xD;
      patients at a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%. The power calculation was&#xD;
      performed with nQuery Advisor 7.0. Depending on the scale-type of data, the descriptive&#xD;
      results are expressed as mean ± SD or number of subjects (percentage). Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be compared using x2 or Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate. Continuous variables will&#xD;
      be compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A p value &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. Test results will be evaluated with sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and statistical significance&#xD;
      will be assessed with McNemar's Chi-squared test or a binomial test depending on sample size.&#xD;
      All p-values from secondary analyses will be considered in a non-confirmatory exploratory&#xD;
      manner. For statistical analyses the program packages SPSS (SPSS 10.0 for Windows, SPSS, USA)&#xD;
      and the program package R (most recent version at time of analysis) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to include a total of 600 patients with device-associated meningitis and&#xD;
      220 patients with native meningitis. The high number of cases is indicated because&#xD;
      investigators only expect a 30-40% infection rate for the foreign device-associated&#xD;
      meningitis and a 10% infection rate for the native meningitis as well as a 10-15% drop-out&#xD;
      rate (e.g. lack of leukocyte count or culture).&#xD;
