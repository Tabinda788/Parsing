  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how well a new medicine called concizumab works for participants who&#xD;
      have haemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors. The purpose is to show that concizumab&#xD;
      can prevent bleeds and is safe to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have to inject the study medicine every day under the skin with a&#xD;
      pen-injector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 2 years.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to study intervention or related products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known inherited or acquired coagulation disorder other than congenital haemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or planned Immune Tolerance Induction treatment.&#xD;

          -  History of thromboembolic disease (aIncludes arterial and venous thrombosis including&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction/thrombosis, deep vein&#xD;
             thrombosis, other clinically significant thromboembolic events and peripheral artery&#xD;
             occlusion.). Current clinical signs of or treatment for thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
             Patients who in the judgement of the investigator are considered at high risk of&#xD;
             thromboembolic events (Thromboembolic risk factors could include, but are not limited&#xD;
             to, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, smoking, family&#xD;
             history of thromboembolic events, arteriosclerosis, other conditions associated with&#xD;
