  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor-sparing analgesic interventions for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA)&#xD;
      are a key component of fast-track surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to estimate treatments effects, inclusion rate, and feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a future randomized controlled superiority trial and to assess whether the&#xD;
      short-term postoperative analgesic effect and ambulation after a Genicular - Infiltration&#xD;
      Between Popliteal Artery and Capsule of Knee (iPACK) block in patients undergoing unilateral&#xD;
      primary TKA is superior to Femoral triangle - iPACK block and Local Infiltration Analgesia&#xD;
      (LIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, double-blind, triple-arm superiority pilot randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial with a randomization rate 1:1:1.Group I will receive a Genicular - iPACK block, group&#xD;
      II a Femoral Triangle - iPACK block and group III LIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome is the proportion of patients that are able to mobilise (defined as&#xD;
      walk 10 meters with assistance) with a numerical rating scale (NRS) of equal or less than 4&#xD;
      without the use of opioids at 4-6 hours after TKA. Secondary outcomes are efficacy (measured&#xD;
      in NRS, total morphine consumption, total morphine titrations), functionality (quadriceps&#xD;
      strength, timed-up-and-go, 6-minute walk test, inpatient falls), frequency of opioid related&#xD;
      adverse events, discharge readiness, patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      length of stay (LOS), complications after TKA and adverse events related to the study&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most frequently performed orthopedic surgical&#xD;
      procedures for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Fast-tract recovery protocols&#xD;
      emphasize the importance of early mobilization and physiotherapy to improve functional&#xD;
      recovery, reduce postoperative complications, and decrease the economic burden of TKA. As the&#xD;
      patients having TKA typically have severe pain postoperatively, multimodal analgesic regimen&#xD;
      in many institutions includes interventional analgesia modality, such as nerve blocks, to&#xD;
      facilitate early mobilization. At this time however, no universal recommendation exists on&#xD;
      what constitutes the optimal nerve block technique that provides favorable balance between&#xD;
      motor sparing for ambulation and analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various motor-sparing nerve blocks (e.g., femoral triangle block, adductor canal block,&#xD;
      obturator nerve blocks, Infiltration Between Popliteal Artery and Capsule of Knee (iPACK),&#xD;
      genicular nerve block and Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA)) are viable options for&#xD;
      interventional analgesia in patients undergoing TKA. By this study in patients having TKA,&#xD;
      the investigators aim to compare the analgesia and ambulation between the genicular nerve&#xD;
      block iPACK versus Femoral triangle nerve block + iPACK versus LIA.&#xD;

    <description>The main study outcome is the proportion of patients that have a numeral rating scale (NRS) &lt;4 during mobilization without morphine at 4-6 hours after TKA. Mobilisation will be defined as walking 10 meters with walking aids or an assistant. NRS is a unidimensional, subjective measurement of pain intensity, expressed by the patient as a number between 0 and 10. It is a 11 point scale in which 0 equals no pain and 10 maximal pain. NRS at rest will also be determined</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 1 month after TKA</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used self-administered health status measure used in assessing pain, stiffness, and function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
