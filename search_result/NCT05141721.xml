  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to characterize the clinical&#xD;
      activity of maintenance therapy with GRT-C901/GRT-R902 in combination with checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors in addition to fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab versus fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab&#xD;
      alone as assessed by changes in circulating tumor (ct)DNA. The primary objective of the Phase&#xD;
      3 portion is to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the regime as assessed by progression-free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumors harboring non-synonymous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations can present peptides&#xD;
      containing these mutations as non-self antigens in the context of human leukocyte antigens&#xD;
      (HLAs) on the tumor cell surface. A fraction of mutated peptides result in neoantigens&#xD;
      capable of generating T-cell responses that exclusively target tumor cells. Sensitive&#xD;
      detection of these mutations allows for the identification of neoantigens unique to each&#xD;
      patient's tumor to be included in a personalized cancer vaccine that targets these&#xD;
      neoantigens. This vaccine regimen uses two vaccine vectors as a heterologous prime/boost&#xD;
      approach (GRT-C901 first followed by GRT-R902) to stimulate an immune response. This study&#xD;
      will explore the anti-tumor activity of this patient-specific immunotherapy in combination&#xD;
      with checkpoint inhibitors in addition to fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab.&#xD;
