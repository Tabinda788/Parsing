      This is going to be a non-interventional study (NIS). Assessment of variables will be carried&#xD;
      out using data on patient's treatment in real-life clinical setting. Patients should be&#xD;
      enrolled into study after evaluation of eligibility criteria by the investigator. No&#xD;
      additional procedures besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be&#xD;
      applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done according to the current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of efficacy and safety of any approaches used for CLL/SLL treatment is not the&#xD;
      primary objective of this study, though there is no treatment of interest. Study procedures&#xD;
      will comply with all the local regulatory requirements regarding AE reporting&#xD;
      (pharmacovigilance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enroll approximately 2000 patients. It is planned to enroll approximately&#xD;
      2000 patients (suggested number of patients on WW~520 pts, 1L~780 pts, RR~700 pts)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of study's prospective part, it is planned to carry out at approximately 7&#xD;
      visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (if unscheduled visit performed - the information should be filled on nearest visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline visit: ICF signing, initial patient's data input will be done retrospectively,&#xD;
           for patients who are already monitored by investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interim Visits (CRF will be filled every 6 month, all patient's visits should be planned&#xD;
           according routine practice and investigator's judgement on individual basis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final visit (data collection on 36 months after enrollment): patient's data input will&#xD;
           be done for previously enrolled patients (data update).&#xD;
