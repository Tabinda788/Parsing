  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase IV, single arm study will be performed in postmenopausal women with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic breast cancer. All patients included will receive fulvestrant from Dr. Reddy's&#xD;
      Laboratories, in accordance with local practice and the regulatory authorization of the drug&#xD;
      in Colombia. This study will be carried out for 1 year and approximately 40 patients will be&#xD;
      included in 2 research centers selected for its conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and who do not have to be discarded from entering&#xD;
      the study due to meeting any of the exclusion criteria, will be evaluated to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerability of the administration of Dr. Reddy's fulvestrant at a dose of&#xD;
      500 mg / month plus an additional indicated dose 14 days after the initial dose, for 12&#xD;
      months of follow-up or until disease progression or the appearance of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      The assessment of tolerability will be carried out based on the collection of data related to&#xD;
      adverse events from the first dose administered.&#xD;
