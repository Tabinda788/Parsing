  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD develops after trauma and is marked by intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders,&#xD;
      negative changes in mood and cognitive processes, and dysregulated physical and emotional&#xD;
      stress reactivity. PTSD disparately affects twice as many women as men (8.0% vs. 4.1%), and&#xD;
      finding effective treatments for these women is critical to reduce poor health outcomes&#xD;
      associated with PTSD. Mind-body therapies (MBT), using the mind in combination with the body&#xD;
      to facilitate healing hold promise to enhance PTSD treatment by improving stress regulation.&#xD;
      While MBT reduce PTSD symptoms long-term, women with PTSD may initially experience distress,&#xD;
      leading to treatment avoidance. This pilot study will explore women's initial responses to&#xD;
      MBT, the prevalence of adverse responses, and which women are at risk for adverse responses&#xD;
      in a sample of 60 participants with a history of trauma and varying levels of PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
      Study participants will attend one in-person study visit at the Clinical Research Center&#xD;
      (CRC) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), where they will complete self-report&#xD;
      measures of stress and affect before and after one session of a MBT exercise, and obtain ECG&#xD;
      data during the visit. During the CRC visit, data will be collected by a CRC nurse trained to&#xD;
      carry out the study protocol. A subset of the sample will complete a semi-structured&#xD;
      telephone interview within two weeks following completion of the study visit.&#xD;

      The proposed single-group study will use a pre-post design to assess participants' responses&#xD;
      to one exposure to a mindfulness-based body scan in a sample of women with a history of&#xD;
      trauma and varying levels of PTSD symptoms. Quantitative measures will assess self-reported&#xD;
      state positive affect, negative affect, and anxiety before and after the body scan;&#xD;
      physiologic vagal tone before, during, and after the body scan; and psychosocial&#xD;
      characteristics expected to influence responses. Individual semi-structured interviews will&#xD;
      be conducted with a subsample of women to learn about their subjective experiences related to&#xD;
      the body scan.&#xD;

    <description>Positive affect will be measured with The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Short Form (PANAS-SF), a 20-item questionnaire with 10 items assessing positive affect and 10 items assessing negative affect. Participants will be asked to &quot;indicate to what extent you feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment&quot; on a five-point scale; 1 = very slightly or not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit and 5 = extremely. The positive affect score is obtained by adding the scores on items 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17 and 19. The range of the possible total score is 10-50 with higher scores indicating greater positive affect.</description>

    <description>Negative affect will be measured with The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Short Form (PANAS-SF), a 20-item questionnaire with 10 items assessing positive affect and 10 items assessing negative affect. Participants will be asked to &quot;indicate to what extent you feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment&quot; on a five-point scale; 1 = very slightly or not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit and 5 = extremely. The negative affect score is obtained by adding the scores on items 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18 and 20. The range of the possible scores is 10-50 with higher scores indicating greater negative affect.</description>

    <measure>Change in State Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-minute post body scan</time_frame>
    <description>State anxiety will be measured with The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Form (STAI-S), a 20-item questionnaire with equal numbers of anxiety-present (e.g., &quot;I feel tense&quot;) and anxiety-absent descriptors (e.g., &quot;I feel calm&quot;). Participants will be asked to indicate &quot; how you feel right now, that is, at this moment&quot; on a four-point scale; 1= not at all, 2 = somewhat, 3 = moderately so, 4= very much so. The anxiety-absent items (1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20) will be reverse scored, and then all 20-items will be summed to obtain the state anxiety score. The range of the possible scores is 20-80; higher scores indicate greater state anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change in Vagal Tone</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to during body scan to 5-minutes post body scan</time_frame>
    <description>Electrocardiogram (ECG) data will be used to calculate the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) between heartbeats and the high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV). ECG device with sampling rate &gt;250 Hertz and connected to three gel electrodes attached to participants' forearms will be used to collect data with women seated quietly and breathing normally. ECG data will be visually inspected and manually corrected for artifacts, and then used to calculate the RMSSD of adjacent R-R intervals, and HF-HRV (0.15-0.40 Hz) by interpolating and filtering R-R intervals and applying a Fast Fourier Transformation. ECG data will be recorded for 5-minutes before the body scan to establish baseline vagal tone, during the 20-minutes body scan, and for 5-minutes post body scan.</description>
