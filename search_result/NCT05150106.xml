    <textblock>
      The researchers will systematically evaluate current and novel clinical voice assessment&#xD;
      tools and measures to elucidate distinct clinical phenotypes of those with laryngeal dystonia&#xD;
      and voice tremor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Focal laryngeal dystonia (LD) is a rare neurological voice disorder that interrupts speaking&#xD;
      with the intermittent onset of strained-strangled voice quality or causes voicing to stop or&#xD;
      produce sudden breathiness. Those suffering from LD commonly report the onset of symptoms 5&#xD;
      years prior to achieving an accurate diagnosis, despite seeing multiple experts. Voice tremor&#xD;
      (VT) is another neurological voice disorder that is perceived by listeners as shaky voice&#xD;
      quality. Severe VT can result in voice interruptions that sound similar to LD resulting in&#xD;
      misdiagnosis by experts. Recent research shows poor reliability in distinguishing those with&#xD;
      LD from other voice disorders, largely due to the reliance on perceptual assessment methods&#xD;
      and a wide range of clinical criteria without evidence to guide accurate diagnostic&#xD;
      approaches. This is particularly true of VT, a voice disorder without clearly documented&#xD;
      clinical features such that classification is not possible using current movement disorder&#xD;
      consensus-based tremor syndrome criteria. Accurate differential diagnosis of LD from VT is&#xD;
      essential to effective treatment planning and management as well as for accurate clinical and&#xD;
      epidemiologic characterization and classification. The goal of this research is to&#xD;
      systematically characterize individuals with LD and VT using currently available and novel&#xD;
      clinical tools to determine distinguishing clinical features highly predictive of their&#xD;
      correct diagnosis. Clinical phenotypic features will be compared between groups using&#xD;
      acoustic, aerodynamic, laryngeal electromyography (EMG), and nasoendoscopy to quantify&#xD;
      periodicity and task-specificity of voice patterns. Novel assessment tools and measures will&#xD;
      also be used to study body distribution, condition of speech symptoms, and regularity or&#xD;
      intermittency/phoneme-specificity of speech structure movement (kinematic) patterns using&#xD;
      real-time magnetic resonance imaging and nasoendoscopy recordings during sustained phonation&#xD;
      compared to voice- and voiceless-loaded sentences. Computational modeling will be used to&#xD;
      assess aerodynamic, laryngeal EMG and speech structure kinematic patterns to simulate&#xD;
      patient-specific acoustic output predictive of group membership as VT or LD. Outcomes of this&#xD;
      research will significantly advance our clinical and scientific knowledge regarding optimal&#xD;
      clinical tools and measures of LD and VT clinical features that result in a precise diagnosis&#xD;
      of these neurological speech disorders.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18-80 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Native English speakers;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Right-handed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Normal cognitive status;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients will have laryngeal dystonia or voice tremor;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Healthy controls will be healthy individuals without neurological, psychiatric or&#xD;
             otolaryngological problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are incapable of giving informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women until a time when they are no longer pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding. All women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             performed before MRI, which must be negative for participation in the imaging studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a past or present medical history of (a) neurological problems, such as&#xD;
             stroke, movement disorders (other than specified LD and VT in the patient groups),&#xD;
             brain tumors, traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness, ataxias, myopathies,&#xD;
             myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases; (b) psychiatric problems, such as&#xD;
             schizophrenia, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcoholism, drug&#xD;
             dependence; (c) laryngeal problems, such as vocal fold paralysis, paresis, vocal fold&#xD;
             nodules and polyps, carcinoma, chronic laryngitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with any other form of dystonia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have dystonia symptoms at rest or have a presence of mirror dystonia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are not symptomatic due to treatment with botulinum toxin injections into&#xD;
             the affected muscles. The duration of positive effects of botulinum toxin varies from&#xD;
             patient to patient but lasts, on average, for 3-4 months. All patients will be&#xD;
             evaluated to ensure that they are fully symptomatic and are at least 3 months&#xD;
             post-injection before participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. To avoid the confounding effect of centrally acting drugs, all study participants will&#xD;
             be questioned about any prescribed or over-the-counter medications as part of their&#xD;
             initial screening. Those patients who receive medication(s) affecting the central&#xD;
             nervous system will be excluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients will be asked whether they have undergone any head or neck surgery, which&#xD;
             resulted in changes in regional anatomy or innervation. Because brain or laryngeal&#xD;
             surgery may potentially lead to brain structure and function re-organization, all&#xD;
             patients with such a history will be excluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who have certain tattoos and ferromagnetic objects in their bodies (e.g.,&#xD;
             implanted stimulators, surgical clips, prosthesis, artificial heart valve) that cannot&#xD;
             be removed for MRI studies.&#xD;
