  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is associated with surgical complications, including wound healing and&#xD;
      surgical site infection. However, the association between smoking status and postoperative&#xD;
      wound complications is not completely understood. Our objective is to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of smoking on postoperative wound complications for major surgeries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking at the time of surgery is recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular,&#xD;
      respiratory, and wound-related perioperative complications. Wound-related complications can&#xD;
      prolong hospital stays, increase hospital resource utilization, and pose an obvious threat to&#xD;
      patient recovery. A brief statement on perioperative smoking cessation about smoking&#xD;
      impacting wound healing was published by the American Society of Anesthesiologists' Task&#xD;
      Force on Smoking Cessation. Recently, a consensus statement on perioperative smoking&#xD;
      cessation by Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) mentioned&#xD;
      that smoking cessation should be done as soon as practicable with surgical scheduling. More&#xD;
      extended abstinence is associated with lower rates of wound healing complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have described smoking harms wound healing in specific operations, such as&#xD;
      plastic surgery, breast surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, and hip surgery. They found&#xD;
      surgical site infection and wound delayed healing more frequently in smokers. But in a few&#xD;
      small studies and some surgery, conflicting results were found. Besides, risk factors&#xD;
      associated with wound complications include infection, smoking, aging, malnutrition,&#xD;
      immobilization, diabetes, vascular disease, and immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the impact of smoking on wound complications for all kinds of&#xD;
      major surgeries. To clarify the risks, our study uses the updated National Surgical Quality&#xD;
      Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to find if patients who were active smokers are more&#xD;
      likely to have wound-related complications postoperatively. We hypothesized that the active&#xD;
      smoking population will have increased infectious complications and wound dehiscence compared&#xD;
      with the nonsmoking population.&#xD;
