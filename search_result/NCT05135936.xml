  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of water-filtered whole-body hyperthermia during an&#xD;
      outpatient setting in patients with fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is about 3 weeks with two treatment units per week and a passive&#xD;
      period (follow-up measurement) of 24 weeks after the outpatient setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of about 40 participants over 18 years of age are sought, who will be divided into&#xD;
      two groups of equal size after inclusion in the study. All participants will receive the same&#xD;
      amount of water-filtered whole-body hyperthermia within the outpatient setting. One group&#xD;
      receives the gentle form of GKHT, the other group receives the classic, mild GHKT. All&#xD;
      abnormalities are documented by the responsible therapists, doctors and nurses. Changes in&#xD;
      the area of pain and functional limitations as well as the intake of required medication are&#xD;
      also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start and after the completion of the studies, within the clinical stay, blood&#xD;
      parameters were collected. In order to determine the secondary effectiveness of different&#xD;
      questionnaire values are also collected. These are also documented after week 12 and after&#xD;
      week 24, by means of telephone enquiries.&#xD;

    <description>For the study, the method of passive whole-body hyperthermia is used. The IRATHERM®1000 system (Von Ardenne Institute for Applied Medical Research/Dresden) is used, in which the entire body is heated to a core body temperature above the physiological 37°C. The aim is to achieve a core body temperature of 38.5°C within the framework of mild whole-body hyperthermia. After this warm-up phase, a temperature plateau phase of about 60 minutes follows, in which an attempt is made to maintain the core body temperature of 38.5°C. In the temperature plateau phase, a slight increase in the body core temperature is usually observed. The total time required for a session is given as 1.5 to 2 hours, but this depends on the individual constitution and daily condition of the patient and can be subject to fluctuations.</description>

    <description>Within the patient information, privacy policy, etc., there is talk of &quot;gentle hyperthermia&quot; and classic, &quot;mild hyperthermia&quot;. This serves to introduce the sham intervention as a control group compared to the patient. Lighting conditions, procedures, instructions and explanations are indistinguishable. Within the application, patients of the sham group will receive a hyperthermia application almost without overheating. In order to achieve this, the patients will be positioned on the IRATHERM®1000 in accordance with the Von Ardenne Institute's regulations. Due to the insulating blanket and the natural device and body heat, the patients of the sham group experience a gentle warmth, which is not the same as regular whole-body hyperthermia and an increase in the body core temperature of about 1.5 °C. In the sham setting, the core body temperature increases by about 0.3 to 0.4 °C within a 55-minute session.</description>

    <description>The first hyperthermia treatment of the series is carried out for the second aptitude test, directly following the randomisation in the intervention group at the Hospital for Naturopathy and Integrative Medicine in Bamberg. The hyperthermia treatment is then carried out in a cycle of two treatments per week, with at least one day in between, over a period of three weeks, according to the manufacturer's instructions. According to the guidelines, the rectal (possibly vaginal) temperature (as body core temperature), heart rate and oxygen saturation (Sp02) are continuously determined during the hyperthermia treatment. During the treatment, continuous supervision by trained personnel is guaranteed, and a doctor is on call.</description>
