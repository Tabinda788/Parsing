    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial investigates the effectiveness of axillary sentinel or&#xD;
      targeted lymph node biopsy alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients with initial axillary metastasis. For patients with the low nodal disease after NAC,&#xD;
      it is not yet known if radiation therapy causes fewer side effects without compromising&#xD;
      loco-regional control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate long-term survival and life quality in patients with biopsy-proven node-positive&#xD;
      (cN1-N2) breast cancer receiving NAC, followed by limited nodal burden (less than two&#xD;
      positive lymph nodes) by using a (sentinel lymph node biopsy) SLNB or targeted axillary&#xD;
      dissection (TAD) technique, and no further axillary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients with cT1 to cT3 biopsy-proven N1-2 breast cancer rendered cN0 by NAC&#xD;
      underwent SLNB with dual tracer mapping or TAD, and omission of ALND if 2 or more biopsied&#xD;
      nodes were identified and less than 2 biopsied nodes were pathologically positve. Metastatic&#xD;
      nodes were not routinely clipped, and localization of clipped nodes was performed in these&#xD;
      patients. The study was performed in a single cancer center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 6 months for 2 years and then&#xD;
      annually for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 years.&#xD;

        after starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Biopsy of intramammary nodes does not fulfill eligibility criteria; In some&#xD;
             patients, a clip is implanted into positive lymph nodes verified by FNA or CNB under&#xD;
             the guidance of ultrasound 5. Patients must have had estrogen receptor, progesterone&#xD;
             receptor and HER2 status (by immunohistochemistry [IHC] and/or in situ hybridization&#xD;
             [ISH]) evaluated on CNB prior to start of NAC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: If HER2 status has not been clearly determined (i.e. equivocal/indeterminate),&#xD;
             then patients should not be enrolled 6. Patients must have completed all planned&#xD;
             cycles and regimens of NAC prior to surgery; sandwich chemotherapy is not allowed&#xD;
             (i.e. anthracycline/cytoxan or taxane chemotherapy planned to be given after surgery);&#xD;
             patients must have completed at least 4 cycles of NAC consisting of an anthracycline&#xD;
             and/or taxane-based regimen without evidence of disease progression in the breast or&#xD;
             the lymph nodes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Delays/dose modifications due to toxicities/adverse events are allowed as long&#xD;
             as a minimum of 4 cycles of NAC is administered; more than 4 cycles of NAC may be&#xD;
             administered at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist 7. Patients with&#xD;
             HER-2 positive tumors must have received neoadjuvant trastuzumab, or trastuzumab +&#xD;
             pertuzumab, or other approved anti-HER-2 therapy (either with all or with a portion of&#xD;
             the NAC regimen); therapy must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved targeted&#xD;
             anti-HER2 therapy, but additional therapies are allowed as are non-trastuzumab&#xD;

             (no bulky adenopathy) on physical examination documented at the completion of NAC&#xD;
&#xD;

             its findings do NOT impact eligibility 9. No more than 8 weeks of neoadjuvant&#xD;
             endocrine therapy prior to the start of NAC 10. No neoadjuvant radiation therapy 11.&#xD;
             No SLN surgery/excisional biopsy for pathological confirmation of axillary status&#xD;
             prior to or during NAC 12. No prior history of ipsilateral breast cancer (invasive&#xD;
             disease or ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]); lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and&#xD;
             benign breast disease is allowed 13. No prior ipsilateral axillary surgery, such as&#xD;
             excisional biopsy of lymph node(s) or treatment of hidradenitis 14. No history of&#xD;
             prior or concurrent contralateral invasive breast cancer; benign breast disease; LCIS&#xD;
             or DCIS of contralateral breast is allowed 15. Patients must not be pregnant or&#xD;
             nursing&#xD;

             performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intra-Operative Registration/Randomization Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and SLN or targeted axillary dissection&#xD;
             (TAD) surgery must be completed within 30 days of the completion of the last dose of&#xD;
             NAC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. SLNB is rountinely performed after NAC using dual tracer mapping with technetium-99m&#xD;
             sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue dye. Radioactive, blue, or palpably abnormal nodes&#xD;
             were considered SLNs. In patients presenting with clips, localization of the clipped&#xD;
             node was performed and surgeons were aware if the clipped node was retrieved during&#xD;
             the SLNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 total nodes (sentinel + non-sentinel+/-clipped&#xD;
             nodes) are identified and excised; more than 8 biopsied nodes identified by either&#xD;
             surgeon or pathologist is not allowed Note: Patients who do not have an identifiable&#xD;
             SLN will not be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Zero or one lymph node (sentinel + non-sentinel+/-clipped nodes) excised during SLNB&#xD;
             or TAD with a metastasis identified on intra-operative pathologic assessment Note:&#xD;
             Nodal macro/micro-metastasis (greater than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension) and isolated&#xD;
             tumor cells (metastases less than or equal to 0.2 mm) will be treated as node positive&#xD;
             disease (N0i+) Note: If on final pathology, more than 8 lymph nodes are seen&#xD;
             pathologically, or two or more than two nodes turn positive pathologically, then the&#xD;
             patient should not be recruited into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is not to be performed prior to&#xD;
             registration/randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        Post-Operative Registration/Randomization Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For cases where ALND has not been performed and one of the following is true: 1)&#xD;
             intra-operative evaluation of biopsied lymph node (including sentinel or non-sentinel&#xD;
             or targeted nodes) turned to be negative and final pathology identified less than two&#xD;
             positive lymph nodes with metastasis OR 2) biopsied lymph node considered negative on&#xD;
             intra-operative evaluation was found to be positive on final pathology (only one&#xD;
             positive lymph node is allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and sentinel lymph node surgery must be&#xD;
             completed within 30 days of the completion of the last dose of NAC; negative margin&#xD;
             (by either breast conservation or mastectomy) on final pathology where negative margin&#xD;
             is defined as no tumor on ink&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For those patients who also undergo contralateral breast surgery, if invasive disease&#xD;
             is found in the contralateral breast, the patient is not eligible for registration&#xD;
