  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the feasibility of detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from&#xD;
      pilonidal wound dressings to assemble a VOC profile for the assessment of wound healing&#xD;
      trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-healing wounds (NHWs) pose a significant burden to healthcare providers and to affected&#xD;
      patients. Difficulties arise in the identification of wounds which are not on a healing&#xD;
      trajectory. Early identification allows for proactive management to try and reduce healing&#xD;
      time. Recent studies indicate that wound VOCs may have the potential to differentiate between&#xD;
      healing and non-healing wounds. This study will use pilonidal abscesses for the analysis of&#xD;
      wound VOC profiles using a non-invasive technique.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-healing wounds (NHWs) are a worldwide and costly problem. Although NHWs are relatively&#xD;
      small in number, the cost associated for care and product use is disproportionately high. A&#xD;
      recent study from the United Kingdom suggests that wound care accounts for an estimated&#xD;
      Â£8.3bn, or approximately 5.5% of total NHS healthcare costs (Guest 2017). NHWs can cause&#xD;
      pain, stress, isolation, odour, and decreased mobility for the patients and, if the wound&#xD;
      remains after more than 12-24 months, further surgery is required which may be radical and&#xD;
      disfiguring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency presentation of pilonidal abscess requires hospitalisation with incision and&#xD;
      drainage of the abscess cavity. Complete healing occurs in 60% of patients (Deans GT 1998)&#xD;
      and one in five patients represent with recurrent symptoms following emergency surgery&#xD;
      (Jensen 1988). Infection and wound breakdown after elective surgery is also relatively common&#xD;
      affecting 10-15% of patients (Spivak H 1996), making it a good candidate to studying&#xD;
      non-healing wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over the age of 18 who are admitted to hospital with a pilonidal abscess which&#xD;
      requires drainage will be eligible for the study. The patient will undergo the standard&#xD;
      procedure to drain an abscess, during which time wound swabs will be collected. Additional&#xD;
      swabs will be collected for participants in this study, compared to routine care. The wound&#xD;
      will be dressed as standard and the same dressing is applied to an area of un-affected skin&#xD;
      on the buttock. The dressings are changed the following day, and are handled in such a way&#xD;
      that VOC are released and captured from the dressings. These VOC will be sent for analysis&#xD;
      using specialist equipment, which will identify VOC profiles that are unique to each sample.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up 30 days later after treatment to assess the wound-healing&#xD;
      status, which will in turn be linked back to the VOC profile in order to determine whether&#xD;
      associations can be made between the two. The study aims to recruit 12 patients over a 12&#xD;
      month period.&#xD;
