  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to assess the efficacy of educational messages to correct misperceptions. A&#xD;
      large proportion of the American population incorrectly believes that nicotine is the&#xD;
      chemical responsible for causing cancer in tobacco products.1-3 This misconception may reduce&#xD;
      the likelihood that established smokers who are unwilling or unable to quit tobacco product&#xD;
      use completely will switch to less harmful non-combustible products. An online experiment&#xD;
      will be used to test if corrective messages can reduce this misperception. The experiment&#xD;
      will also test the effects of messages on beliefs about the relative harms of other tobacco&#xD;
      products discussed in the message and accuracy of inferential beliefs. This will be&#xD;
      accomplished by asking participants questions about two tobacco products that are not&#xD;
      explicitly discussed in the messages. The experiment will test if the two components of&#xD;
      &quot;narrative coherence,&quot; a concept identified in previous reviews of misperception correction&#xD;
      as effective,4-6 is effective at reducing misperceptions about nicotine. Component 1 provides&#xD;
      an explanation for why the new information is correct and component 2 provides an explanation&#xD;
      for how the false information came to be believed. This study will use a factorial design to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of the component of coherence individually as well as together. Hypotheses&#xD;
      and Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ1: Will participants exposed to different corrective message conditions differ in increased&#xD;
      accuracy of beliefs (a) that nicotine does not cause cancer, (b) regarding the relative risk&#xD;
      of e-cigarettes compared to cigarettes, (c) regarding the relative risk of very low nicotine&#xD;
      cigarettes (VLNC) compared to cigarettes and (d) regarding the relative risk of nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy compared to cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Participants exposed to the nicotine corrective message with both components of coherence&#xD;
      will be significantly more likely to increase accuracy of beliefs regarding the relative&#xD;
      harms of (a) smokeless tobacco compared to cigarettes and (b) cigarillos relative to&#xD;
      cigarettes compared to those exposed to messages with just one component or no components of&#xD;
      coherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Participants exposed to the nicotine corrective message with both components of coherence&#xD;
      will be significantly more likely to increase their intention to switch completely to a&#xD;
      noncombustible product compared to those exposed to messages with just one component or no&#xD;
      components of coherence.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized to view one of four messages. The message conditions are as follows: condition 1 will not contain either component of coherence; condition 2 will contain one element of coherence (a causal explanation for why the corrective information is accurate); condition 3 will contain the other element of coherence (an explanation for why the misinformation came to be believed); condition 4 will include both elements of coherence.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in relative harm beliefs regarding e-cigarettes</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be shown a written description of e-cigarettes before answering questions about them: &quot;The next questions are about electronic cigarettes. You may also know them as e-cigarettes, vapes, vape pens, mods, or by brand names like Juul, Suorin, SMOK, Fin, NJOY, Blu, e-Go, or Vuse. Some look like cigarettes, and others look like small boxes, pens, or pipes. From now on, we will refer to these products as e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes heat up a liquid to aerosolize it so people can inhale it. Although some e-liquid does not contain nicotine, we are only interested in e-cigarettes that DO contain nicotine. Please answer the following questions about e-cigarettes that contain nicotine.&quot; Participants will also see a picture of these products with the description. Response options are, &quot;Much less harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat less harmful,&quot; &quot;Not less or more harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat more harmful,&quot; &quot;Much more harmful.&quot;</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in relative harm beliefs regarding NRT</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be shown a written description of NRT before answering questions about them: &quot;The next questions are about nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). NRT is a medicine that is available as skin patches, chewing gum, nasal and oral sprays, inhalers, lozenges and tablets and delivers nicotine to the body. Nicotine replacement therapy is approved to help people quit smoking.&quot; Participants will also see a picture of these products with the description. Response options are, &quot;Much less harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat less harmful,&quot; &quot;Not less or more harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat more harmful,&quot; &quot;Much more harmful.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in relative harm beliefs regarding very low nicotine cigarettes</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be shown a written description of very low nicotine cigarettes before answering questions about them: &quot;The next questions are about very low nicotine cigarettes. A very low nicotine cigarette is a tobacco cigarette that is still smoked but has the vast majority (95% or more) of the nicotine removed from it. The average regular cigarettes typically contains 12-13 mg of nicotine. A very low nicotine cigarette could have less than 1 mg of nicotine in it. Very low nicotine cigarettes do not contain enough nicotine to maintain a physiological addiction to nicotine. Quest and Moonlight are brands of very low nicotine cigarettes.&quot; Participants will also see a picture of these products with the description. Response options are, &quot;Much less harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat less harmful,&quot; &quot;Not less or more harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat more harmful,&quot; &quot;Much more harmful.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in inferential beliefs regarding smokeless tobacco</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be shown a written description of smokeless tobacco before answering questions about them: &quot;The next questions are about smokeless tobacco. Smokeless tobacco like chewing, oral, or spit tobacco come as loose leaves, plugs, or twists of dried tobacco that may be flavored. It's chewed or placed between the cheek and gum or teeth. The user spits out (or swallows) the saliva that has soaked through the tobacco. Dissolvables are another type of product that dissolves in the mouth and can be sold as lozenges, strips, or sticks. Nicotine is absorbed through the mouth tissues.&quot; Participants will also see a picture of these products with the description. Response options are, &quot;Much less harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat less harmful,&quot; &quot;Not less or more harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat more harmful,&quot; &quot;Much more harmful.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in inferential beliefs regarding cigarillos</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be shown a written description of smokeless tobacco before answering questions about them: &quot;The next questions are about cigarillos. Cigarillos look like small versions of traditional cigars, but can be bought in packages of one or two. Cigarillos smoke is often inhaled, unlike cigar smoke which is often held in the mouth and then released. Cigarillos are often flavored. Swisher Sweets, White Owl, and Dutch Masters are common cigarillo brands..&quot; Participants will also see a picture of these products with the description. Response options are, &quot;Much less harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat less harmful,&quot; &quot;Not less or more harmful,&quot; &quot;Somewhat more harmful,&quot; &quot;Much more harmful.&quot; &quot;Not less or more harmful&quot; will be considered the correct response.</description>

    <measure>Change in beliefs about intention to switch products</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention and immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The extent to which participants agree or disagree with the following statement: I would consider completely switching to a tobacco product that is not lit on fire rather than continuing to smoke cigarettes. Response options are a continuous scale from 0 &quot;I do not agree at all&quot; to 100, &quot;I completely agree.&quot;</description>
