  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive pilot study on a ready-constituted biobank (outside the Jardé Law). It&#xD;
      is an ancillary study to the &quot;GrossPath&quot; cohort (RCB ID number: 2014-A01120-47).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy generates an increased risk of thrombosis, and placenta-mediated diseases&#xD;
      constitute a risk factor for cardiovascular pathologies responsible for significant&#xD;
      maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Understanding and exploring the cellular and&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms of dysfunctions of the vascular-placental interface could provide&#xD;
      arguments to understand the systemic vascular risk, characterize it and finally detect it on&#xD;
      the basis of new markers, thus opening the way for targeted preventive management to&#xD;
      reinforce the general principles of precision medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Netosis is a process of activation of neutrophils, which then generate filaments containing&#xD;
      DNA, enzymes and extracellular histones. Netosis occurs in pregnancy and is increased in&#xD;
      vascular-placental complications. It can be studied by measuring circulating histones,&#xD;
      particularly the citrullinated histone H3. Levels of this modified histone H3, as well as&#xD;
      those of two other modifications, have recently been shown to increase during pregnancy.&#xD;
      These levels have also been shown to be even greater in pregnancy complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to complete this mapping in order to obtain a precise signature for&#xD;
      all post-translational histone modifications in normal pregnancies and pregnancies&#xD;
      complicated by pre-eclampsia from the &quot;GrossPath&quot; cohort in order to propose new circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers for placental vascular pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-translational histone modification profiles (mapping) of pregnant women with normal&#xD;
      pregnancies will be compared with those developing pre-eclampsia.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Analysis of post-translational histone modifications via mass spectrometry</intervention_name>
    <description>During the &quot;GrossHist&quot; study (NCT04205383), only 3 post-translational histone modifications available in ELISA at the time were quantified thanks to a collaboration with the VOLITION™ company [Bouvier and Fortier et al. 2021]. The development of a new mass spectrometry approach based on nucleosome enrichment of plasma, developed by collaborators at VOLITION™, has made it possible to consider the description of all post-translational histone modifications (about 40 post-translational modifications involving histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4).</description>

      This study is based on the mass spectrometric analysis of frozen plasma samples from patients&#xD;
      included in the &quot;GrossPath&quot; cohort (BCR ID: 2014-A01120-47). The benefits will ultimately be&#xD;
      a better understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms involved in the occurrence of&#xD;
      this placental vascular pathology.&#xD;

        The study is based on frozen plasma samples from pregnant women, taken at the time of them&#xD;
        giving birth from among the 50 women who constituted the GrossPath cohort. Fourteen of&#xD;
        these women had had normal pregnancies and fourteen had developed pre-eclampsia. Cases are&#xD;
        matched on maternal age, clinical event (delivery) and gestational age will be included&#xD;
        from the GrossPath cohort.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not applicable as this study is on samples from a biobank. The inclusion criteria for&#xD;
             the &quot;GrossPath&quot; cohort were:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant women followed at Nîmes University hospital for normal pregnancy or pregnancy&#xD;
             with placental vascular pathology (pre-eclampsia and/or intra-uterine growth&#xD;
             retardation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have given her free and informed consent and signed the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be a member or beneficiary of a health insurance plan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only women are included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             criteria of the &quot;GrossPath&quot; cohort were :&#xD;
