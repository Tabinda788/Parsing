  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Preliminary studies show that low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), a new type&#xD;
      of non invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), may be able to reach deep structures of the brain&#xD;
      involved with depression and anxiety, that remain inaccessible using current forms of NIBS&#xD;
      with precision. In this study, the investigators will test if this technique can be used to&#xD;
      change brain activity in areas that are connected to depression and anxiety symptoms. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this study are to test the safety and tolerability of LIFU, evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of using LIFU to reduce brain activity, and evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      simultaneous fMRI-LIFU. If the results of this study are positive, what the investigators&#xD;
      learn will serve as a strong foundation for the future development of innovative treatments&#xD;
      for a variety of psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures: 25 patient and 25 healthy veterans will be recruited. Visits will take&#xD;
      place at the VA Providence Healthcare System. During some visits, healthy and patient&#xD;
      participants may undergo clinical and research neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing,&#xD;
      complete questionnaires, and participate in clinical/neurological assessments. Healthy&#xD;
      veterans will not receive LIFU and will only attend 2 study visits. Patients are expected to&#xD;
      attend up to 8 visits over 6 weeks. However, some may require up to 6 extended follow-ups&#xD;
      after visits 5 or 8, in which case they would attend a total of 11 or 14 visits over 6&#xD;
      months. Two patient visits will include the LIFU application, following FDA safety&#xD;
      guidelines. Patients will be assigned either to an experiment in which LIFU stimulation will&#xD;
      be delivered immediately prior to a task or to an experiment in which stimulation will be&#xD;
      delivered during the task. Within each experiment, patients will be assigned to first receive&#xD;
      either LIFU stimulation to the study target or anatomical control. Study staff, but not&#xD;
      participants will know which location is being targeted in case safety concerns arise. Safety&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted at follow-up visits. A clinician will be available during LIFU&#xD;
      administration /follow-up visits. Assuming no injury or other concerns are present, patients&#xD;
      will then repeat this process again, receiving stimulation targeting other brain area not&#xD;
      previously selected.&#xD;

    <description>MRI safety and monitoring will be determined through the review of clinical MRIs. The clinical MRI will be used to detect possible LIFU-induced injury including edema or other injury and microvascular damage. While the investigators believe hyperacute injury to be unlikely, scans at 24 hours and 1-week will be used to monitor for later evolving injury. If injury is detected on any participant at any stage of the study, the investigators will halt all study procedures.</description>
