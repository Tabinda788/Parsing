      Descriptive : A 12-months multicenter, observational, prospective cohort study. Population :&#xD;
      IBD patients under stable clinical and biological remission will be proposed to switch from&#xD;
      the IV vedolizumab to the SC vedolizumab as part of routine care. All consecutive IBD&#xD;
      patients in IBD centers participating in the study will be proposed to participate in the&#xD;
      study during their regular outpatients' visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives : The primary objective of DOPER study is to describe SC vedolizumab persistence&#xD;
      after switching from IV vedolizumab to SC vedolizumab at month 12.&#xD;

      Number of patients : 400 patients in approximatively 31 sites in France. Recrutment period :&#xD;
      The trial duration for each patient will be 1 year main. Endpoint : The primary endpoint is&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with positive antibodies (VDZ, ANA) comparing therapy with IV and&#xD;
           SC vedolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistence of SC vedolizumab at month 12 in patients previously treated by IV&#xD;
           vedolizumab every 4 weeks, compared to patients treated by IV vedolizumab every 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twelve-month cumulative surgery rates&#xD;
&#xD;
