  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At baseline, participants will complete a 2.5-hours study session. In the study session,&#xD;
      psychophysical assessments of thermal and pressure stimuli will be performed and sex hormone&#xD;
      levels will be analyzed. In addition, demographic, social, pubertal maturation, behavioral&#xD;
      and psychological factors will be collected via questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the optional follow-up portion, participants can complete short surveys every 3 months&#xD;
      and/or return for study visits every year depending on the participant's availability. The&#xD;
      study visits will include the same procedures as the baseline study visit. Additional surveys&#xD;
      regarding new symptoms of pain will be completed. In some cases, participants will meet a&#xD;
      pediatric physician who will determine if they meet the criteria for any pain syndrome (for&#xD;
      research purposes only).&#xD;

    <description>The CPM paradigm assesses endogenous inhibitory pain modulation efficiency related to spatial filtering of nociceptive information. CPM testing includes the application of a &quot;test&quot; stimulus without conditioning (control run) and a subsequent application of the same test stimulus together with a conditioning stimulus (conditioning run). The difference in pain sensitivity between the control and the conditioning run is the CPM response The test stimulus will be A 30-second tonic heat pain at the intensity of 46°C will be delivered to the volar forearm, and pressure pain thresholds at the trapezius.&#xD;
The conditioning stimulus will be immersion of the foot into a cold water bath (8°C). Pain ratings of the water immersion will be collected at the end of the immersion.</description>

    <description>Pressure stimuli: Pressure stimuli will be applied by using a handheld algometer (Wagner Instruments) or the Pressure Algometer (Medoc, Ramat Yishai, Israel). These devices have a round probe that allows quantifying the amount of pressure that is being applied by real-time visual feedback to control and monitor applied pressure rates. Pressure will be applied to the lower leg, volar forearm, or trapezius.&#xD;
Mechanical stimuli: A set of standardised von Frey filaments (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256mN). The contact area of the hairs with the skin is of uniform size (&lt;1 mm²) and texture.</description>
