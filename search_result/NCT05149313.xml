  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI 75 (&gt;=75% Reduction From Baseline in EASI Score) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is used to assess the severity and extent of AD; it is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and or extensive disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 or 1 and 2-point Improvement at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA is an instrument used to globally rate the severity of the participants's AD. It is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe), and a score is selected using descriptors that best describe the overall appearance of the lesions at a given time point. The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting (minimal, palpable induration and significant induration).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 4-point Improvement in Pruritus Numeric Rating Score (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus NRS is an 11-point scale used by participants to rate their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours, with 0 indicating &quot;No itch,&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;Worst itch imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI90</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is used to assess the severity and extent of AD; it is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and or extensive disease. EASI 90 is defined as 90% reduction from baseline in the EASI score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI 75, 90 and 50</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is used to assess the severity and extent of AD; it is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and or extensive disease. EASI 75 is defined as 75% reduction from baseline in the EASI score. EASI 90 is defined as 90% reduction from baseline in the EASI score. EASI 50 is defined as 50% reduction from baseline in the EASI score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Body Surface Area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to AD and is expressed as a percentage of total body surface. BSA will be determined by the Investigator or designee using the participant palm = 1% BSA rule. The participant's palm is measured from the wrist to the proximal interphalangeal and thumb.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD is a validated clinical tool for assessing the extent and intensity of AD. There are 3 components: surface involvement, intensity part and subjective assessment. Surface involvement is assessed as proportion of involved surface area segment by segment by applying the rule of 9s and reported as the sum of all areas, with a score ranging from 0 to 100. Intensity part of the SCORAD consists of 6 items: erythema, oedema, oozing/crusting, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness. Each item is graded as follows: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points). Subjective assessment of itch and of sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom using a visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), for maximum possible score of 20. Formula is: A/5+7B/2+C, A: extent (0-100), B: intensity (0-18), C: subjective symptoms (0-20). The maximum score is 103 (higher values worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus NRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus NRS is an 11-point scale used by participants to rate their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours, with 0 indicating &quot;No itch,&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;Worst itch imaginable.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Sleep Loss Using PRO</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep loss will be assessed by all participants using a patient-related outcome (PRO) instrument. Participants (and if applicable, with help of parents/caregiver if required) will rate their sleep on a 5-point Likert scale (with scores ranging from 0 [not at all] to 4 [unable to sleep at all]). Assessments will be recorded by the participant using an electronic Diary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire completed by the participant (and, if applicable, with help of parents/caregiver if required) to assess disease symptoms. Participants are asked to respond to questions on skin dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping. All answers carry equal weight, with a total possible score ranging from 0 to 28 (answers scored as: No days = 0; 1-2 days = 1; 3-4 days = 2; 5-6 days = 3; every day = 4. A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life (QoL). POEM responses will be captured weekly using an electronic Diary.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)/Children Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item validated questionnaire completed by the participant or caregiver used to assess the impact of skin disease on the participant's QoL during the previous week. The 10 questions cover the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment. Each question is scored from 0 to 3 (&quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;a little,&quot; &quot;a lot,&quot; and &quot;very much&quot;), giving a total score ranging from 0 to 30. A high score is indicative of a poor QoL. The CDLQI is validated from adolescents younger than age of 16 years, which is based on a set of 10 questions different from those of the DLQI. Each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible total score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).</description>
