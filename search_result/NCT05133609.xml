    <textblock>
      A longitudinal open-label study will include health professionals and patients with&#xD;
      immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) who will receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine&#xD;
      (AZD1222), in a standard 3-dose schedule with an interval of 12 weeks (first-second dose) and&#xD;
      24 weeks (second-thrid dose), in the vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 to assess the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy and duration of the short- and long-term humoral and cellular immune&#xD;
      response after vaccination for COVID-19 and compare the vaccine response between individuals&#xD;
      who have or have not had previous SARS-Cov 2 infection.&#xD;

      A longitudinal open-label study that will include individuals who will receive the ChAdOx1&#xD;
      nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222), in a standard 3-dose schedule with an interval of 12 weeks&#xD;
      (first-second dose) and 24 weeks (second-thrid dose), in the vaccination campaign against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 to assess the safety, efficacy and duration of the short- and long-term humoral&#xD;
      and cellular immune response after vaccination for COVID- 19 and compare the vaccine response&#xD;
      between individuals who have or have not had previous SARS-Cov 2 infection. Health&#xD;
      professionals (HS) and patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) who&#xD;
      participate in vaccination campaigns at the Cassiano Antônio Mores da University Hospital&#xD;
      will be included. Federal University of Espírito Santo (HUCAM-UFES). It is intended to&#xD;
      include 200 health workers and 350 patients with IMID, totaling 550 participants.&#xD;
      Participants who have had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR or positive PRNT&#xD;
      at baseline will be considered a group exposed to COVID-19 (CovPrev) and the group without&#xD;
      previous infection will be considered a control group (Naive). The IMID group will include&#xD;
      patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE),&#xD;
      Spondyloarthritis (SA), Sjögren's Syndrome (SS), Psoriasis (Pso), Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
      (IBD) and Vasculitis (VASC) who complete validated international classification criteria for&#xD;
      each disease. The criteria for vaccination in the IMID group will be in accordance with the&#xD;
      National Immunization Program of the Ministry of Health (PNI/MS). Adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded during the first, second and fourth week, and through weekly telephone contacts&#xD;
      until D40. The evaluations and collection of biological samples will be carried out in 5&#xD;
      moments (D0, D14 and D28 after the first dose; D28 after the second dose; and D28 after thrid&#xD;
      dose) to evaluate the efficacy and in 3 moments (D180, D360 and D540), to evaluate the&#xD;
      duration of immunity. Neutralization tests by plaque reduction (PRNT) will be performed to&#xD;
      detect neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19, determination of the profile of specific&#xD;
      IgM, IgA and IgG, dosage of systemic soluble factors (chemokines, cytokines and growth&#xD;
      factors), characterization of phenotypes of immunoregulation, immunosenescence, cell&#xD;
      activation and exhaustion and antigen-specific stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells in vitro. The study hypothesis is that vaccine-induced production of neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies is more effective in individuals with previous natural SARS-Cov2 infection and&#xD;
      less in immunosuppressed individuals.&#xD;
