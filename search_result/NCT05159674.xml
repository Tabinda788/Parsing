  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that the use of dexmedetomidine before and during surgery has a good&#xD;
      sedative, analgesic and circulatory stabilizing effect. The use of dexmedetomidine in&#xD;
      thoracoscopic lung resection has been proven to be safe and feasible, and it has a certain&#xD;
      degree of improvement in postoperative lung function. Combining the advantages of&#xD;
      thoracoscopy and the previous experience of combined acupuncture and drug anesthesia&#xD;
      technology, our team pioneered cardiopulmonary surgery without endotracheal intubation and&#xD;
      combined needle and drug anesthesia, so that the patient was in a state of light sleep and&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing without tracheal intubation. After completing the operation, it was&#xD;
      found that this technical method can effectively reduce the amount of intraoperative&#xD;
      anesthetics, improve intraoperative lung ventilation, improve lung oxygenation, achieve&#xD;
      intraoperative organ protection, and significantly reduce complications caused by tracheal&#xD;
      intubation , Postoperative analgesic drugs have reduced the amount of 20%, accelerate the&#xD;
      time of exhaust and defecation, and its postoperative rehabilitation is better than&#xD;
      conventional treatment. These results suggest that the combination of acupuncture and&#xD;
      medicine is not only suitable for anesthesia, it can be used scientifically and rationally in&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia, immune regulation and even the entire perioperative organ&#xD;
      protection, creating more possibilities for patients' ERAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In combined acupuncture and drug anesthesia, the core goal is to use acupuncture to reduce&#xD;
      the insufficiency of anesthetics in terms of analgesia, sedation, stable circulation, and&#xD;
      protection of organs. However, the mechanism of action behind this type of combination has&#xD;
      not yet been improved. Efficacy kinetics or pharmacokinetics has been explained convincingly,&#xD;
      or it is not well recognized. For example, is there a specific target in the body of&#xD;
      acupuncture? If there is a specific target, where is the effect target? If the combined&#xD;
      application of acupuncture and medicine produces a synergistic effect through a&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic mechanism, its specific mechanism still needs to be clarified.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usually in a disease state, the body is in a state of strong stress, and the body's redox&#xD;
      balance is disrupted. This state will also affect the activity of metabolic enzymes in the&#xD;
      body, which in turn will have a corresponding impact on drug metabolism. Therefore, the&#xD;
      body's basic redox level The monitoring of the drug is very important for the clinical&#xD;
      development of individualized dosing regimens and the combined acupuncture and drug&#xD;
      anesthesia mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern pharmacokinetic studies have shown that 90% of drugs (including most anesthetics) will&#xD;
      undergo the metabolism of CYP enzyme and UGT enzyme, that is, their substrates. These drugs&#xD;
      are mostly used in combination of multiple drugs in clinical practice. Therefore, it is not&#xD;
      only necessary to study the individual change law of its single drug use, but also the change&#xD;
      law of its multi-drug sharing and mutual influence. The original intention of sharing or&#xD;
      combining drugs is to be beneficial to the patient, but when the common interaction between&#xD;
      the shared drug and the original drug has a harmful effect on the body, adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions will occur, which is also called drug-drug interaction (Drug-Drug Interaction DDI),&#xD;
      and the production of DDI is nothing more than pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interactions. Therefore, when combining drugs or combined acupuncture and drug anesthesia, it&#xD;
      is also necessary to monitor the effects and effects of metabolic enzymes in the body on the&#xD;
      drugs first, and then to determine the safety and the mechanism of the effect of multi-drug&#xD;
      sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that the combination of acupuncture and medicine produces&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effects such as increased endorphins, reduction of stress, immune function&#xD;
      regulation, and up-regulation of endorphin receptor activity. Therefore, this study will&#xD;
      start from these aspects. To design research on the mechanism of combined acupuncture and&#xD;
      drug anesthesia, we hope to observe objective evidence of pharmacokinetics or&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics that significantly reduces the use of anesthetics.&#xD;
