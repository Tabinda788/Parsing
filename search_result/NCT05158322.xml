  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb joint replacement surgery is one of the most prevalent globally. In our center,&#xD;
      more than 400 lower limb arthroplasties (LLA) are performed annually. Developing a Surgical&#xD;
      Site Infection (SSI) after (LLA) increases morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus is the main causative agent of SSI and especially in LLA. One third of&#xD;
      the population is a nasal carrier of Staphylococcus aureus, being a risk factor for patients&#xD;
      who have to undergo knee replacement or hip replacement. Several studies have confirmed that&#xD;
      the detection of S. aureus carriers and their subsequent decolonization reduces SSI rates&#xD;

      Implementation of a screening of all patients who have to undergo lower limb arthroplasty in&#xD;
      our center, decolonization of patients with a positive screening result for S. aureus and&#xD;
      subsequent follow-up.The circuit is established in the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative Nurse Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oral and written information on the study and procedure is given, the informed consent&#xD;
           will be signed, and the sample (nasal swab) is collected from all patients scheduled for&#xD;
           lower limb arthroplasty surgery in our center. The sample is sent to microbiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It will be recorded in the computerized medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the sample has been run by rapid circuit at 24 hours or conventional at 4 days, the&#xD;
           Consultation Nurse reviews the results of the screened patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. In case of negative screening, patients follow the usual clinical practice circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. In case of positive screening, the patients are summoned the next day to&#xD;
           Consultations to give and explain the decolonization treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Indication of decolonization to S. aureus:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following treatment is prescribed and facilitated in the nurse's office and will be&#xD;
           recorded in the history:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intranasal mupirocin every 8h. for 5 days (in case of resistance, intranasal&#xD;
                fusidic acid is given every 12 hours for 5 days). Treatment is always carried out 7&#xD;
                days before the day of admission for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chlorhexidine gluconate (single-dose sachets) daily shower until the day of&#xD;
                admission for the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-decolonization control S. aureus:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient is asked about adherence to treatment and a nasal smear is performed in the&#xD;
           Presurgical Unit. In the event that the Innervencion is before the end of the treatment.&#xD;
           It is not deprogrammed, but the treatment will continue until it is completed. The&#xD;
           control nasal smear, in these cases, will be collected at the first treatment in the&#xD;
           nurse's office. The satisfa&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patients will be followed for 6 weeks, a period in which an infection is considered&#xD;
           an acute surgical site, it will be recorded if the infection is due to S. aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The circuit will be evaluated in relation to efficacy and impact (number of patients&#xD;
           operated on, number of screening, number of S. aureus positives, number of&#xD;
           decolonizations and if they have been effective, number of S. aureus infections after&#xD;
           The proposed intervention and treatment will be compared with the infections of the same&#xD;
           period of the year 2019.ction survey of the decolonization protocol (VAS 0-10) will be&#xD;
           carried out.&#xD;
