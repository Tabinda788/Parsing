  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 Vaccine HIPRA in adult healthy volunteers in Vietnam&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population includes 256 healthy adults aged 18-60 which will be randomized in a&#xD;
      ratio 1:1 test:commercial vaccine. Each participant will receive 2 immunisations separated by&#xD;
      21 days and will be followed for 24 weeks after the second dose.&#xD;
