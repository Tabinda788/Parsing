    <description>Scale measures level of upper extremity motor functions (min-max: 18-126 points). Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>initial, 3th week 9th week changes</time_frame>
    <description>Scale measures performance in activities of daily living. The Index yields a total score out of 100 - the higher the score, the greater the degree of functional independence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale version 3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>initial, 3th week 9th week changes</time_frame>
    <description>Scale has 8 domains: strength, hand function, mobility, physical and instrumental activities of daily living, memory and thinking, communication, emotion, and social participation. Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate a better Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate a better. The scale also includes a question (item 50) to assess the patient's global perception of recovery. The respondent is asked to rate his or her percentage of recovery on a visual analog scale of 0 to 100, with 0 meaning no recovery and 100 meaning full recovery.</description>

    <measure>Box and Block Test</measure>
    <time_frame>initial, 3th week 9th week changes</time_frame>
    <description>The Box and Block Test (BBT) measures unilateral gross manual dexterity. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>initial, 3th week 9th week changes</time_frame>
    <description>Scale measures muscle tone (spasticity) (min-max:0-4). Higher values represent a worse outcome</description>

    <measure>The amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs)</measure>
    <time_frame>initial, 3th week 9th week changes</time_frame>
