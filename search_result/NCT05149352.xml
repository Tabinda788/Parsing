  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a recurrent and progressive course.&#xD;
      Around 25% of depressive patients has experienced moderate to severe levels of childhood&#xD;
      trauma (CT), resulting in earlier onset and more severe and recurrent depressions. There is&#xD;
      currently no targeted treatment for CT-related depression. This is problematic as patients&#xD;
      with CT-related depression respond poorly to standard depression treatments. The&#xD;
      RESET-psychotherapy study proposes an innovative, targeted disease-modifying treatment&#xD;
      strategy for CT-related depression. The main objective is to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      trauma-focused therapy (TFT), as an addition to regular depression treatment ('treatment as&#xD;
      usual'; TAU), in reducing depression symptom severity in patients with CT-related depression.&#xD;
      158 adult patients will be randomized to receive a 12-week treatment with 1) TAU or 2) TFT in&#xD;
      combination with TAU. The primary outcome measure is defined as depression symptom severity&#xD;
      after 12 weeks treatment (post-treatment), measured with the Inventory of Depressive&#xD;
      Symptomatology - Self Rated (IDS-SR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a recurrent and progressive course.&#xD;
      Even though antidepressants and psychotherapy are often effective, a substantial proportion&#xD;
      of patients does not respond to currently used evidence-based treatments. Around 25% of&#xD;
      depressive patients has experienced moderate to severe levels of childhood trauma (CT),&#xD;
      ranging from physical and emotional neglect to emotional, physical and sexual abuse. There is&#xD;
      increasing evidence that depression related to childhood trauma (CT) is critically different&#xD;
      from non-CT related depression: it emerges earlier in life with more severe and recurrent&#xD;
      symptoms and has worse treatment outcomes. Therefore, there is a large and unmet need for&#xD;
      novel therapeutic strategies for CT-related depression. Currently, there is no targeted&#xD;
      treatment available for CT-related depression. Given the major role of trauma in CT-related&#xD;
      depression, it is plausible that trauma-focused psychotherapies may be effective in this&#xD;
      depression subtype. The current study aims to investigate the effectiveness of trauma-focused&#xD;
      therapy (TFT), as an addition to 'treatment as usual' (TAU), in reducing depression symptom&#xD;
      severity in patients with CT-related depression. It is expected that trauma-focused therapy&#xD;
      will be a safe and rational strategy to enhance resilience and improve depression outcomes&#xD;
      for patients with CT-related depression. RESET-psychotherapy is a 12-week randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial (single-blind RCT), in which TFT in combination with TAU will be&#xD;
      compared to TAU only at various specialized mental healthcare units of mental health care&#xD;
      institutions. The study population will consist of 158 adult patients who have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      moderate to severe depression (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders (DSM-5)) and moderate to severe childhood trauma (CT). The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is defined as depression symptom severity after 12 weeks treatment (post-treatment), measured&#xD;
      with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Rated (IDS-SR). Data will be collected&#xD;
      during multiple assessments: at baseline (T0), after 6 weeks (T1), after 12 weeks (T2;&#xD;
      post-treatment), and after 6 months post-treatment (follow-up, T3). Information about&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, childhood trauma and other health-related outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      using self-report questionnaires and semi-structured clinical interviews. In addition, to&#xD;
      better understand how and for who TFT works, stress-related biomarkers (hair cortisol,&#xD;
      inflammatory and epigenetic biomarkers in the blood) will be examined pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment. A sub-group of patients (N=60, 30 per intervention group) will be asked to&#xD;
      undergo fMRI scans pre- and post-treatment to measure stress-related brain activity (fMRI&#xD;
      sub-study, Â±60 minutes per fMRI session).&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Treatment as usual (TAU) for depression</intervention_name>
    <description>TAU for depression will be largely determined by the Dutch multidisciplinary practice guideline on depression (Spijker et al., 2013). This means that patients with CT-related depression will receive good clinical care, e.g. evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) combined with/or pharmacotherapy. Therapists who give TAU are not allowed to provide a trauma-focused intervention aimed at CT during the 12-week intervention period.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Trauma-focused therapy (TFT)</intervention_name>
    <description>The content of TFT, delivered by another therapist than the therapist that will provide TAU, depends on the type of CT the patient reports. If the patient predominantly reports experiences of abuse, there are often clear memories of this abuse ('target images') present and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is recommended as the treatment strategy. If the patient predominantly reports experiences of neglect, memories are often less identifiable, although these experiences can have a big impact on the development of maladaptive schemas. In this case, imagery rescripting (ImRs) is recommended as treatment strategy. If the patient reports both experiences of abuse and neglect, the therapist will discuss with the patient which type of CT has the greatest impact on the current depressive symptoms and starts with the indicated therapy. If indicated, the therapist can switch between EMDR and ImRs after a minimum of 4 sessions.</description>
