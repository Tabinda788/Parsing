    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective primary data collection study. The duration of&#xD;
      observation is 2 years after study enrolment date. Disease and treatment history will be&#xD;
      retrospectively reviewed from medical record at enrollment with no time limits for the key&#xD;
      diagnosis of enrolment (plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and&#xD;
      non-radiographic axial spondyloarthropathy).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the baseline visit, data will be collected for each patient prospectively every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years. At each visit, effectiveness parameters, as well as the patients'&#xD;
      QoL and treatment pattern will be documented.&#xD;

Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems.

    <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) assesses a subject's level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both upper and lower extremities. There are 20 questions in 8 categories of functioning including dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and usual activities. The stem of each item asks 'Over the past week, &quot;are you able to...&quot; perform a particular task'. Each item is scored on a 4 point scale from 0 - 3, representing normal, no difficulty (0), some difficulty (1), much difficulty (2) and unable to do (3). The disability index score is calculated as the mean of the available category scores, ranging from 0 to 3. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.(Only at sites where HAQ-DI score is part of clinical routine).</description>
