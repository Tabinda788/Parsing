  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study GO43104 is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of lurbinectedin in&#xD;
      combination with atezolizumab compared with atezolizumab alone administered as maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in participants with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) after&#xD;
      first-line induction therapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab. The study&#xD;
      consists of 2 phases: an induction phase and a maintenance phase. Participants need to have&#xD;
      an ongoing response or stable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor&#xD;
      (RECIST) v1.1 criteria after completion of 4 cycles of carboplatin, etoposide, and&#xD;
      atezolizumab induction treatment in order to be considered for eligibility screening for the&#xD;
      maintenance phase. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      lurbinectedin plus atezolizumab or atezolizumab in the maintenance phase.&#xD;
