    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if there are significant differences in periodontal&#xD;
      conditions between patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment with stainless steel or&#xD;
      ceramic brackets. For this study, patients will be enrolled and divided into two groups,&#xD;
      according to the type of brackets (stainless steel or ceramic) used for orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment. A professional supragingival and subgingival oral hygiene will be performed before&#xD;
      the bonding of the orthodontic brackets together with a periodontal evaluation will be&#xD;
      recording the following periodontal indices: PPD, BoP, BS, GI, PI, BEWE and Schiff Air Index.&#xD;
      Indices will be recorded after 1, 3 and 6 months after the bonding, separately for both in&#xD;
      maxillary and in mandibular dental arches and only for teeth with brackets bonded.&#xD;

      This clinical trial aims to investigate if there are significant differences in periodontal&#xD;
      conditions between patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment with stainless steel or&#xD;
      ceramic brackets. Patients recruited for the study will be asked to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent. Parents will sign the consent for underage patients. A professional supragingival&#xD;
      and subgingival oral hygiene will be performed before the bonding of the orthodontic&#xD;
      brackets; a piezoelectric instrument and Gracey curettes will be used. After that, patients&#xD;
      will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group MET: stainless steel brackets will be bonded on the vestibular surfaces of teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group CER: ceramic brackets will be bonded on the vestibular surfaces of teeth. Before&#xD;
           the bonding on maxillary dental arch, a periodontal evaluation will be conducted&#xD;
           recording the following periodontal indices: PPD, BoP, BS, GI, PI, BEWE and Schiff Air&#xD;
           Index. Indices will be recorded after 1, 3 and 6 months after the bonding, separately&#xD;
           for both in maxillary and in mandibular dental arches. Only teeth with brackets bonded&#xD;
           will be considered.&#xD;
