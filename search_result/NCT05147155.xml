    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic inflammation in the small airways of patients with severe asthma is considered&#xD;
      to be an important marker of disease severity. In clinical trials, treatment with mepolizumab&#xD;
      reduces exacerbation rates by almost a half along with modest improvements in symptom scores&#xD;
      and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) early after the first month of commencing&#xD;
      mepolizumab treatment. However, there is an apparent discrepancy between major&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes and lung function that should be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been reported that mepolizumab improves small airway function in severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma as detected by multiple-breath nitrogen washout test. The improvement in&#xD;
      small airway function was seen rapidly after the first mepolizumab injection and was&#xD;
      associated with a sustained response in the majority of patients. However, gaps in knowledge&#xD;
      about the choice of device, gas, and standardization across systems are key issues leading&#xD;
      the committee to conclude that multiple-breath nitrogen washout test is not ready for use as&#xD;
      a clinical trial endpoint in asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that early improvement in small airway function may be a&#xD;
      significant contributor to the therapeutic response of anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody therapy&#xD;
      in patients with severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma. The investigators speculate that&#xD;
      SAD could be effectively evaluated using IOS. Consequently, this study could lead to novel&#xD;
      SAD subtypes with possible clinical relevance in the context of treatment with anti-IL-5&#xD;
      factor. The investigators hypothesize that healthy individuals and patients with severe&#xD;
      controlled asthma would disclose a lesser extent of SAD than patients with severe&#xD;
      uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma with or without fixed airway obstruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE Asthma is an inflammatory airways disease affecting the entire bronchial&#xD;
      tree. The importance of small airways in asthma has been well documented. Small airways are&#xD;
      defined as those with an internal diameter of 2 mm or less, which is referred to as the&#xD;
      silent zone of the lungs. Small airway disease (SAD) is present across patients with all&#xD;
      stages of asthma, but it is particularly prevalent in those with more severe disease and more&#xD;
      frequent symptoms. Particularly, the silent zone has been related to asthma control,&#xD;
      severity, and risk of exacerbation. SAD is more prevalent in asthmatic patients with fixed&#xD;
      airflow obstruction compared to asthmatic patients without fixed airflow obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small airways contribute to the resistance in the airways of patients with obstructive&#xD;
      airways disease. It was estimated that total small airways resistance was 24% of total airway&#xD;
      resistance in healthy adults and increased to 34% in asymptomatic newly diagnosed patients&#xD;
      with asthma and 51% in patients with severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural alterations at the peribronchiolar level contribute to the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      functional abnormalities observed in patients with severe asthma. Remodeling can affect small&#xD;
      airway wall stiffness, thereby changing their distensibility. An increase in type collagen,&#xD;
      matrix metalloproteinase, and fibronectin and a decrease in collagen III localized to the&#xD;
      outer part of the lung were found in patients who died of asthma. It has been recently&#xD;
      documented that those structural abnormalities in patients with severe asthma are associated&#xD;
      with a higher frequency of exacerbations, worse asthma severity, quality of life, and asthma&#xD;
      control. Moreover, it has been reported reproducibly higher alveolar NO concentrations in the&#xD;
      refractory asthma group compared to the mild-moderate asthma group, supporting the hypothesis&#xD;
      that refractory asthma is associated with distal lung inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is increasingly recognized that the small airways play an important role in&#xD;
      severe asthma and SAD may complicate severe asthma treatment, it is notoriously difficult to&#xD;
      measure small airways inflammation and/or dysfunction. SAD is a complex and silent signature&#xD;
      of severe asthma that is likely to be directly or indirectly captured by combinations of&#xD;
      physiological tests, such as spirometry, body plethysmography, impulse oscillometry (IOS),&#xD;
      and multiple breath nitrogen washout. For clinical practice, it is important to adopt&#xD;
      easy-to-use clinical measures, such as IOS and spirometry, to delineate various severe asthma&#xD;
      SAD subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heterogeneous airway narrowing is a significant marker of severe asthma related to resistance&#xD;
      and reactance. IOS seemed to have better sensitivity to detect SAD than effort-dependent&#xD;
      forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75%). Spirometry, which is the standard&#xD;
      method for measurement of pulmonary function, is unlikely to reflect the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      SAD since it measures bulk flow propagating predominantly from the larger central airways;&#xD;
      therefore, there are limitations in detecting changes in small airways and airway trapping in&#xD;
      patients with asthma. Furthermore, spirometry performance remains challenging for many&#xD;
      elderly patients who have comorbidities that affect the test procedure, as well as in cases&#xD;
      where patient cooperation is lacking, such as children or patients with physical and&#xD;
      cognitive limitations. Therefore, a more readily available test for SAD is crucial for&#xD;
      patient assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of commercialized forced oscillation technique (FOT) devices to assess impedance in&#xD;
      obstructive diseases such as asthma has gained popularity. The earlier FOT instruments&#xD;
      allowed only one sound frequency to be passed at a time. Some of the more recent FOTs now use&#xD;
      sound waves of two or three different frequencies at one time. IOS is an improvised technique&#xD;
      of that FOT that could use multiple sound frequencies at one time. Although FOT devices are&#xD;
      generally comparable, IOS is the most commonly used type of FOT in clinical practice. IOS is&#xD;
      a noninvasive and convenient technique to measure both airway resistance and reactance during&#xD;
      tidal breathing by an effort-independent and patient-friendly modality for evaluating lung&#xD;
      function and peripheral airway dysfunction, providing an extensive description of oscillatory&#xD;
      pressure and giving better mathematical analyses of resistance and reactance using the fast&#xD;
      Fourier transform (FFT) technique compared to FOT. In FOT, the sound waves of different&#xD;
      frequencies were transmitted sequentially, whereas in IOS, an impulse, which can be&#xD;
      mathematically decomposed into different frequencies, is transmitted. This helps in reducing&#xD;
      the time of the test and also provides a high signal-to-noise resolution. Resistance can be&#xD;
      conceptualized as a sound wave requires to travel through the airways and inflate the lung.&#xD;
      The reactance of the respiratory system is composed of the inert and elastic properties of&#xD;
      the respiratory system. The sum of the forces ahead of the sound wave (resistance) and those&#xD;
      generated behind the sound wave in response to the pressure of the wave (reactance) equal the&#xD;
      impedance of the entire respiratory system; thus permits passive measurement of lung&#xD;
      mechanics. Importantly, IOS can differentiate small airway obstruction from large airway&#xD;
      obstruction and is more sensitive than spirometry for peripheral airway disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical classification of SAD into subtypes by use of IOS is meaningful, given its&#xD;
      association with Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) severity stages, asthma control, quality&#xD;
      of life, and exacerbations. IOS can be useful in determining baseline lung function,&#xD;
      demonstrating a response to bronchodilator or bronchoprovocation, and predicting asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations and loss of disease control especially, in children and elderly with&#xD;
      obstructive airway diseases. Moreover, the SAD subtype classification with IOS has been used&#xD;
      to determine the inhaled corticosteroids particle size is needed for proper airway&#xD;
      inflammation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eosinophilic inflammation in the small airways of patients with severe asthma is considered&#xD;
      to be an important marker of disease severity. In clinical trials, treatment with mepolizumab&#xD;
      reduces exacerbation rates by almost a half along with modest improvements in symptom scores&#xD;
      and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) early after the first month of commencing&#xD;
      mepolizumab treatment. However, there is an apparent discrepancy between major&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes and lung function that should be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been reported that mepolizumab improves small airway function in severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma as detected by a multiple-breath nitrogen washout test. The improvement&#xD;
      in small airway function was seen rapidly after the first mepolizumab injection and was&#xD;
      associated with a sustained response in the majority of patients. However, gaps in knowledge&#xD;
      about the choice of device, gas, and standardization across systems are key issues leading&#xD;
      the committee to conclude that the multiple-breath nitrogen washout test is not ready for use&#xD;
      as a clinical trial endpoint in asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few months, it has been documented that FOT could be an effective method to&#xD;
      document and monitor the efficacy of mepolizumab in treating severe eosinophilic asthma. In&#xD;
      this study, FOT detected early treatment-induced changes in peripheral airways function. This&#xD;
      study included 18 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, candidates for mepolizumab&#xD;
      therapy, and no other control groups were enrolled. These preliminary results motivate&#xD;
      further prospective studies to evaluate respiratory mechanics using other FOT devices such as&#xD;
      the IOS; thus enriching the knowledge regarding the small airway asthma phenotype by&#xD;
      unlocking the lung's quiet zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that early improvement in small airway function may&#xD;
      be a significant contributor to the therapeutic response of anti- interleukin 5 (IL-5)&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma. The&#xD;
      investigators speculate that SAD could be effectively evaluated using IOS. Consequently, this&#xD;
      study could lead to novel SAD subtypes with possible clinical relevance in the context of&#xD;
      treatment with an anti-IL-5 factor. The investigators hypothesize that healthy individuals&#xD;
      and patients with severe controlled asthma would disclose a lesser extent of SAD than&#xD;
      patients with severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma with or without fixed airway&#xD;
      obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The investigators sought to describe early changes in respiratory mechanics by&#xD;
      means of IOS in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma commencing mepolizumab treatment.&#xD;
      The detected parameters will be compared to a group of matched for age and gender healthy&#xD;
      controls as well as with a group of patients with severe controlled asthma matched for age&#xD;
      and gender requiring high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) /long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)&#xD;
      combination therapy to prevent asthma from becoming uncontrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study Population The sample will consist of 40 patients between 18 and 82 years of&#xD;
      age with uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma despite receiving high-dose ICS/LABA&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Approximately 1000 patients with asthma per year are treated in the external Unit of&#xD;
      Asthma of Respiratory Medicine Department of the University of Thessaly in Greece.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, in order to certainly achieve the estimated study sample size, to maximize the&#xD;
      response rate, and to reduce survey error, the Respiratory Medicine Department of the&#xD;
      University of Thessaly will cooperate with a network of private respiratory physicians in&#xD;
      Central and Northern Greece that serves a population base of about 3,000,000. Asthma&#xD;
      education programs will regularly take place to raise severe asthma awareness, improve asthma&#xD;
      control and management by creating a community Interlink between Respiratory Medicine&#xD;
      Department and the private sector from across central and northern Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the Respiratory Medicine Department of the University of Thessaly, via more than&#xD;
      12 clinical-community partnership spirometry surveillance programs with ten primary Health&#xD;
      Care Centers in Central and Northern Greece, has already created a network of researchers,&#xD;
      experts, and healthcare practitioners which is vitally important to early identify patients&#xD;
      with uncontrolled asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Verbal and written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before the&#xD;
      study, according to the Helsinki declaration. The protocol has already been approved by the&#xD;
      Larissa University Hospital Ethics Committee (Approval number: 48841/25/10/2019) Target&#xD;
      enrolment/sample size: (Required for clinical studies) 130 (40 patients with severe&#xD;
      uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma commencing mepolizumab treatment, 40 patients with severe&#xD;
      controlled asthma medicating with high dose ICS/LABA combination therapy, and 50 healthy&#xD;
      individuals matched for age and gender). This Clinical Trial will be sponsored by an external&#xD;
      sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods This will be a 2-year prospective, cohort study. Patients will&#xD;
      receive mepolizumab, which will be administered as a 100-mg subcutaneous dose every four&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects will be present for subcutaneous mepolizumab (100 mg) injection initially at&#xD;
      visit 0 (Week 0), then for reassessment at two (Week 2) and four weeks (Week 4) and continued&#xD;
      monthly treatment with reassessment at three (Week 12) and six months (Week 26). The patients&#xD;
      will not alter their usual treatment regimen between Week 0 and Week 12; thus mitigating any&#xD;
      other potential confounder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed lung function tests will be performed at visit 0 in the following order: the&#xD;
      fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), IOS performance then spirometry and lung volumes&#xD;
      measurement. All testing will be conducted before and 30 minutes after the mepolizumab&#xD;
      injection. Asthma control and quality of life questionnaires will be filled. All testing will&#xD;
      be conducted on Week 0, Week 4, Week 12 and Week 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements At each clinic visit, the investigators will evaluate the results of&#xD;
      spirometric, IOS, and lung volumes tests and will administer the 5-item Asthma Control&#xD;
      Questionnaire (ACQ-5), Asthma Control Test (ACT), and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (AQLQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5) Symptom control will be determined using the&#xD;
      symptom-only 5-item asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5). A score &gt; 1.5 indicates poor&#xD;
      control and an individual change &gt; 0.5 is clinically important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma Control Test (ACT) The ACT will provide us with a snapshot of how well asthma has been&#xD;
      controlled over the last four weeks, giving a score out of 25. A score of less than 20 means&#xD;
      that asthma may not have been controlled during the past four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)&#xD;
      is a 20-item self-administered questionnaire that covers four dimensions (breathlessness,&#xD;
      mood, social limitation, and worrying) and gives a total score and subscales scores. Patients&#xD;
      have to respond to a series of statements describing how asthma (or its treatment) affects&#xD;
      them and indicate which option closely applies to them over the past four weeks. A score of&#xD;
      10 corresponds to a maximum impairment of quality of life and a score of 0 corresponds to no&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function tests Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The fraction of exhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide (FeNO) (MEDISOFT, MEDICAL GRAPHICS CORP, Minnesota, USA) will be performed according to&#xD;
      the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines. Recommended&#xD;
      cutoff values for normal FeNO levels &lt; 25 parts per billion (ppb) and elevated FeNO &gt; 50 ppb&#xD;
      have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) IOS measurements will be performed in triplicate according to&#xD;
      standard guidelines, with a Jaeger MasterScreen IOS system (Carefusion, Germany, JLAB&#xD;
      software version 5.22.1.50). A volume calibration will be performed daily using a 3-L volume&#xD;
      syringe, and the accuracy of resistance measurements will be confirmed daily using a standard&#xD;
      0.2 Kpa.s.L-1 resistance mesh. Each patient will be seated upright, wear a nose clip, and&#xD;
      press on their cheeks with their hands to prevent an upper airway shunt. To avoid air&#xD;
      leakage, patients will seal their lips tightly around the mouthpiece. While the impulse will&#xD;
      be produced by the speaker is moving with the patient's breathing, a pressure and flow&#xD;
      transducer will be measure inspiratory and expiratory flow and pressure changes in the&#xD;
      respiratory system. Mean values for resistance at 5 Hz (R5: indicates total airway&#xD;
      resistance); resistance at 20 Hz (R20: approximates central airway resistance); the&#xD;
      difference between R5 and R20 (R5-R20: considered to be an index for small airways);&#xD;
      reactance at 5 Hz (X5: relates to compliance); resonant frequency (Fres); and integrated area&#xD;
      of low-frequency X (AX) values will be derived as previously reported. Fres and AX are values&#xD;
      that detect expiratory flow limitations. R5-R20 and AX are thought to reflect changes in the&#xD;
      quiet zone of the lungs. IOS data will be carefully reviewed offline and quality-assured by&#xD;
      expert clinicians, to reject segments affected by airflow leak or swallowing artifacts.&#xD;
      Acceptability criteria for IOS measurements will include coherence values of â‰¥0.6 at 5 Hz,&#xD;
      between test coefficient of variation of Zrs of &lt;15% (with a minimum of three tests) and the&#xD;
      absence of the following features within the flow tracings gauged by visual inspections&#xD;
      (swallowing, glottis closure, leak around the mouthpiece, improper seal with the nose clip).&#xD;
      The best of three acceptable attempts with the lowest respiratory resistances will be chosen&#xD;
      for the final data analysis. During this study, one technician will obtain all IOS&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry Spirometry (Spirolab, MIR, Rome, Italy) will be performed according to ATS/ERS&#xD;
      guidelines. Predicted values will be derived from the Global Lung Initiative. To avoid any&#xD;
      negative effects of forced expiration on the airway, spirometry will never be performed&#xD;
      before the IOS measurements. The percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC), the percent&#xD;
      predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%FEV1), the FEV1/FVC ratio, the percent predicted&#xD;
      the maximal mid-expiratory flow (%MMEF), and the percent predicted peak expiratory flow&#xD;
      (%PEF) would be obtained. The best of at least three technically acceptable results will be&#xD;
      selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constant volume plethysmograph Lung volumes measurement total lung capacity (TLC), residual&#xD;
      volume (RV), the ratio of RV/TLC], and airway resistance (Raw) will be measured in a constant&#xD;
      volume plethysmograph (CardinalHealth, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan or Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using the statistical program SPSS 22 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY,&#xD;
      USA). Quantitative variables will be presented as mean with standard deviation (SD), and&#xD;
      qualitative variables will be presented as frequencies with percentages. Chi-square test will&#xD;
      be used to explore any associations between qualitative variables. To identify differences&#xD;
      between two independent groups when the dependent variable will be either be ordinal or&#xD;
      continuous, unpaired t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests will be used for normally distributed&#xD;
      and skewed data, respectively. Differences between more than two unrelated groups will be&#xD;
      tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A result will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant when the P-value will be &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first study to investigate small airway dysfunction using IOS in patients&#xD;
      with severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma commencing mepolizumab treatment. While&#xD;
      oscillometry measurements are portrayed as a marker of small airway dysfunction, the normal&#xD;
      reference ranges or threshold to define SAD has not been established yet. However, IOS has&#xD;
      many advantages as is the most commonly used type of FOT in clinical practice including the&#xD;
      use of simple tidal breathing maneuvers against forced maneuvers applied in spirometry and&#xD;
      thus require less effort, while it demonstrates a change in early disease wherein spirometry&#xD;
      is normal.&#xD;

             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will be medicated with at least 880 Î¼g of fluticasone propionate or the&#xD;

          -  Poor symptom control (frequent symptoms or reliever use, activity limited by asthma,&#xD;
             night waking due to asthma), defined as ACQ consistently â©¾1.5 or ACT&lt;20.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Frequent exacerbations (â‰¥2/year) requiring oral corticosteroids, or severe&#xD;
             exacerbations (â‰¥1/year) requiring hospitalization or burst of systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
             (â‰¥3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will have an eosinophil count of at least 150 cells per microliter in the&#xD;
             peripheral blood at screening or at least 300 cells per microliter at some time during&#xD;
             the previous year.&#xD;
