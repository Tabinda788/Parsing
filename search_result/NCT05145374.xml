      The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a viable, functionally integrated&#xD;
      multivariable artificial pancreas (mvAP) that will address meal, physical activity (PA) and&#xD;
      acute psychological stress (APS) challenges without any manual inputs to better regulate&#xD;
      glucose levels of people with diabetes. Acute psychological stress and many other forms of PA&#xD;
      besides planned exercise can affect blood glucose levels and cause challenges to maintaining&#xD;
      euglycemia for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Various PA and APS affect the&#xD;
      metabolism and sensitivity to insulin in different ways. Hence, their types, intensities and&#xD;
      durations, and their individual and concurrent presence must be detected in order to&#xD;
      determine the optimal insulin administration. The mvAP approach provides a well-integrated&#xD;
      and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates the effects of&#xD;
      unexpected PA and APS inducements. Twenty subjects with type 1 diabetes (ages 18-60) who use&#xD;
      insulin pumps enrolled in this study. The study will take place at the UIC-College of Nursing&#xD;
      Diabetes and Exercise Laboratory. The protocol will include 1 screening visit and 5 sessions&#xD;
      at the laboratory. The primary activities at each meeting will include: (1) screening; (2)&#xD;
      measurement of peak exercise capacity; (3) estimation of maximal strength from submaximal&#xD;
      strength tests; (4) Trier Social Stress Test; (5) submaximal bouts of aerobic and resistance&#xD;
      exercise, and activities of daily living with and without stress (e.g., mental calculations,&#xD;
      video games). These activities will be included visit 3, 4 and 5 as appropriate. In addition,&#xD;
      subjects will perform activities at home include: housekeeping chores, stationary bike (if&#xD;
      available); treadmill (if available); walking; and light weights (if available).&#xD;
      Periodically, the research assistant will call the subject during these times and ask them to&#xD;
      perform stress-inducing activities while performing the activity. The stress inducing&#xD;
      activities will include mental challenges such as a mathematical computation while performing&#xD;
      the activity. The subjects will be called at home 3-5 times during the study. The fully&#xD;
      automated algorithm will be tested in a home setting, however, the methodology will be&#xD;
      developed and approved for testing later in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of an artificial pancreas (AP) has gained considerable progress over the last&#xD;
      decade. The goal of AP systems is to develop a device that will provide insulin on demand in&#xD;
      response to blood glucose levels in the same manner as the own pancreas. The first generation&#xD;
      of AP systems, the hybrid closed-loop AP, collects data from continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
      (CGM) devices and relies on manual user inputs for mitigating the effects of meals and&#xD;
      physical activities. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a viable, functionally&#xD;
      integrated multivariable artificial pancreas (mvAP) that will address meal, physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) and acute psychological stress (APS) challenges without any manual inputs to better&#xD;
      regulate glucose levels of people with diabetes. Acute psychological stress and many other&#xD;
      forms of PA besides planned exercise can affect blood glucose levels and cause challenges to&#xD;
      maintaining euglycemia for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Various PA and APS&#xD;
      affect the metabolism and sensitivity to insulin in different ways. Hence, their types,&#xD;
      intensities and durations, and their individual and concurrent presence must be detected in&#xD;
      order to determine the optimal insulin administration. The mvAP approach provides a&#xD;
      well-integrated and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates&#xD;
      the effects of unexpected PA and APS inducements. The objective of this proposal is to&#xD;
      demonstrate a viable, functionally integrated mvAP that will address meal, PA and APS&#xD;
      challenges without any manual inputs to better regulate glucose levels of people with T1DM.&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that a new generation multivariable AP that incorporates real-time&#xD;
      detection and determination of the characteristics of PA and APS and mitigation of their&#xD;
      effects by automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in people&#xD;
      with T1DM. Additionally, this technology will be safer compared to APs based exclusively on&#xD;
      CGM data, by reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events. Such&#xD;
      mvAP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that uses&#xD;
      real-time information from CGMs and physiological variables obtained from wearable devices&#xD;
      worn in free-living daily life. It is proposed to build on this framework a fully automated&#xD;
      mvAP technology that will mitigate meal, PA and APS challenges, including unexpected and&#xD;
      unplanned events. The specific aims of the proposed research are: Aim 1. To develop the mvAP&#xD;
      algorithms and modules that identify various types of physical activities, acute&#xD;
      psychological stress episodes, their concurrent presence and their characteristics in real&#xD;
      time. Aim 2a: To conduct open-loop studies in clinic and in free living to expand the types&#xD;
      and intensities of PA and APS inducements, to enrich our database with data collected during&#xD;
      activities of daily living (alone or coupled with APS), including unplanned spontaneous PA&#xD;
      and APS events. Aim 2b:To extend our multivariable glucose-insulin-physiological variables&#xD;
      simulator (mGIPsim) for in silico studies of the mvAP for simulating APS inducements and&#xD;
      their effects on glucose levels and physiological variable outputs of the simulator. Aim 3:&#xD;
      To conduct clinical experiments with the second generation mvAP in clinical settings and in&#xD;
      free living to assess the performance of our fully-automated mvAP in closed-loop operation.&#xD;
      At this time, IRB approval for Aim 1, 2a and 2b has been obtained. Aim 3 will be. conducted&#xD;
      at a later date. The clinical studies will take place at the University of Illinois at&#xD;
      Chicago (UIC)-College of Nursing and at the subjects' home. The protocol will include 1&#xD;
      screening visit and 5 sessions at the laboratory. The primary activities at each meeting will&#xD;
      include: (1) screening; (2) measurement of peak exercise capacity; (3) estimation of maximal&#xD;
      strength from submaximal strength tests; (4) Trier Social Stress Test; (5) submaximal bouts&#xD;
      of aerobic and resistance exercise, and activities of daily living with and without stress&#xD;
      (e.g., mental calculations, video games). These activities will be included visit 3, 4 and 5&#xD;
      as appropriate. In addition, subjects will perform activities at home include: housekeeping&#xD;
      chores, stationary bike (if available); treadmill (if available); walking; and light weights&#xD;
      (if available). Periodically, the research assistant will call the subject during these times&#xD;
      and ask them to perform stress-inducing activities while performing the activity. The stress&#xD;
      inducing activities will include mental challenges such as a mathematical computation while&#xD;
      performing the activity. The subjects will be called at home 3-5 times during the study. The&#xD;
      fully automated algorithm will be tested in a home setting. Once the methodology needs is&#xD;
      refined Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the Aim 3 will be obtained.&#xD;
