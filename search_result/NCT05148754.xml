  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is an open-label, single-center, clinical study of the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      safety of Elsulfavirin 200 mg tablets in four dosage regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort I (N = 3). Single oral dose of 400 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort II (N = 3). Single oral dose of 800 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort III (N = 3). Single oral administration at a dose of 1200 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort IV (N = 6). A single 1200 mg oral dose followed by 200 mg daily for 9 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is descriptive and will not test any hypotheses. Based on previous studies and the&#xD;
      intended descriptive objectives of the study, no control group is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure safety, the following scheme for using the investigational drug is provided:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inclusion in the study of volunteers included in each subsequent cohort will be&#xD;
           carried out strictly after the completion of the study by the last study subject&#xD;
           included in the previous cohort and obtaining a safety opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosing in the multiple administration cohort will be 2 + 4. Initially, 2 volunteers will&#xD;
           be included, after completion of participation, 4 more volunteers will be dosed.&#xD;
