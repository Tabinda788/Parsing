      This is a prospective study on the prevention of Neratinib-related diarrhea in a Chinese&#xD;
      population, exploring the best options for reducing the incidence of neratinib-related&#xD;
      diarrhea through either pharmacologic intervention (prophylactic antidiarrheal therapy) or&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic intervention (dose escalation program).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is A prospective, randomized, single-center clinical trial, divided into 3 groups&#xD;
      (experimental group: group A and group B, control group: group C), planned sixty patients&#xD;
      were enrolled, with 20 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: Group A (n=20) and group B (n=20) were given neratinib dose escalation&#xD;
      regimen foranti-HER2 adjuvant therapy.In group A, the dose of neratinib climbed up to 240mg&#xD;
      within 2 weeks, and in group B, the dose climbed up to 240mg within 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Group C (n=20) was given 240mg neratinib initially, but prophylactic&#xD;
      loperamide antidiarrhea treatment was given at the same time within 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diarrhea caused by neratinib often occurred within 1-2 months of initial treatment, so small&#xD;
      dose of neratinib was used in both group A and group B at the time of initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and severity of neratinib-related diarrhea in the three groups were observed,&#xD;
      and DFS and other neratinib-related adverse events were followed up for a long time. The&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neratinib dose escalation regimen and&#xD;
      conventional dose combined with loperamide regimen in enhanced anti-HER2 adjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      early HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;
