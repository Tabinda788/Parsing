      Aim of the work Evaluate the lower indeterminate CBD strictures trying to reach possible&#xD;
      diagnosis by all available methods i.e brush cytology ,bile aspirate cytology , tissue biopsy&#xD;
      ,imaging studies and laboratory work up then treatment of the patient either endoscopically&#xD;
      or surgically according to the etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approvals and consents This study will be done after obtaining approval by the medical ethics&#xD;
      committee of sohag faculty of medicine.A written informed consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      participants before being enrolled in the study and prior to performing the procedure .the&#xD;
      study will be registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentation The common presentation is one or more of Charcot's triad ;Jaundice&#xD;
      ,Fever and Pain with itching and dark urine and pale clay stool Also the patient may be&#xD;
      presented by Pain in the upper right side of the abdomen (biliary pain) ,nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      By examination yellowish discoloration of skin and sclera and mucous membrane , and itching&#xD;
      marks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accidental diagnosis of indeterminate stricture may be discovered in asymptomatic patient&#xD;
      during imaging study (MRCP , US), or during ERCP for any other cause i.e common bile duct&#xD;
      stone after stone extraction accidently a distal CBD stricture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      routine investigations: CBC , coagulation profile, kidney function liver function : total&#xD;
      \direct bilirubin ductal enzymes i.e Alkaline phosphatase ,gamma glutamyl transferase GGT,&#xD;
      5-nucleotidase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour markers for cases suspected to be malignant and old aged patients: CA19.9 ,AFP&#xD;
      (alpha-fetoprotein) ,and CEA (carcino-embryonic antigen)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      imaging US ,MRCP routinely done for all cases Triphasic CT abdomen and pelvis if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic Technique ERCP done routinely for all cases of indeterminate lower common bile&#xD;
      duct stricture to help reaching diagnosis. The patient is positioned in prone position with&#xD;
      slight elevation of the right shoulder to improve the orientation . the anesthesia will be&#xD;
      propofol intravenous as sedation with monitoring of the vital signs. introduction of the&#xD;
      scope till facing the papilla, iv injection of hyoscine butyl bromide will decrease duodenal&#xD;
      motility and allow easy successful cannulation followed by Sphincterotomy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      By injection of bilograffin contrast The radiological configuration of the stricture in the&#xD;
      cholangiogram is either irregular with shouldering suggesting malignancy or smooth tapered&#xD;
      nature suggesting benign stricture . Also the cholangiogram will evaluate the stricture if it&#xD;
      is affecting long or short CBD segment .After cannulation and sphincterotomy a guide wire&#xD;
      will be introduced in the biliary passage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy either punch biopsy if there's papillary overgrowth will be taken by biopsy forceps or&#xD;
      core biopsy from the stricture itself will be taken during ERCP and sent for histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brush cytology After confirmation of the Presence of CBD stricture which is distal in&#xD;
      position &quot;beyond cystic duct &quot; by the cholangiography , a double lumen cytology brush will&#xD;
      passed into bile duct beyond the stricture over a guide wire .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brush will be pushed into the stricture as this region will be abraded by rapid forward&#xD;
      and back movement of the brush more than 5-6 times . finally the brush will be pulled in the&#xD;
      catheter sheath again, and both the brush and the sheath will be removed from the endoscope&#xD;
      as a unit . The samples will be divided into two parts one for CCE &quot;Conventional cytology&#xD;
      evaluation&quot; and the other for Digital image Analysis( DNA histogram) examination .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile Aspirate Cytology In some cases bile aspirate will be done before injecting the contrast&#xD;
      in the bile duct ,The sample will be centrifuged and the sediment will be used to perform CCE&#xD;
      and DIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each patient ,two samples obtained one of them will be fixed immediately in 2 ml of&#xD;
      phosphate buffer solution and will be sent for DIA. The other sample will be sent to&#xD;
      pathology center at Sohag University for conventional cytology evaluation CCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be preserved in 75 % alcohol .Centrifugation will be done for 30 minutes and the&#xD;
      sediment will be directly smeared onto one or more glass slides ,fixed using alcohol based&#xD;
      fixative and stained with Papanicolaou stain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells will be labelled as malignant based on the following criteria; loss of honeycombing&#xD;
      ,loss of polarity ,increased nuclear size ,increased nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, chromatin&#xD;
      clumping, nuclear molding and presence of dirty ,necrotic or bloody background .Absence of&#xD;
      such features will be consistent with benign nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytometric estimation of DNA aberration is commonly expressed as DNA index (DNA-I). This&#xD;
      index is a measure of DNA aneuploidy or abnormal DNA content . DNA-I of 1.0 represents a&#xD;
      normal diploid DNA content .&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA ploidy analysis will be done by BD cycle test TM plus DNA kit (BD ;san joe ,CA95131&#xD;
      ,USA). DNA histogram will be generated for ploidy analysis automatically by plotting&#xD;
      individual nuclear DNA content against number of nuclei.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly ,five samples will taken from five patients with benign biliary obstruction other&#xD;
      than stricture &quot;calcular obstructive jaundice) to assign DNA histogram and DNA-I of normal&#xD;
      biliary cells. Results of DNA-I will placed into 1 of 4 categories, which identified nuclei&#xD;
      with DNA indices between 0.95 and 1.05 (diploid), 1.06 and 1.89(aneuploid or S phase), 1.90&#xD;
      and 2.10 (tetraploid), or greater than 2.10 (hypertetraploid). Aneuploid ,tetraploid ,and&#xD;
      hypertetraploid are considered positive for malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dilatation and stenting Therapeutic role of ERCP is very important ,After diagnosing the&#xD;
      stricture frequent dilatation by disposable soehendra biliary dilatation catheter will be&#xD;
      done or by balloon dilatation.Then stent insertion will be done and upgraded later on&#xD;
      according to the stricture .Benign strictures are more amenable for endoscopic dilatation by&#xD;
      ERCP in one or more than one ERCP sessions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignant stricture which is inoperable managed endoscopically with ERCP and metal stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS EUS used in some cases to determine the nature of stricture and its criteria if it is&#xD;
      regular smooth or irregular infiltrative to the surroundings or it is compressing&#xD;
      extraluminal mass lesion. EUS guided FNA cytology will be done from any suspicious lesions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strictures proved to be benign will undergo endoscopy but surgery is mandatory in case of bad&#xD;
      patient compliance for endoscopy; the operation will be shunt operation ( bilio-enteric&#xD;
      anastomosis) in the form of :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proximal choledocho-duodenostomy (side to side)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proximal choledocho-jejunostomy (side to side)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proximal choledocho-duodenostomy (end to side) with excision of the strictured segment .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proximal choledocho-jejunostomy (end to side) with excision of the strictured segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strictures proved to be malignant if operable will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excision of the stricture with safety margin + shunt operation (bilio-enteric&#xD;
           anastomosis end to side) + regional draining LNs block dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pancreatico-duodenectomy (Whipple's operation) Strictures proved to be malignant if&#xD;
           inoperable will undergo: endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Follow up of the patients will be for 6-9 months post treatment . those with lower&#xD;
      common bile duct (CBD strictures managed endoscopically will undergo ERCP sessions for stent&#xD;
      upgrading and re-evaluation of the stricture .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up Clinically or by imaging studies (US, MRCP , CT abdomen) if&#xD;
      needed to detect the progression of the disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data will be collected in preformed data collection from prior to being&#xD;
      entered in the spread sheet. Statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical&#xD;
      package for social science (SPSS).continuous variables will be expressed as mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (normal distributed data) or median and range (not normal distributed data) while&#xD;
      categorical data expressed as numbers and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi square test will be used to compare the nominal data while continuous data will be&#xD;
      compared by student t test(normally distributed data) and Mann Whitney test (not normally&#xD;
      distributed data).&#xD;
