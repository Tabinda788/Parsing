  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the improvement of people's living standard, the prevalence of Diabetes is increasing&#xD;
      year by year. In present, 350 million people worldwide are suffering from diabetes, and by&#xD;
      2035, there will be as high as 600 million. Diabetes causes a variety of complications,&#xD;
      including diabetic nephropathy, which is one of the most common complications of Diabetes.&#xD;
      Diabetic nephropathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes. Microalbuminuria and&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate decrease are the main manifestation. Even more, it can progress to&#xD;
      end-stage renal changes. Data showed that diabetic nephropathy accounts for about 40% of&#xD;
      patients with end-stage renal disease receiving renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the treatment of diabetic nephropathy is still lacking. In the past 40 years, few&#xD;
      drugs have been proven to ameliorate the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Even though,&#xD;
      the renal function of a large number of diabetic nephropathy patients is gradually&#xD;
      deteriorating. Therefore, it is urgent to find a therapeutic drug that acts on different&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trimetazidine is a piperazine derivative. It is mainly used in the treatment of stable angina&#xD;
      pectoris. Its safety has been well verified. In recent years, the role of trimetazidine in&#xD;
      acute renal damage has been widely reported. A large number of studies have shown that&#xD;
      trimetazidine can reduce the effect of contrast agent on renal function and reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of contrast nephropathy. There fore, Trimetazidine is a promising drug for delaying&#xD;
      the progression of diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;

      In the present study, there will be 2 groups last for 6 months. One is the control group, who&#xD;
      will not receive trimetazidine and the another is the trimetazidine group, who will receive&#xD;
      the treatment of trimetazidine, 35mg bid orally.&#xD;
