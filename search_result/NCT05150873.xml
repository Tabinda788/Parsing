      In clinical practice a lot of EVAR cases are performed IFU for adverse neck anatomy(6) with&#xD;
      acceptable short- and mid-term outcomes, but the long-term durability is currently an issue&#xD;
      (7). Neck length shorter than 15 mm and angulation are two of. neck charteristics. that&#xD;
      contribute more to define an &quot;hostile neck&quot; (8). The issue linked to the anatomical not&#xD;
      feasibility of standard EVAR in patients not eligible for OR can be solved with custom made&#xD;
      devices (CMD), but they were limited by high production costs and long time for creations&#xD;
      (10-12 weeks)1. Nowadays no one off-the-shelf device aimed to overcome neck hostility in AAA&#xD;
      is available on the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims at evaluating the anatomical applicability of an off-the-shelf&#xD;
      scalloped stent-graft (Treovance, Terumo Aortic) to treat infrarenal AAA with a short and/or&#xD;

      Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is currently accepted as the preferred choice to treat&#xD;
      the abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) with a feasible anatomy. Although approximately 40-60%&#xD;
      of AAA patients are not considered anatomically feasible for EVAR, mainly in reason of a&#xD;
      &quot;hostile neck anatomy&quot;. In ''real-world'' clinical practice, up to 44% of EVAR cases are&#xD;
      performed outside Instruction For Use (IFU) for adverse neck anatomy. The off-label use of&#xD;
      standard EVAR is currently used for patients who are not eligible for OR, with acceptable&#xD;
      short- and mid-term outcomes, Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is currently accepted as&#xD;
      the preferred choice to treat the abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) with a feasible anatomy.&#xD;
      Although approximately 40-60% of AAA patients are not considered anatomically feasible for&#xD;
      EVAR, mainly in reason of a &quot;hostile neck anatomy&quot;3-5. In ''real-world'' clinical practice,&#xD;
      up to 44% of EVAR cases are performed outside Instruction For Use (IFU) for adverse neck&#xD;
      anatomy6. The off-label use of standard EVAR is currently used for patients who are not&#xD;
      eligible for OR, with acceptable short- and mid-term outcomes, but the long-term durability&#xD;
      of EVAR depends on the maintenance of the seal between the endograft and the aortic neck as&#xD;
      well as the iliac arteries7. Some aortic neck characteristics contribute in the definition of&#xD;
      ''hostile neck,'' particularly length shorter than 15 mm and angulation among others8. From a&#xD;
      recent Consensus Conference, the influence of each characteristic on early or late EVAR&#xD;
      failure is not clear, but hostile neck morphology is generally associated with higher rates&#xD;
      of aneurysm-related adverse events and mortality. A recent independent Expert Panel, applying&#xD;
      the Delphi methodology Indeed, agreed to define 10 mm as the threshold value below which&#xD;
      standard EVAR should not be considered feasible. Moreover, the same experts agreed on the&#xD;
      fact that an angulation above 60Â° is considered a hostile criterion for EVAR procedure.&#xD;
      Finally should be considered that some &quot;hostility&quot; factors can be present at the same time&#xD;
      and creating the ideal condition for EVAR failure9. The issue linked to the anatomical not&#xD;
      feasibility of standard EVAR in patients not eligible for OR can be solved with custom made&#xD;
      devices (CMD), but they were limited by high production costs and long time for creations&#xD;

      The present study aims at evaluating the anatomical applicability of an off-the-shelf&#xD;
      scalloped stent-graft (Treovance, Terumo Aortic) to treat infrarenal AAA with a short and/or&#xD;
      angulated neck. From ann informal review of some CTA of patientns treted with EVAR or OR in&#xD;
      uor unit we found that more the 20% presented a distannce between the two rennal arteries&#xD;
      more than 5mm. The idea of and &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; graft with a single scallop theoretically had&#xD;
      to permit to gaing some lenght along aortic neck. Forthenmore also in caso of angulation a&#xD;
      sinngle scallop theorically reduced the risk of bird beck and gutter. The aim of thhe study&#xD;
      is to evaluatte if a single scalloped &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; stent graft could be appliable and&#xD;
      feasible in an adeguatte number of patients.&#xD;
