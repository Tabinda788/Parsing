  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is often reported as the most common complication after a laser refractive surgery.&#xD;
      Any refractive procedure can lead an impact on the corneal surface and the tear film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of this dry eye is the corneal denervation caused by the destruction of the&#xD;
      anterior stromal nerves during the ablative procedure. This loss of corneal sensitivity leads&#xD;
      to a decrease in the blink reflex, a decrease in the secretion rate of the meibomian glands&#xD;
      and finally an evaporated dry eye. There is also a chronic inflammation at the corneal&#xD;
      surface that produces an increase of inflammatory cytokines and a dysfunction of the&#xD;
      meibomian glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yu et al have described incidences of dry eye closed to 60% after the first month of LASIK.&#xD;
      Hovanesian et al have observed dry eye symptoms in 50% of patients 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
      Donnenfeld et al describe 15% of moderate dry eye in the following 3 months and 5% of severe&#xD;
      dry eye in the first 6 months. A small number of patients will present with chronic dry eye&#xD;
      symptoms for more than 1 year. Bower et al analyzed its incidence in 0.8% Alterations in the&#xD;
      tear film also decrease the quality of the retinal image and produce greater number of&#xD;
      high-order due to the irregular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed light therapy (IPL) applied preoperatively in patients who undergo a laser refractive&#xD;
      surgery may prevent the post-surgical dry eye and improve the refractive results. The aim of&#xD;
      our study is to evaluate the usefulness of the applied therapy for the prevention of dry eye&#xD;
      in patients that undergo a corneal refractive procedure.&#xD;

      1. Design Clinical experimental controlled trial, double-blind in which participants will&#xD;
           be randomized into 2 groups: a study group (IPL + laser refractive surgery) and a&#xD;
           control group (laser refractive surgery without IPL).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted in accordance with Law 14/2007 of 3 July, on Biomedical&#xD;
           Research, the Declaration of Helsinki (October 2013 version), standards of Good Clinical&#xD;
           Practice and legislation in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants included in the study should read the Information Sheet and sign the&#xD;
           informed and voluntary consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants Participants from Vissum Clinic that present the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
           none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will start the study with a preliminary project and depending on the&#xD;
           results obtained, the investigators will apply these values to calculate the final&#xD;
           sample size using the T-student-Fischer test for unilateral hypotheses and for a type 1&#xD;
           or α error of 5%. and a type 2 or β error of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parameters evaluated Primary measures: age, sex, skin phototype, visual acuity with and&#xD;
           without correction, refraction, cycloplegic refraction, OSDI and VAS questionnaire, use&#xD;
           of artificial tears, oxford scale, lacrimal meniscus height, tear break-up time,&#xD;
           conjunctival hyperemia, meibography and slit lamp examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary measures: corneal topography and tomography (MS-39, CSO, Italy), corneal&#xD;
           aberrometry (MS-39, CSO, Italy), ocular aberrometry (Osiris, CSO, Italy), analysis of&#xD;
           contrast sensitivity (CSV-1000, Vector vision), photographic capture of the epithelial&#xD;
           defect in PRK, pre-surgical and postsurgical photographic capture of the eyelid changes&#xD;
           in PRK.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The measurement of the different objective variables will be carried out in the clinic.&#xD;
           The measurement of the subjective variables will be carried out by two ophthalmologists,&#xD;
           both masked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Surgery and follow-up Participants who are candidates for a LASIK or SMILE procedure&#xD;
           will receive, after randomization, IPL treatment in both eyes (experimental group) or&#xD;
           sham IPL (control group). In the case of participant candidate for a PRK procedure, an&#xD;
           intra-subject control group will be used, where one eye will receive the IPL treatment&#xD;
           (right eyes) and the left contralateral eye the sham IPL treatment (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Refractive surgeries will be performed exclusively two ophthalmologists following the&#xD;
           same surgical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IPL therapy (M22, Lumenis LTD, Israel) will be performed following the same protocol&#xD;
           (standardized facial and periocular application with automatically adjusted energy&#xD;
           according to Fitzpatrick skin classification). Three IPL sessions will be applied&#xD;
           (simulated in the case of the control group): 7 days before the intervention, 7 days&#xD;
           after the intervention, and 30 days after the intervention. The total postsurgical&#xD;
           follow-up will be 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analyses All demographic and clinical data will be collected in a database&#xD;
           and analyzed with the SPSS statistical package for Windows version 22.0. A p &lt;0.05% will&#xD;
           be considered significant.&#xD;
