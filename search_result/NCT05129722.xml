  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) in Australia affects 1-2% of the population. Heart failure with preserved&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFpEF) refers to a syndrome of clinical heart failure without impairment&#xD;
      of systolic cardiac function. HFpEF has few therapeutic agents that are proven to improve&#xD;
      outcomes and it was only recently, the published EMPEROR-Preserved trial demonstrated that&#xD;
      empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) reduced composite outcome&#xD;
      of heart failure hospitalisation and cardiovascular death by 21% among patients with&#xD;
      HFpEF.[1] HFpEF therapies have traditionally aimed at providing symptomatic relief and&#xD;
      treating coexisting illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre randomised clinical trial aims to establish the feasibility of a fixed low&#xD;
      dose combination polypill consisting of bumetanide 0.5 mg, eplerenone 25 mg, and&#xD;
      empagliflozin 10 mg in patients with HFpEF compared against empagliflozin 10 mg monotherapy&#xD;
      in patients with HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fixed dose combination low dose diuretics of this nature have not been rigorously studied in&#xD;
      patients with HFpEF, and this study aims to help improve the treatment paradigm for this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) refers to a complex syndrome of&#xD;
      clinical heart failure without impairment of systolic cardiac function. HFpEF accounts for&#xD;
      more than half of patients with heart failure, and this prevalence continues to increase in&#xD;
      population studies. Unlike Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), there are&#xD;
      few therapeutic agents that are proven to improve outcomes such as heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalisation in this group. The recently published EMPEROR Preserved trial demonstrated&#xD;
      that empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), reduced the&#xD;
      composite outcome of heart failure hospitalisation and cardiovascular death by 21% (95% CI:&#xD;
      10% to 31%) among patients with HFpEF. This was the first study to meet this clinical&#xD;
      endpoint in HFpEF patients. In addition to reducing hospitalisation and CV death, additional&#xD;
      therapies in HFpEF are aimed at providing symptomatic relief, through intravascular volume&#xD;
      management with diuretics, and treating coexisting illnesses. However, patients may&#xD;
      experience diuretic resistance that leads to lower efficacy of diuresis despite increasing&#xD;
      doses; this, in turn, can lead to progression of renal dysfunction and other side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers and clinicians must develop strategies to help improve efficacy of diuresis and&#xD;
      avoid diuretic resistance, which may be possible through the use of multiple diuretics at&#xD;
      lower doses and including newer agents such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre, double-blinded, randomised (1:1), proof-of-concept, pilot trial aims to&#xD;
      establish the feasibility of a fixed low dose combination polypill consisting of bumetanide&#xD;
      0.5 mg, eplerenone 25 mg, and empagliflozin 10 mg in patients with HFpEF compared against&#xD;
      empagliflozin 10 mg monotherapy in patients with HFpEF. There will be 15 patients per arm&#xD;
      (n=30 across two sites). The study will recruit patients from the community including&#xD;
      cardiology clinics, primary care providers and will be undertaken in the Royal Prince Alfred&#xD;
      (RPA) Cardiology Clinic and St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia Cardiology Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary implementation hypothesis for this study is that it is feasible to recruit 30&#xD;
      participants to this trial over 6 months and to complete 4 weeks of follow up, with adherence&#xD;
      to the protocol and study related procedures (screening, randomisation, study drug&#xD;
      allocation, follow-up procedures, and retention) in &gt;/=80% of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several secondary hypotheses including that the proposed polydiuretic, as compared&#xD;
      to SGLT2i, empagliflozin monotherapy on top of usual care will: increase medication&#xD;
      compliance, improve rates of optimal medical therapy, reduce N-terminal pro hormone BNP,&#xD;
      improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class, reduce fluid overload, improve blood&#xD;
      pressure, and body weight at 4 weeks alongside exploratory outcomes of change in their KCCQ.&#xD;
      Additionally, the safety hypotheses include that patients will have no increase in Adverse&#xD;
      events, Serious Adverse Events, or Adverse events of special interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fixed dose combination low dose diuretics of this nature have not been rigorously studied in&#xD;
      patients with HFpEF, and this study aims to help improve the treatment paradigm for this&#xD;
      patient population. This combination of agents draws upon the existing nature of evidence&#xD;
      based therapies used in HFpEF that target the kidney.&#xD;
