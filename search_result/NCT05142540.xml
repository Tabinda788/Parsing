  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate the ability of a COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) booster&#xD;
      vaccine to induce a salivary antibody response and investigate a possible correlation with&#xD;
      the serum antibody response and the cellular response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a prospective single center cohort study including fully&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective single center cohort study including fully&#xD;
      vaccinated probands.. The study will take place at the Medical University of Graz. Blood and&#xD;
      saliva samples will be obtained before the third booster vaccination, 3-8 weeks, and 6 months&#xD;
      after the third booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is 15 months, starting in November 2021 with a recruiting&#xD;
      period until June 2022 and termination of all scheduled visits until January 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be enrolled, participants must be 18 years or older, able to understand study&#xD;
      procedures, provide written informed consent (Biobank informed consent and study specific&#xD;
      informed consent).Scheduled vaccination for the booster vaccination with Comirnaty or&#xD;
      Spikevax will allow recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1, after informed consent, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked to&#xD;
      include or exclude the subject in the trial. Clinical history will be assessed and blood&#xD;
      (32ml - Serology, T cell immunity) and saliva (1.5ml) will be taken. At visit 2, 3-8 weeks&#xD;
      after after 3rd vaccination, vaccination reactions and clinical history will be assessed.&#xD;
      Blood (32ml - serology, T cell immunity) and saliva (1.5ml) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At vist 3,6 Month (Â±3 weeks) after 3rd vaccination, clinical history will be assessed. Blood&#xD;
      (8ml - serology) and saliva (1.5ml) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody tests and T cell assays will be performed according to protocol.&#xD;
