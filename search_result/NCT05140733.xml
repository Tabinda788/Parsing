  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was to see the effect of minimally invasive neural foraminotomy for lumbar&#xD;
      foraminal stenosis with unilateral radicular pain. Traditionally, fusion was was done for the&#xD;
      patients, but recent development enable surgeon to decompress neural foramen without rigid&#xD;
      spinal fusion. Although, clinical effect of neural foraminotomy may have limitation in&#xD;
      attaining a comparable result to fusion surgery, a cost-effective analysis may reveal a&#xD;
      result in a different perspective. In this regard, we designed a prospective cohort study to&#xD;
      see the cost-effectiveness of neural foraminotomy compared to fusion surgery.&#xD;

      Control: 1-2 levels fusion surgery Intervention: neural foraminotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion patients between 40 - 100 years. No improvement despite nonsurgical treatment for&#xD;
      more than 3 months. No history of lumbar fusion surgery Single or double-level lumbar&#xD;
      foraminal stenosis with corresponding leg pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Severe neurological deficit (motor grade less than Grade III) Combined inflammatory&#xD;
      joint disease Combined neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease or dementia&#xD;
      Combined cancer, traumatic fracture marked spinal deformity (C7 sagittal vertical axis &gt;&#xD;
      10cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery and follow-up Patients underwent foraminotomy and visits outpatient clinical at&#xD;
      determined time points (postoperative month 1, 6, 12 and 24 months) Their clinical outcomes&#xD;
      were recorded at each visit. Their medical costs were retrieved at the time of analysis by&#xD;
      using hospital records.&#xD;
