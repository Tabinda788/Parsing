      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy safety and tolerability of QR-421a&#xD;
      administered via intravitreal injection (IVT) in subjects with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) due&#xD;
      to mutations in exon 13 of the USH2A gene with advanced vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The below dose levels of QR-421a will be evaluated with the loading dose administered at Day&#xD;
      1 and maintenance dose administered at Month 3 and every 6 months thereafter:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Loading dose of 180 µg, maintenance dose of 60 µg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Loading dose of 60 µg, maintenance dose of 60 µg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose levels will include subjects randomized to sham-procedure or treatment with QR-421a.&#xD;
      After the study eye has been treated for at least 18 months, treatment of the fellow eye and&#xD;
      cross-over of subjects assigned to sham-procedure may be initiated in eligible eyes based on&#xD;
      assessment of benefit-risk.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. History of amblyopia in the study eye that resulted in significant vision loss, in the&#xD;

             cytostatics, interferons, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-binding proteins, drugs acting&#xD;
             on immunophilins, or antibodies with known impact on the immune system). Subjects that&#xD;

             first dose of study medication, whichever is longer, or plans to participate in&#xD;
             another study of an investigational drug or device during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any prior treatment with genetic or stem-cell therapy for ocular or non-ocular&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
