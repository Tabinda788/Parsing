  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by diminished&#xD;
      insulin secretion due to damage to islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, which eventually&#xD;
      results in high levels of glucose in the blood. According to World Diabetes Foundation, in&#xD;
      Palestine, 4.4% of diabetic patients are diagnosed with T1DM, while 95.3% are diagnosed with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (World Diabetes Foundation, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational studies have reliably provided evidence that T1DM patients with acceptable&#xD;
      glycemic control have higher 25(OH)D levels than T1DM with lesser glycemic control.&#xD;
      Additionally, it has been specified by some of the research-based studies that there is a&#xD;
      strong connection between the deficiency of vitamin D and the incidence of T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In interventional studies of T1DM children and adults, repletion of vitamin D in deficient&#xD;
      individuals improved HbA1c in a period of 12 weeks. Participants were more likely to achieve&#xD;
      HbA1c &lt; 7.8% if they had higher 25(OH)D levels on week 12 than on baseline, especially if&#xD;
      25(OH)D levels were exceeded 51 nmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), The Institute of Medicine's (IOM)&#xD;
      recommended Upper Limit (UL) for chronic Vitamin D intake for infants (children less than 1&#xD;
      year of age) is 25 mcg/day (1,000 IU/d), and for children age 1 year and older the&#xD;
      recommended UL is 50 mcg/day (2,000 IU/d) (Institute of Medicine Standing Committee on the&#xD;
      Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a large amount of evidence from observational and experimental studies supporting the&#xD;
      effects of vitamin D on glucose metabolism and the immune system, results from clinical&#xD;
      studies remain inconsistent, which makes it impossible to recommend vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      for the treatment of T1DM. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the status of vitamin D&#xD;
      among T1DM children for vitamin and to examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on&#xD;
      glycemic control in children with T1DM. This is the first randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
      studied the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control among T1DM children in&#xD;
      the Gaza Strip, Palestine.&#xD;

      2.1 Study design The study design was experimental, A randomized controlled trial. 2.2 Study&#xD;
      setting The study was conducted at the endocrinology outpatients' clinic at AL-RANTISI&#xD;
      PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL in Gaza Strip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Study Sample After getting the ethical approval, data were collected throughout 3 months,&#xD;
      starting from October 2017 to January 2018. In this period, 80 children who were less than 14&#xD;
      years old were diagnosed with T1DM which was indicated through fasting blood glucose level&#xD;
      greater than 126 mg/dl or HbA1c cut point of ≥6.5% (American Diabetes Association, 2010), and&#xD;
      had vitamin D deficiency which indicated by its levels of less than 12 ng/ml (Sullivan,&#xD;
      2019), were recruited from endocrinology outpatients' clinic at AL-RANTISI PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL&#xD;
      in Gaza Strip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified random sampling technique was applied to assign children with the previously&#xD;
      mentioned criteria into two groups. The first group is the interventional (experimental)&#xD;
      group that received vitamin D supplements (2000 IU/day) and the second group is the control&#xD;
      group that did not receive any supplements. Both groups were on their regular diet and&#xD;
      treatment, but one group was put on vitamin D supplement and the other group received a&#xD;
      placebo instead. According to previous studies and after the direct supervision from the&#xD;
      treating pediatrician and endocrinologist, the best preparation and dosage of vitamin D was&#xD;
      used (According to FDA the recommended dose for children age 1 year and older is 2,000&#xD;
      IU/day). The two groups were defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: is the control group, that received a placebo as a supplement. Group B: is the&#xD;
      interventional group that supplemented with vitamin D tablets containing 2000 IU once time&#xD;
      daily with a meal, for 3 months of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the laboratory investigations; vitamin D status was assessed by measuring the&#xD;
      concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the children's serum. Levels of 25(OH)D&#xD;
      were interpreted as deficiency (≤20 ng/ml or ≤50 nmol/L), insufficiency (21-29 ng/ml or&#xD;
      52.5-72.5 nmol/L), and sufficiency (30-100 ng/ml ng/ml or 75-250 nmol/L). The glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels are defined based on the control of diabetes, as good control (HbA1c&lt;7.8%),&#xD;
      moderate control (HbA1c:7.8%-9.9%), and poor control (HbA1c&gt;9.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Tools of Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's health assessment structure interview sheet was used to collect data. It was&#xD;
      constructed by the researchers based upon relevant literature. The questionnaire consisted of&#xD;
      three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Children's socio-demographic characteristics This part was aimed to collect&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics for both interventions, and control groups before the&#xD;
      intervention such as age, gender, number of family members, and level of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Children's current health history It covered the history of the discovery of&#xD;
      diabetes, duration of diabetes, type of insulin, family history of diabetes, and periodic&#xD;
      test for diabetes. This part had been used before the intervention for both the intervention&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III: Children's laboratory investigations This part addressed HbA1c that was&#xD;
      investigated and recorded before and after the interference for both interventions, and&#xD;
      control groups. Additionally, vitamin D status was assessed and recorded before the&#xD;
      intervention for both interventions, and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Statistical analysis Data was entered and statistically analyzed using a statistical&#xD;
      package for social sciences (SPSS) version 26 database for windows 10. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      were used to summarize the socio-demographic characteristics of subjects. Numerical data like&#xD;
      25-(OH)D levels, and HbA1c, were presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR) based on their&#xD;
      normality distribution. Categorical data were presented as frequency (percentage). The&#xD;
      chi-square test was used for categorical data comparison. Analysis of quantitative data&#xD;
      between two groups was done using unpaired t-test. Pearson correlation coefficients between&#xD;
      continuous variables were used as a measure of association. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
