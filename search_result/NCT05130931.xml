  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STC is considered one of the most prevalent peripheral neuropathy of the upper quadrant.&#xD;
      Systematic review shows that conservative treatment is effective for treatment of CTS. In&#xD;
      Spain, most patients diagnosed by CTS are included in surgery list without considering&#xD;
      conservative treatment as first option or providing drugs or night splint . However, surgical&#xD;
      treatment is not always necessary for these patients, and waiting list delays can lead to&#xD;
      aggravation of patients' symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researches believe that performing a conservative treatment including diacutaneous fibrolysis&#xD;
      on carpal tunnel syndrome patients, could reduce waiting surgery list, reduce the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness rate of the surgical process and improve patient's satisfaction and&#xD;
      clinical findings. In addition, patients of any level of severity and with systemic pathology&#xD;
      will be included to define which patients would benefit from surgical treatment and which&#xD;
      from physiotherapeutic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to find out the impact of a physiotherapy treatment consisting of the application&#xD;
      of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis on the forearm, wrist and hand in patients with Carpal Tunnel&#xD;
      Syndrome (CTS) on the patient and the Aragonese Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled clinical trial will be performed. First a pilot study will be carried&#xD;
      out. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome included on waiting surgery list of Miguel Servet&#xD;
      Hospital will be recruited. They will be randomized into a control group (staying in waiting&#xD;
      list and performing healthcare standard) and into an experimental group (3 sessions of 45 min&#xD;
      of diacutaneous fibrolysis and homebased treatment). Different outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      pre-treatment, at the end of treatment, 3 and 6 months later.&#xD;
