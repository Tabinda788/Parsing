  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with ASD and intellectual disability (ID) are a complex and underserved&#xD;
      population. Approximately 50% of individuals with ASD/ID experience significant anxiety. Yet,&#xD;
      there are very limited mental health care interventions available for this population.&#xD;
      Addressing anxiety and building coping skills is particularly important during adolescence as&#xD;
      coping skills can support a successful transition to adulthood and family functioning during&#xD;
      a difficult developmental period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current investigators adapted a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) manualized&#xD;
      intervention, Facing Your Fears, for adolescents with ASD/ID (FYF:ASD/ID) and completed a&#xD;
      pilot study with 23 teens. Preliminary results indicated significant improvements in anxiety&#xD;
      and mood symptoms. The proposed study seeks to test whether FYF:ASD/ID is more effective in&#xD;
      reducing anxiety than treatment-as-usual (TAU). The investigators propose a Randomized&#xD;
      Control Trial (RCT) with 36 adolescents with ASD/ID (12-18 years) randomized to FYF: ASD/ID&#xD;
      and 36 adolescents randomized to TAU for 14 weeks. The 36 teens randomized to TAU will then&#xD;
      cross-over and complete FYF:ASD/ID. Evaluations will take place at Baseline,&#xD;
      Post-Intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Teens in the TAU will have two baseline assessments&#xD;
      prior to crossing over to FYF:ASD/ID; both groups will complete a 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessment after finishing FYF:ASD/ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three aims for this project: (1) examine the efficacy of FYF: ASD/ID relative to&#xD;
      TAU in improving anxiety as measured by parent report and determine if any gains noted in the&#xD;
      FYF:ASD/ID are maintained at 6-month follow-up; (2) examine secondary outcomes of anxiety&#xD;
      such as how emotion regulation and problem behavior are affected by participation in&#xD;
      FYF:ASD/ID; and (3) examine whether adolescents' independent use of CBT skills (as assessed&#xD;
      by goal attainment ratings of prompting level required to use strategies) to manage anxiety&#xD;
      are increased following participation in FYF:ASD/ID.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Adolescents with ASD and intellectual disability (ID) are a complex and&#xD;
      under-served population. Anxiety occurs at higher rates in individuals with ASD/ID (53%) than&#xD;
      in ID alone (17%) and may result in physical distress, avoidance of stressful situations, and&#xD;
      problem behavior. Further, it frequently contributes to caregivers &quot;taking over&quot; tasks for&#xD;
      youth with ID and limiting independence. Parents voice concern about treatment options as the&#xD;
      limited available supports often focus on prevention and accommodation of anxiety, rather&#xD;
      than on building coping skills. Thus, teens often finish high school with limited coping&#xD;
      abilities and consequently experience heightened anxiety in the workplace and poor job&#xD;
      retention. Yet, when coping skills are taught early in adolescence, there is an opportunity&#xD;
      to practice coping prior to transition, leading to better employment rates, decreased&#xD;
      clinical service use, and increased long-term wages. Addressing anxiety and building coping&#xD;
      skills for teens with ASD/ID is of critical importance as these are per-requisite skills for&#xD;
      successful transition to adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A significant treatment barrier for teens with ASD/ID is the lack of evidence&#xD;
      based, manualized interventions for this population. This is due, in part, because youth with&#xD;
      ASD/ID have typically been excluded from intervention research trials examining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of best practice treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Recent&#xD;
      research adapting CBT to meet the cognitive, social, and behavioral needs of this population&#xD;
      have yielded promising results and challenge the paradigm that individuals with ID are not&#xD;
      able to access cognitive and emotion regulation strategies. The research team for the present&#xD;
      study adapted a CBT manualized intervention, Facing Your Fears, for adolescents with ASD/ID&#xD;
      (FYF:ASD/ID) and completed a pilot study with 23 teens. Preliminary outcome measures&#xD;
      indicated significant improvements in anxiety and mood symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The current study seeks to test whether FYF:ASD/ID, an adapted CBT intervention&#xD;
      for teens with ASD/ID, is more effective in reducing anxiety than treatment-as-usual (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The investigators will use a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with 36 adolescents&#xD;
      with ASD/ID (12-18 years) randomized to FYF: ASD/ID and 36 adolescents randomized to TAU for&#xD;
      14 weeks. The 36 teens randomized to TAU will then cross-over and complete FYF:ASD/ID.&#xD;
      Evaluations will take place at Baseline, Post-Intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Teens in&#xD;
      the TAU will have two baseline assessments prior to crossing over to FYF:ASD/ID; both groups&#xD;
      will complete a 6-month follow-up assessment after finishing FYF:ASD/ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Three aims are proposed: (1) examine the efficacy of FYF: ASD/ID relative to&#xD;
      TAU in improving anxiety as measured by parent report and determine if gains are maintained&#xD;
      at 6-month follow-up; (2) examine secondary outcomes of anxiety such as how emotion&#xD;
      regulation and problem behavior are affected by participation in FYF:ASD/ID; and (3) examine&#xD;
      whether adolescents' independent use of CBT skills (as assessed by goal attainment ratings of&#xD;
      prompting level required to use strategies) to manage anxiety are increased following&#xD;
      participation in FYF:ASD/ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: The present study would represent the first RCT of a CBT intervention for adolescents&#xD;
      with ASD/ID, a critical step toward establishing an evidence base for anxiety treatment for&#xD;
      this underserved and vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translatability: It is necessary to close the gap in the availability of anxiety&#xD;
      interventions and ensure effective mental health care for all individuals on the spectrum.&#xD;
      Completing a well-designed RCT that incorporates random assignment, a control group, and&#xD;
      careful measurement of anxiety is a critical next step in evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      this CBT treatment and supporting the study of interventions that can contribute to positive&#xD;
      coping skills that allow teens to access time limited transition services and optimize&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in number of anxiety diagnoses as measured by the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Autism Addendum (ADIS:ASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (i.e., within 6 weeks' start of the treatment or TAU condition), Post treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the completion of the14-week treatment or TAU condition), and follow-up (six months following the completion of the treatment condition)</time_frame>
    <description>The ADIS:ASA is a semi-structured clinical interview completed with a parent that assesses anxiety diagnoses in children and adolescents with ASD. This measure provides a total number of anxiety diagnoses for a child. The interview will be administered and anxiety diagnoses recorded at the following time points: Baseline (i.e., within 6 weeks' start of the treatment or TA condition), Post treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the completion of the14-week treatment or TAU condition), and follow-up (six months following the completion of the treatment condition). Change in the total number of anxiety diagnoses that a child meets diagnostic criteria for on the ADIS:ASA will be calculated across the aforementioned time points.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Clinical Global Improvement-Severity score as derived by the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Autism Addendum (ADIS:ASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (i.e., within 6 weeks' start of the treatment or TAU condition), Post treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the completion of the14-week treatment or TAU condition), and follow-up (six months following the completion of the treatment condition)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Improvement-severity (CGI-S) scores are derived from the ADIS:ASA. The CGI-S is a summary rating (i.e., likert scale of 1 to 7 with 7 indicating very severe) indicating the extent to which the teen's anxiety symptoms assessed via the ADIS:ASA impact daily functioning. To calculate change in anxiety severity, the CGI-S ratings are calculated at baseline (i.e., 6 weeks prior to the start of the 14-week TAU condition of intervention condition), post-treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the end of the completion of the 14-week TAU condition and intervention group conditions) and at follow-up (i.e., 6 months following the completion of the 14-week TAU intervention group). Change in CGI-S ratings across these time points are calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Reactivity subscale as assessed by the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (i.e., within 6 weeks' start of the treatment or TAU condition), Post treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the completion of the14-week treatment or TAU condition), and follow-up (six months following the completion of the treatment condition)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDI is a parent report measure of emotion dysregulation in youth with ASD. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very severe). The Reactivity sub-scale contains 7-items. Possible scores on the Reactivity sub-scale could range from 7 to 35, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. To calculate change in Reactivity the total score on the sub-scale is calculated at baseline (i.e., 6 weeks prior to the start of the 14-week TAU condition of intervention condition), post-treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the end of the completion of the 14-week TAU condition and intervention group conditions) and at follow-up (i.e., 6 months following the completion of the 14-week TAU intervention group).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Dysphoria subscale as assessed by the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (i.e., within 6 weeks' start of the treatment or TAU condition), Post treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the completion of the14-week treatment or TAU condition), and follow-up (six months following the completion of the treatment condition)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDI is a parent report measure of emotion dysregulation in youth with ASD. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very severe). The Dysphoria subscale contains 6-items. Possible scores on the Reactivity subscale could range from 6 to 30, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. To assess change in Dysphoria, the total score on the Dysphoria subscale is calculated at baseline (i.e., 6 weeks prior to the start of the 14-week TAU condition of intervention condition), post-treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the end of the completion of the 14-week TAU condition and intervention group conditions) and at follow-up (i.e., 6 months following the completion of the 14-week TAU intervention group). Change is assessed across these time points.</description>

    <measure>Change in problem behavior as assessed by the The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (i.e., within 6 weeks' start of the treatment or TAU condition), Post treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the completion of the14-week treatment or TAU condition), and follow-up (six months following the completion of the treatment condition)</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC-C is a 58-item parent report questionnaire that evaluates the presence and severity of problem behavior across five sub-scales: Irritability, Lethargy/Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity/Noncompliance sub-scales, and Inappropriate Speech. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-3 with 0 being &quot;not at all a problem&quot; and 3 being &quot;the problem is severe in degree.&quot; Total problem behavior raw scores across the five sub-scales range from 0-174.To assess change in problem behavior, the total raw score is calculated at baseline (i.e., 6 weeks prior to the start of the 14-week TAU condition of intervention condition), post-treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the end of the completion of the 14-week TAU condition and intervention group conditions) and at follow-up (i.e., 6 months following the completion of the 14-week TAU intervention group). Change is assessed across these time points.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory Aim: Exploratory analyses will be conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment participation on teens' independent use of somatic management, emotion regulation, and cognitive strategies using goal attainment scaling (e.g., GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (i.e., within 6 weeks' start of the treatment or TAU condition), Post treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the completion of the14-week treatment or TAU condition), and follow-up (six months following the completion of the treatment condition)</time_frame>
    <description>Teens use of somatic management, emotion regulation and cognitive strategies is assessed by a clinician via the CBT goal attainment scale interview. Scores from 0-4 are established for each participant based on outlined criteria for strategy use (0 indicates extremely limit skills and high dependence on others to use skills, 4 indicates independent use of skills, low dependence on others to use skills). Ratings are calculated at baseline (i.e., 6 weeks prior to the start of the 14-week TAU condition of intervention condition), post-treatment (i.e., within 6 weeks of the end of the completion of the 14-week TAU condition and intervention group conditions) and at follow-up (i.e., 6 months following the completion of the 14-week TAU intervention group). Change is assessed across these time points. Within-subject changes from baseline to post-treatment and follow-up on GAS will be evaluated using mixed model analyses.</description>
