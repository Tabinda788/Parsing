  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study addressing the incidence of cerebral microemboli and&#xD;
      alterations of cerebral hemodynamic physiology of the Relay速Branch thoracic stent-graft&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective multi-center observational study. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in RelayBranch (NCT03214601). Participating centers must have capabilities of&#xD;
      performing intra-operative TCD monitoring and post-operative TCD monitoring. If sites have&#xD;
      performed TCD microembolic monitoring during previous RelayBranch procedures, we will also&#xD;
      incorporate these data in our analysis. The primary objective is to assess the number and&#xD;
      timing of cerebral microemboli during Relay速Branch thoracic stent-graft deployment, to&#xD;
      identify the highest risk portions of the procedure. Secondary objectives include: correlate&#xD;
      procedural microembolic burden with neuroimaging and clinical outcome; quantify&#xD;
      post-operative microemboli, correlating with neuroimaging and clinical outcome; and quantify&#xD;
      the changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral autoregulation that happens during critical&#xD;
      procedural epochs, correlating with neuroimaging and clinical outcome.&#xD;

    <description>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive ultrasound-based technique that facilitates insonation of the cerebral arteries. TCD probe design enables continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv). TCD has a variety of clinical applications, including intraoperative monitoring for detection of microemboli. The TCD probe can be comfortably secured to the patient's head by a headframe in order to maintain continuous vessel insonation. Microembolic signals (MES) can be reliably detected based on standard criteria:&#xD;
Brief in duration (&lt;300msec)&#xD;
High intensity (amplitude &gt;3 dB above background)&#xD;
Unidirectional&#xD;
Audible chirp or snap&#xD;
Further, CBFv monitoring during may inform flow perturbations that occur during cardiac or vascular manipulations.</description>

        20 subjects will be enrolled at multiple participating centers. All eligible subjects will&#xD;
        be identified based on enrollment in RelayBranch (NCT03214601) or in their hum. We&#xD;
        anticipate enrollment will be complete within 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrollment in NCT03214601 based on presence of a thoracic aortic aneurysm, penetrating&#xD;
             atherosclerotic ulcer, or chronic type B dissection that would require coverage of the&#xD;
             brachiocephalic trunk and/or left carotid if a non-branching endograft were implanted&#xD;
             Advanced heart failure with plan to treat with LVAD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled prospectively must sign the informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients underwent TCD monitoring during a previous RelayBranch procedure as part&#xD;
             of routine clinical care, we will also incorporate their data in our analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skull defect or skull surgery that will preclude monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known lack of TCD temporal acoustic window (if had TCD in past)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected surgical position will preclude access to the patient's head for monitoring&#xD;
