      Methods: the medical records and chest high-resolution CT images of patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      interstitial pneumonia admitted to the respiratory department of the Third Hospital of Peking&#xD;
      University from June 1, 2012 to December 31, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.Application&#xD;
      of artificial intelligence deep learning neural convolution network method to create&#xD;
      recognition technology of different imaging features.Including ground glass, mesh, honeycomb,&#xD;
      nodule or consolidation, the model was established. IIP patients were divided into hormone&#xD;
      sensitive group and hormone insensitive group according to whether the use of hormone was&#xD;
      effective or not.Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the correlation between&#xD;
      statistically significant parameters and hormone sensitivity.Artificial intelligence was used&#xD;
      to establish the correlation model between imaging features and clinical data and hormone&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;

    <description>The U-net method of deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to create the recognition model of different imaging features. Imaging features include ground-glass opacity, reticulation, honeycomb and consolidation. With the area ratio of imaging features of the two groups as the input and hormone efficacy as the output, the correlation model between imaging features and hormone sensitivity was established by using artificial intelligence k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.</description>
