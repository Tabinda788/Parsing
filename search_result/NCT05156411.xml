      The new training device, the eccentric arm-crank, will be examined for its training effect by&#xD;
      this project. That the training device can be used in athletes and patients with paraplegia&#xD;
      in the future, the so-called &quot;testing of the applicability of this concept&quot; will be carried&#xD;
      out during this study. Fourteen volunteer, healthy and trained people are first tested for&#xD;
      their upper body performance, followed by a training phase over 20 trainings and at the and&#xD;
      the performance data is collected again. The training intensity and duration is continuously&#xD;
      increased during the training phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the beginning, the study design includes an familiarisation appointment with performance&#xD;
      tests and training on the eccentric arm-crank device (KREHA). At least one week later, the&#xD;
      first test sequence including a maximum strength test (bench press), magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) to determine the muscle cross-section area of the upper arm and a test to&#xD;
      determine the anaerobic performance (Wingate test) is conducted. The second test sequence&#xD;
      takes place one to three days later. This includes a handgrip strength test, an aerobic&#xD;
      endurance test (ramp test on the arm crank ergometer with ergospirometry) and a further&#xD;
      familiarisation training on the KREHA. The training phase starts within two weeks after the&#xD;
      pre-tests have been completed. There are two to a maximum of three trainings per week. These&#xD;
      take 30 to 60 minutes and take place on the KREHA device under the supervision of the study&#xD;
      staff. The training phase lasts a maximum of twelve weeks (20 training sessions). The first&#xD;
      test sequence is repeated five to eight days after the last workout. The second test sequence&#xD;
      takes place at the same time interval as in the pre-tests.&#xD;

    <description>Over the twenty training sessions, able-bodied participants will exercise on the KREHA device. An arm-crank has to be decelerated, which will be rotated by a prematurely defined revolution rate and training duration. During this intervention a certain power has to be applied. During the whole time of training a continous progression in power and training duration is applied</description>
