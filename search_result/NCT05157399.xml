  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular disorders are among the most common causes of disability in society and affect&#xD;
      over 50% of the population over the age of 65 and a significant percentage of the younger&#xD;
      population. Vestibular disorders have a dramatic impact on daily life impacting work,&#xD;
      relationships, and even activities of daily living.The OtoBand has shown promise and might be&#xD;
      beneficial for treating or improving the course of recovery from vestibular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to quantify the effect of the study device, the OtoBand, on objective&#xD;
      measures of dizziness and vertigo in patients with vestibular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at a single-site and will be a blinded, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled design in which participants do not know if they are receiving bone&#xD;
      conducted stimulation 1) at a therapeutic level or 2) at a non therapeutic level.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vestibular disorders are among the most common causes of disability in society and affect&#xD;
      over 50% of the population over the age of 65 and a significant percentage of the younger&#xD;
      population. Vestibular disorders have a dramatic impact on daily life impacting work,&#xD;
      relationships, and even activities of daily living. At the current time, the mainstay of&#xD;
      therapy for many vestibular disorders is a physical therapy called vestibular rehabilitation.&#xD;
      While usually highly effective, this therapy is time consuming and not universally effective,&#xD;
      in part because of inconsistent subject compliance. The use of adjuvant devices to speed&#xD;
      recovery has been studied but very few devices have proved beneficial; the few that have&#xD;
      shown benefit only work in special populations and are large units that cost several million&#xD;
      dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will assay the efficacy of the OtoBand in participants with&#xD;
      vertigo and dizziness. The OtoBand will be given to participants with vertigo and dizziness&#xD;
      in patients with vestibular dysfunction. Participants will be recruited from patients who&#xD;
      present at the Dizziness and Vertigo Institute of Los Angeles and for whom the Principal&#xD;
      Investigators recommend a course of vestibular rehabilitation therapy. The OtoBand will be&#xD;
      set at either a normal power (effective) or low power (lower than the power level thought to&#xD;
      be effective, placebo device). Participants will not know if they are receiving receiving&#xD;
      bone conducted stimulation 1) at a therapeutic level or 2) at a non therapeutic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to determine if, in patients going to the Dizzy and Vertigo Institute of Los&#xD;
      Angeles for vestibular rehabilitation therapy, objective measures of dizziness and vertigo&#xD;
      are significantly changed by wearing the OtoBand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential changes will be measured in the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sinusoidal Harmonic Acceleration (SHA), also known as rotary chair test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spontaneous Nystagmus&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current protocol, three conditions (sham, therapeutic and no device) will be tested&#xD;
      within an hour in a randomized sequence, with the OtoBand remaining in place throughout&#xD;
      (turned off in the &quot;no device&quot; condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the change(s) induced by the OtoBand in&#xD;
      objective measures of vestibular symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant's questionnaire as to which level the participant believes they used first&#xD;
           and second (sham setting vs therapeutic setting);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure whether Migraine and Vestibulopathy patients experience higher benefits from a&#xD;
           given power level as measured by objective tests (SVV, SHAs and spontaneous nystagmus);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure whether Migraine and Vestibulopathy patients experience any benefit from the&#xD;
           placebo setting.&#xD;
