  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness- and&#xD;
      acceptance-based smartphone app (MABSA) intervention for frontline nurses emotionally and&#xD;
      psychologically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study will use a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial design of two groups: intervention group of about 30 participants with posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress symptoms and wait-list control group of about 30 participants. The duration of the&#xD;
      MABSA intervention is 6 weeks. The following are the outcomes to be measured: resilience,&#xD;
      PTSD, mindfulness, experiential avoidance, and rumination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of the&#xD;
      Mindfulness/Acceptance-Based Smartphone App (MABSA) intervention in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) environment and to obtain generalized information (i.e., initial efficacy,&#xD;
      recruitment, retention, adherence, satisfaction, and usability of the refined intervention).&#xD;
      The expected results will provide the foundation for a prospective, fully powered,&#xD;
      larger-scale RCT study. We previously developed the MABSA and pilot tested it in a single-arm&#xD;
      study among veterans, and we will be testing the app among nurses who have been emotionally&#xD;
      and psychologically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our central hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      refined MABSA intervention would improve intervention satisfaction, app usability, and&#xD;
      adherence and positively affect resilience, PTSD, mindfulness, experiential avoidance, and&#xD;
      rumination. The specific aims of the proposed study are outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To refine the previously developed MABSA intervention. The 6-week smartphone-delivered&#xD;
      program will involve (1) daily audio-guided meditations on various mindfulness and acceptance&#xD;
      exercises constructed based on the principles of acceptance and commitment therapy; (2)&#xD;
      weekly support and feedback through phone calls and/or texting the intervention facilitators;&#xD;
      and (3) ecological momentary assessment (daily monitoring of PTSD and resilience) to monitor&#xD;
      the progression of treatment response (i.e., the trajectory of resilience and PTSD recovery).&#xD;
      We will obtain qualitative feedback on program content and format through a pilot test of the&#xD;
      prototype with a group of eligible nurses (N = 4). Upon revising the intervention based on&#xD;
      participants' feedback, we will develop the intervention protocol manual for the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To test the feasibility and acceptability of the refined MABSA intervention in a&#xD;
      small-scale RCT for a prospective, fully powered, larger-scale RCT study. The small-scale RCT&#xD;
      study will involve the following two groups of frontline nurses: (1) the MABSA intervention&#xD;
      group (N = 30) and the waitlist control group (N = 30). Upon collecting the data on&#xD;
      recruitment, retention, adherence, intervention satisfaction, and app usability, we will&#xD;
      determine the preliminary efficacy based on the following five outcomes: resilience, PTSD,&#xD;
      mindfulness, experiential avoidance, and rumination. Qualitative feedback on the facilitators&#xD;
      of and challenges to recruitment, retention, and adherence will be collected via exit&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
