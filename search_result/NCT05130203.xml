  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residents living in long-term care (LTC) homes spend up to 75% of their day in sedentary,&#xD;
      socially withdrawn situations which increases their risk for depression, dementia, decreased&#xD;
      functional status and increased care costs. Physical activity is an accepted intervention to&#xD;
      improve the physical health, cognition, and well-being of older adults. Moreover, systematic&#xD;
      reviews have found that exergaming (i.e. physical activity gamified with technology) offers&#xD;
      physical, cognitive, and social benefits by means of dual-task activities that engage both&#xD;
      motor and cognitive abilities. The effect of exergaming for older adults in LTC is less&#xD;
      clear, as this population has greater health needs related to physical health conditions,&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, and functional dependence. Given the increased global demand for LTC,&#xD;
      there is a need to develop and assess innovative exergaming technologies that can support the&#xD;
      physical and cognitive health of LTC residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MouvMat is an exergaming technology intervention with an interactive digital gaming surface&#xD;
      designed for older adults (OA) in LTC settings. They can play familiar games, like Simon or&#xD;
      Bingo, by stepping on or tapping the surface with an assistive pointing device. Games can be&#xD;
      played individually or with multiple players. LED lights on the surface provide an adaptive&#xD;
      digital display and embedded pressure sensors respond to players' input. The investigators&#xD;
      collaboratively designed a preliminary prototype with OA aged 65 and older in a pilot&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this proposal is to conduct a pilot RCT of the Mouvmat to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of the exergaming technology to improve the&#xD;
      primary outcome of mobility, and the secondary outcomes of cognitive function and social&#xD;
      isolation compared to a usual care control group receiving standard recreational programming&#xD;
      by recreational therapists.&#xD;

      Our sample size calculation was completed based on an effect size of 0.65 (power = 0.80;&#xD;
      2-tailed; Î±= 0.05). Assuming a 10% attrition rate, we will recruit a total of 60 residents&#xD;
      (30 people in a control group and 30 people in the intervention group). A block randomization&#xD;
      design with sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes to conceal the randomization&#xD;
      sequence will be used to assign participants to groups. We will attempt to recruit equal&#xD;
      numbers of men and women with a range of mobility requirements (i.e., ambulate independently,&#xD;
      using gait aids such as canes or walkers). In addition, a mix of approximately 6-10 LTC staff&#xD;
      and resident family members will be recruited at the end of the trial to conduct&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews to understand the acceptability of the technology, design,&#xD;
      usability and enjoyment, potential facilitators and barriers to exergame technology.&#xD;
