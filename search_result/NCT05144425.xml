  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to determine whether the use of a tourniquet during TKA would affect&#xD;
      total measured blood loss , operation time, postoperative complications; hemoglobin&#xD;
      concentration; limb swelling and postoperative pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourniquets are widely used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) . TKA has been reported to be&#xD;
      associated with significant blood loss which at times necessitates transfusion. Although the&#xD;
      tourniquet is widely used by orthopedic surgeons, its role is controversial . Several studies&#xD;
      have shown that using a tourniquet in TKA could reduce the total blood loss, while results&#xD;
      from others indicated the opposite . Therefore the relationship between the use of a&#xD;
      tourniquet and the total blood loss of patients undergoing TKA is still unclear. The use of a&#xD;
      tourniquet is believed to be effective for decreasing intraoperative blood loss and creating&#xD;
      a bloodless surgical field, which theoretically would facilitate the cementing technique and&#xD;
      other surgical procedures. However, reactive blood flow reaches its peak within five minutes&#xD;
      after the tourniquet has been released Complications reported as a consequence of tourniquet&#xD;
      application are skin injury [skin abrasions, blisters, breaks , pressure necrosis], nerve&#xD;
      injury, post tourniquet syndrome, Deep venous thrombosis, Postoperative pain, wound healing&#xD;
      disorders and early infections&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>post operative pain measured on VAS after TKA with and without using tourniquet</measure>
    <time_frame>48hr</time_frame>
    <description>Knee joint pain will be measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) (range, 0-10) pre-operatively and on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 14th postoperative days [12]. A higher score on the VAS equates to a higher level of pain.</description>

    <description>Hemoglobin level will be measured pre-operatively and after 24hrs and 48 hrs post-operatively. Patients with Hb &lt; 8 g/dl or those who have exhibited symptoms of acute anemia will receive blood transfusion therapy. The amount of blood transfused will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The randomization will be performed by a research fellow who will not be involved in patient care. All of the operations will be performed through the medial parapatellar approach by experienced knee surgeons. Drainage system will be used for 48 hours postoperative. In the tourniquet group, the tourniquet will be inflated to a pressure of systolic blood pressure plus 100 mm Hg and will be released after the joint capsule has been closed. hemostasis and then will be wrapped with elastic bandages. In the non-tourniquet group, the tourniquet will be wrapped around the thigh but will not be inflated during the surgery. The criterion for a blood transfusion will set as a hemoglobin (Hb) level of&lt;8 g/dL or patient with symptomatic anemia.</description>
