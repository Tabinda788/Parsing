  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a major health problem across the United States, with socio-economic burden,&#xD;
      major cause of disability, and poor quality of life. One such non-pharmacologic treatment is&#xD;
      Self-Natural Posture Exercise (SNPE), a series of exercise programs developed in conjunction&#xD;
      with orthodontic bracing principles. Belts are worn around the hips (pelvic correction belt)&#xD;
      and legs (right posture belt) to assist with self-directed exercise and posture correction. A&#xD;
      typical SNPE program has eight different movements, targeting the entire axial skeleton. The&#xD;
      exercises can be practiced anywhere and are widely applicable to patients as exercises are&#xD;
      low- to moderate-intensity flexibility-based muscle strength training. There are several&#xD;
      studies from Korea examining the efficacy of SNPE; however, there are few English language&#xD;
      studies and there are no studies from outside the country of South Korea. As such, there is&#xD;
      little data the generalizability of SNPE, the degree of cultural acceptance in other&#xD;
      countries, and the all-important adherence to the home exercise program. The present study&#xD;
      proposes to be the first study outside of South Korea to examine the effects of SNPE on&#xD;
      chronic low back patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study seeks to repeat the previously described positive clinical impact of SNPE&#xD;
      in a new population, examine rates of adherence, and compare the effects of face-to-face&#xD;
      versus online courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aim 1: Investigate the adherence to an SNPE program in American adults to explore the&#xD;
           generalizability of existing Korean data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim 2: Assess the effects of a 12-week face-to-face vs online SNPE program on back pain.&#xD;
           We hypothesize that the face-to-face group will show greater pain reduction and&#xD;
           improvements in body posture and quality of life compared to the control group after&#xD;
           phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aim 3: Compare adherence to and effects of face-to-face vs online 12-week SNPE programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aim 4: Investigate the adherence to and effects of face-to-face vs online 12-week SNPE&#xD;
           programs at a follow-up of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a wait-list control group will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate the effect of SNPE for back pain reduction. The control group will&#xD;
      receive online SNPE intervention after serving as an untreated comparison group. The&#xD;
      wait-list control group serves two purposes. First, it provides an untreated comparison for&#xD;
      the face-to-face group to determine if the intervention had an effect. By serving as a&#xD;
      comparison group, researchers are able to isolate the independent variable and look at the&#xD;
      impact it had. Second, it allows the wait-listed participants an opportunity to obtain the&#xD;
      intervention at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flyers, Billings Clinic employee emails, and social media will be used to recruit&#xD;
      participants. Recruitment messages will include relevant information about the study,&#xD;
      benefits, and inclusion criteria as well as a link to a study-specific website recapitulating&#xD;
      this information (https://xppizim.wixsite.com/snpestudy). When patients contact the&#xD;
      investigators, any questions will be answered. If the patient chooses to go forward, the ODI&#xD;
      Questionnaire and Self-reported Data Form will be collected online (www.surveymonkey.com).&#xD;
      Data will be reviewed for eligibility, and if appropriate, participant will be sent the&#xD;
      information contained on the consent form to review; the actual signed form will be collected&#xD;
      at time of their 1st assessment prior to the collection of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being assessed by a physiatrist, eligible participants will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study. All participants will have an equal chance of being randomly assigned (using a&#xD;
      random number table from Microsoft Excel to produce random numbers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be exported from www.surveymonkey.com and analyzed using the Statistical&#xD;
      Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) application. Descriptive statistics will be used to&#xD;
      summarize demographic variables. To investigate adherence mentioned in Aim 1 and 4,&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages will be analyzed for categorical variables and mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, quartiles, and ranges for continuous variables. For Aim 2 and 3, all outcome&#xD;
      measures will be compared between groups (Assessment 1 will be considered the baseline for&#xD;
      FTF and Assessment 2 will be the baseline for ONL), will be analyzed using an analysis of&#xD;
      covariance (ANCOVA) via the General Linear Model (GLM). Age and gender will be controlled as&#xD;
      covariates. If there is a significant difference using ANCOVA, we will follow up with post&#xD;
      hoc testing.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean change from baseline muscle tone (measured by Myoton Pro device, in Hz) at week 0, 12, 24, and 36</measure>
    <time_frame>Specific metric will be gathered at outset of study and then after a 12 week intervention. It will be gathered again 12 weeks further out (24 weeks from outset). It will be gathered again 12 weeks further out (36 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle tone is a biomechanical characteristic of a muscle and is measured as the muscle's natural vibration in a stable state without voluntary muscle contraction. This is expressed in frequency (㎐), and the higher the value, the higher the muscle tension. Muscle tone will be measured using a non-invasive muscle tone meter developed for objective quantification of the mechanical properties of muscles.</description>
