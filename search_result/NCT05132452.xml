  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to gather more information regarding two clinically relevant tests: The Test&#xD;
      of Mastication and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS) and the Timed Water Swallow Test (TWST). Both&#xD;
      tests can be used clinically as part of swallowing disorders evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study were to assess the reliability of the two tests, to document the&#xD;
      effects of age and gender on the outcome measures of the TOMASS and TWST and to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between participants' function in the two tests. To do that, 298 healthy&#xD;
      participants were included. All of them did not have dysphagia. Most of them were elderly.&#xD;

      Background: Quantitative measures of swallowing function can increase accuracy, reliability,&#xD;
      and improve clinical decision making. The Test of Mastication and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS)&#xD;
      and the Timed Water Swallow Test (TWST) are functional tests of swallowing that provide&#xD;
      quantitative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To explore the relationship between TOMASS and TWST; evaluate test-retest and&#xD;
      interrater reliability; explore age and gender effects; and to gather normative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Healthy community dwelling participants (n = 298, â‰¥20 years old) were recruited. Of&#xD;
      those, 126 were included in the reliability study. Participants completed the TWST and&#xD;
      TOMASS.&#xD;
