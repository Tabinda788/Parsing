  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two of the most common nutritional deficiencies are anemia and zinc deficiency. One strategy&#xD;
      for combating nutritional deficiencies is biofortification. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      proposed research is to determine in humans the bioavailability of iron and zinc from&#xD;
      biofortified potatoes as compared to a non-fortified local variety. The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to use the data obtained from the human studies to model the potential impact of the&#xD;
      introduction of biofortified potatoes to the alleviation of iron and zinc deficiencies in the&#xD;
      Andean Highlands and low and middle-income countries elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron bioavailability studies: The investigators will compare bioavailability of iron from a&#xD;
      non-fortified potato variety with a biofortified potato that has significantly higher iron&#xD;
      content though the use of a randomized cross-over intervention study. Female volunteers will&#xD;
      consume both biofortified potato extrinsically labelled with 58FeSO4 and a nonfortified&#xD;
      potato labelled with 57FeSO4. Thirty women with marginal iron status (plasma ferritin &lt; 25&#xD;
      ng/ml) will be selected from an initial screening of 180 women. Every woman will receive 2&#xD;
      different types of test meals in a series of 20 servings for 10 days each. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected during screening and on days 1, 15, 26 and 40 and the amount of 58Fe and 57Fe&#xD;
      incorporated into hemoglobin and serum ferritin quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc bioavailability study: The investigators will compare bioavailability of zinc from a&#xD;
      non-fortified potato variety with that of a biofortified potato that has significantly higher&#xD;
      zinc content (p&lt;0.001) with a crossover study. Forty volunteers will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive first either the biofortified or the non-fortified potato and receive the second meal&#xD;
      30 days later. Zinc absorption from two meals will be measured using the double stable&#xD;
      isotope technique. Every volunteer will be given an i.v. infusion of 70zinc and two test&#xD;
      meals of 250 g cooked potato labelled extrinsically with 67zinc separated by 3-4 hr. A spot&#xD;
      urine sample will be collected 96 hours after each set of test meal and the ratio of the two&#xD;
      isotopes measured to calculate absorption of zinc from the test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modelling and Impact assessment: Data on bioavailability will be used in a Disability&#xD;
      Adjusted Life Year model to assess the potential impact of biofortified potatoes to alleviate&#xD;
      iron and zinc deficiencies in the Andean Highlands and low and middle-income countries&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;

      Type of Study and population Double blind randomized trial of naturally biofortified potatoes&#xD;
      to be carried out in Huancavelica, Per√∫. It will be recruited about 100 women and 80 men aged&#xD;
      18-45 years living in the city of Huancavelica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS Applications was submitted and approved by Research Ethics Committee (REC) of the&#xD;
      University of East Anglia Faculty of Medicine and Health (FMH) in Norwich (UK) and a REC of&#xD;
      the Instituto de Investigacion Nutricional (IIN) in Peru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will be fully informed of all the procedures and will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions and receive any further details participants require.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures (blood samples, urine samples, anthropometry, dietary recall) will be&#xD;
      explained to the individuals who agree to take part in the initial screening, and&#xD;
      participants will be invited to sign the first consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC METHODS FOR IRON STUDY (Phase 1) Sample size The study requires an enrollment of a&#xD;
      total of 30 women to allow for 33% who do not adhere to the protocol, to reach a final sample&#xD;
      size of 20 women. The investigators estimate that the investigators may need to screen about&#xD;
      100 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional Status As part of the screening all the potential candidates will be weighed and&#xD;
      measured using standardized equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of physical activity All the participants will be asked to use an actigraph (a&#xD;
      tri-axial accelerometer) which measures physical activity (movement) in three dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample An appropriately trained member of the study team will collect a venous blood&#xD;
      sample (approximately 6ml in a test tube with heparin) to measure ferritin, hemoglobin, and&#xD;
      CRP (screening and 3 more times: baseline, 16 and 40 days after first day of potato intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample Participants will be asked to provide a urine sample (30ml) to carry out a&#xD;
      pregnancy test using a test strip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and Food security survey The investigators will include a socioeconomic&#xD;
      survey and the ELCSA food security questionnaire both will be applied to all enrolled&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures According to the results of the screening and revision of the criteria for&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion and following information and verification that participants&#xD;
      understand the iron study consent form, subjects will be invited to participate. Consented&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to consume one or other of the two types of potato&#xD;
      (biofortified-A or not-B). The first potato variety will be given during the first 2 weeks&#xD;
      (day 1-12) and the second sequence between days 15-26, (in both cases excluding weekend days&#xD;
      Saturday and Sunday). The potatoes will be cooked in water and offered mashed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken on 5 occasions, 1) at screening to verify compliance with the&#xD;
      exclusion and inclusion criteria; then on day 1 before participants eat the first type of&#xD;
      potato, day 15 before eating the second type of potato, day 26 after eating all both potato&#xD;
      types and on day 40 two weeks after eating all the potato.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of the potato Each participant will be served 500 g of potato divided into two&#xD;
      portions of 250 g each. each participant will take, depending on their allocation, 0.3 mg of&#xD;
      57FeSO4 (Peruanita potato) or 0.3 mg of 58FeSO4 (biofortified potato), diluted in 50 ml of&#xD;
      distilled water, which should be drunk while participants are eating the potato - halfway&#xD;
      through the meal. In addition, each participant will receive 200 ml of distilled water to&#xD;
      drink. The isotopes will be provided by ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in&#xD;
      Zurich). In addition, the isotopes that the investigators will use are stable isotopes, that&#xD;
      is participants exist naturally in the environment and as such do not pose any risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of biological samples for the measurement of iron using stable isotopes Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected throughout the intervention period as previously described and will&#xD;
      be sent to ETH, Zurich, following standard operating procedures. Participants will be&#xD;
      informed and will provide consent for the transfer and use of their samples outside Peru' for&#xD;
      the purpose of this research study. Samples will be anonymized and will not be transported&#xD;
      with personal identifiable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of processing, samples will be mixed with NO3 and H2O2 and digested in a microwave,&#xD;
      followed by separation of the iron from the blood matrix by way of exchange-anion&#xD;
      chromatography and a solvent (diluent) or extraction from the solvent using distilled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The isotopes will be analyzed using a plasma coupled inductive multicollector mass&#xD;
      spectrometer (Neptune; Thermo Finnigan). The amount of the labelled iron isotopes 57Fe and&#xD;
      58Fe will be measured 14 days after consumption of both types of potato has been completed.&#xD;
      The calculation (of absorption) will be done considering the subjects estimated blood volume&#xD;
      based on weight, height, and the subject's measured hemoglobin concentration (considering the&#xD;
      average of the initial and final blood sample). The calculation is based on the principle of&#xD;
      isotopic dilution considering as the factor for the iron isotope marker rather than the&#xD;
      monoisotopic marker8. For the calculation of the fraction absorbed the investigators will&#xD;
      assume 80% incorporation of the absorbed iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC METHODS FOR ZINC STUDY (Phase 2) Sample size The study requires a samples size of 40&#xD;
      women. This allows for a 40% loss to reach a final total of 24 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures According to the results of screening, and after checking that participants comply&#xD;
      with all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria participants will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the zinc part of the study. For this participant will be given the&#xD;
      second consent form to read and those who accept and sign the form will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The people who accept will be randomly allocated to eat one or other of the types of potato&#xD;
      (biofortified-A or no-B). All the participants will be given both types of potato but in&#xD;
      different order, in this way each participant will be their own control. The first variety of&#xD;
      potato will be given on day 1, after acceptance of participating in the study, and after&#xD;
      accepting and signing the consent form for this part: (consumption protocol and second&#xD;
      variety will be eaten 29 days after (the order of potato varieties will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will take blood samples on three occasions: enrolment and days 1 and 29&#xD;
      (the days when participants eat the potato) after fasting for 8 hours (food) and 6 hours&#xD;
      (liquids).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Measurements Anthropometry As part of the screening all the potential candidates will&#xD;
      be weighed and measured using standardized equipment. According to their weight and BMI the&#xD;
      investigators will decide whether participants are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented participants will be asked to provide a venous blood sample (approximately 10ml in&#xD;
      a test tube with heparin). Plasma and packed red cells will be obtained from the blood&#xD;
      samples and stored at &lt;18oC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample Consented participants will provide a urine sample (30ml) as part of the&#xD;
      screening phase to carry out a pregnancy test. On days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35&#xD;
      and 36 the investigators will collect urine samples to analyze zinc content. On each day the&#xD;
      investigators need 100ml of urine, collected in the morning (between 7-12 o'clock in the&#xD;
      morning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of the potato The subjects will be given a total of 1000 g of potato in two 500 g&#xD;
      portions. The first portion will be given while participants are fasted, (at least 8 hours&#xD;
      for food and 6 hours for drink) and in two separate servings (each one 250 g). When&#xD;
      participants have eaten the first 250 g serving, the subject will receive 0.25 mg of 67Zn&#xD;
      diluted in 50 ml of bottled water and then participants will receive the second serving of&#xD;
      potato. Two hours later, participants will receive an intravenous infusion of 70Zn (200 ug)&#xD;
      diluted in 50 ml of bottled water. After a further 2 hours participants will receive the&#xD;
      second two servings of potato, and, as before, after the first serving participants will&#xD;
      receive 0.25 mg of 67Zn diluted in 50 ml of bottled water. During this period and for 3 hours&#xD;
      after the second portion of potato the subject will not consume any food or liquid, except&#xD;
      for water which participants will be provided with. Each subject will receive 200 ml of water&#xD;
      with each meal and 200 ml of water between meals. Currently, using isotopes is the best&#xD;
      method for measuring the absorption of zinc. In addition, the isotopes that will be used are&#xD;
      stable isotopes, that is participants exist naturally in the environment and pose no risk. No&#xD;
      food or drink can be consumed for at least 3 hours after eating the final portion of potato.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for measurement of zinc The investigators will take a total of three blood&#xD;
      samples in total. Absorption using stable isotopes (Day 29) The blood samples that have been&#xD;
      collected will be sent to ETH, Zurich. ETH will undertake the analysis of CRP for Zinc. The&#xD;
      CRP will be measured using an ELISA kit. The plasma zinc concentration will be measured by&#xD;
      induction plasma coupled mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples for measurement of zinc using stable isotopes Samples of urine will be&#xD;
      concentrated using freeze drying and then mineralized by digestion in a microwave oven&#xD;
      (MLS-Turbowave; MLS GmbH) using a mixture of HNO3 and zinc isolated from the master matrix by&#xD;
      ion exchange chromatography. The investigators will use ultrapure acids for the preparation&#xD;
      of the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of zinc absorption Blood and zinc isotopic composition will be analyzed in&#xD;
      duplicate at the ETH Human Nutrition Laboratory. Urine samples will be mineralized by&#xD;
      microwave digestion (MLS-ETHOS plus; MLS GmbH) using a mixture of HNO3 and H2O2 and zinc&#xD;
      isolated from the sample matrix by ion-exchange chromatography (Wegmuller et al 2014). All&#xD;
      acids used for the preparation of samples will be ultrapure. 70Zn:66Zn and 67Zn:66Zn isotopic&#xD;
      ratios will be measured to determine 70Zn and 67Zn enrichment in the urine samples by using a&#xD;
      high-resolution double-focusing magnetic sector field multi-collector inductively coupled&#xD;
      plasma mass spectrometer (Finnigan Neptune; Thermo Electron).12 Fractional absorption of the&#xD;
      67Zn dose from the test meals will be calculated by using the oral to i.v. tracers ratio&#xD;
      method applied to spot urine samples, according to principles described by Friel et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-day food record Using the method of registering all foods eaten over a 7-day period the&#xD;
      investigators can obtain information on all foods eaten in a week (including Saturday and&#xD;
      Sunday). To achieve this, the investigators will ask the subjects to make a record of all&#xD;
      foods consumed, details of food preparation, and all drinks (including water) that&#xD;
      participants have eaten or drunk. Participants should note the meal at which the food and&#xD;
      drink were consumed, and the time taken to eat it (breakfast, lunch, supper and between meals&#xD;
      (snacks) and the amount eaten at each time of the day. To do this the investigators will give&#xD;
      the subjects a tablet in which to register the consumption/meals and as well take a photo of&#xD;
      all the food eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS SPECIFIC FOR IMPACT ASSESSMENT The data on dietary intake, serum ferritin and iron&#xD;
      bioavailability will be used for two modelling approaches. Firstly, the investigators will&#xD;
      apply the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) method, which is an appropriate method to&#xD;
      estimate nutritional and health impacts of biofortified crops. This will build upon models&#xD;
      that have been developed jointly by CIP and IIN that has made assumptions concerning iron and&#xD;
      zinc bioavailability from potatoes. Secondly, the investigators will use data on habitual&#xD;
      iron intake, serum ferritin concentrations and calculated physiological requirements for iron&#xD;
      to adapt a model estimate dietary iron bioavailability in Europe, the Andean highland region&#xD;
      and, more generally, to low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;
