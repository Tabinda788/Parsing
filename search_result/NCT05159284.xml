    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is assess the efficacy and safety of topical hydrocortisone&#xD;
      (Softacort) for treatment of clinical signs and symptoms of dry eye disease when associated&#xD;
      with moderate meibomian gland dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, randomized (1:1), single blind, of parallel groups and&#xD;
      two treatment arms clinical trial (phase IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with dry eye disease (DED) associated with moderate MGD may&#xD;
      participate in the study if they meet all the selection criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (or their representatives) will provide informed consent (IC) prior to the enrolment&#xD;
      in the study and to the start of data collection. Patients must meet all the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and not meet any of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This is a single-blinded study for the PI or person designated to conduct the study (blinded investigator). Study medication will be labelled as blinded medication. The prescription will be done by the blinded investigator using a kit number, and study medication delivery will be done by a person designed by the PI for this topic through the study (unblinded collaborator). Patients will be instructed not to inform the investigators who perform the ophthalmological evaluation about the group they will be assigned to. Patient assessments will be performed by blinded investigator.</masking_description>
