    <textblock>
      This First-in-human (FIH) trial for BNT116 aims to establish the safety profile and a safe&#xD;
      dose for BNT116 monotherapy as well as for BNT116 in combination with cemiplimab or in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or metastasized non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). The trial will comprise several cohorts for dose confirmation in monotherapy&#xD;
      as well as in combinations.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed unresectable Stage III or metastatic Stage&#xD;
             IV NSCLC and measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. Note: Patients in Cohort 1 do not have&#xD;
             to have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in Cohorts 2 and 4 must be able to tolerate additional anti-PD-1 therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., did not permanently discontinue anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) /&#xD;
             programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy due to toxicity) and must have recovered to&#xD;
             stage 1 or 0 from any previous PD-1/PD-L1-related toxicity or be on a stable hormone&#xD;
             substitute therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in Cohorts 2 and 3 must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
             performance status (ECOG-PS) ≤1. Patients in Cohort 1 and 4 with an ECOG-PS of 0-2 are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort-specific inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients' prior therapy must have included at least a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and a&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy regimen as well as one other line of systemic therapy&#xD;
             (except if a patient is not candidate for a platinum-based chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
             PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and/or another line of systemic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must present with PD-L1 expression of tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50% in&#xD;
             tumor cells (as determined locally prior to inclusion in this trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must present with progressive disease either&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. in the advanced or metastasized stage of NSCLC: while on a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor&#xD;
                  therapy or within 6 months of termination of this treatment as first-line&#xD;
                  treatment. Or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. be refractory to ongoing adjuvant therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor that has&#xD;
                  been given for at least 3 months in monotherapy (i.e., after an initial&#xD;
                  combination therapy) before being enrolled into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients' prior therapy must have included at least a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and a&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (except if a patient is not candidate for a&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy and/or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients' who are not candidates for chemotherapy as first-line treatment for the&#xD;
             advanced or metastasized stage of NSCLC may be enrolled if presenting with PD-L1&#xD;
             expression: TPS ≥1% in tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing active systemic treatment against NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a driver mutation for which approved target therapies are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or recent evidence (within the last 5 years) of significant autoimmune disease&#xD;
             that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments which may suggest&#xD;
             risk for immune-related adverse events. Note: Patients with autoimmune-related&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism, autoimmune-related hypothyroidism who are in remission, or on a&#xD;
             stable dose of thyroid-replacement hormone, vitiligo, or psoriasis may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence of new or growing brain or spinal metastases during screening.&#xD;
             Patients with leptomeningeal disease are excluded. Patients with known brain or spinal&#xD;
             metastases may be eligible if they:&#xD;
&#xD;

             metastases, AND&#xD;

          -  have no neurological symptoms that can be attributed to the current brain lesions, AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have stable brain or spinal disease on the computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan within 4 weeks before signing the informed consent&#xD;
             (confirmed by stable lesions on two scans at least 4 weeks apart), AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  do not require steroid therapy for the treatment of brain or spinal metastases within&#xD;
             14 d before the first dose of trial treatment. Note: Spinal bone metastases (i.e., of&#xD;
             the vertebrae) are allowed, unless imminent fracture or cord compression is&#xD;
             anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic immune suppression:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of chronic systemic steroid medication (≤5 mg/day prednisolone equivalent&#xD;
             is allowed); patients using physiological replacement doses of prednisone for adrenal&#xD;
             or pituitary insufficiency are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other clinically relevant systemic immune suppression within the last 3 months before&#xD;
             trial enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with CD4+&#xD;
             T-cell (CD4+) counts &lt;350 cells/µL and with a history of acquired immunodeficiency&#xD;
             syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior splenectomy.&#xD;
