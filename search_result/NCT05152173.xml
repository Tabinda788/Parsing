        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a diagnosis of plantar fibromatosis AND have at least 1 measurable, hard or firm,&#xD;
             palpable fibrous nodule on clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has no significant medical history or examination findings related to the&#xD;
             participant's plantar nodule(s), which in the investigator's opinion, would make the&#xD;
             participant unsuitable for study intervention administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Agree not to use opioids during the study period and has not used opioids 2 weeks&#xD;
             before the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Agree to not initiate or change use of orthotics or inserts designed to relieve&#xD;
             symptoms of plantar fibromatosis during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If female, be of non-childbearing potential (history of hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or postmenopausal with no history of menstrual&#xD;
             flow in the 12 months prior to the Screening Visit); or, if of childbearing potential,&#xD;
             be non-pregnant, non-lactating and agree to use effective contraception when with a&#xD;
             male partner for the duration of the study and for 28 days after any active treatment&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to comply with all protocol required visits and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be adequately informed and understand the nature and risks of the study and be able to&#xD;
             provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has the presence of non-plantar fibromatosis-related nodules on the foot/feet (eg,&#xD;
             neurofibroma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, neurilemmomas, rheumatoid nodules,&#xD;
             desmoid tumors, or malignant soft tissue lesions of the foot or ankle).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has any musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, neurosensory, other neurological or related&#xD;
             disorder that affects the participant's use of his or her feet and/or would impair&#xD;
             his/her completion of study assessments as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has a known allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of EN3835.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a known coagulation disorder or is taking any medications that would increase the&#xD;
             risk of bleeding (except &lt;150mg of aspirin daily), 7 days prior to first injection and&#xD;
             for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has concurrent diseases that might interfere with the conduct of the study, confound&#xD;
             the interpretation of the study results or endanger the participant's well-being. If&#xD;
             there is a history of such disease and the condition has been stable for greater than&#xD;
             one year and is judged by the investigator not to interfere, the participant may be&#xD;
             included, with the documented approval of the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is from a vulnerable population, as defined by the US Code of Federal Regulations&#xD;
             (CFR) Title 45, Part 46, Section 46.111(b) and other local and national regulations,&#xD;
             including but not limited to, employees (temporary, part-time, full-time, etc) or a&#xD;
             family member of the research staff conducting the study, or of the sponsor, or of the&#xD;
             contract research organization, or of the IRB/IEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has any other condition(s) that, in the investigator's opinion, might indicate the&#xD;
             participants to be unsuitable for the study.&#xD;
