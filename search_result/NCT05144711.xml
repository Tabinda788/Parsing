  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is one of the most prevalent non-communicable disease. However, despite its&#xD;
      prevalence there is no consensus on how much caries to remove prior to placing a restoration&#xD;
      to achieve optimal outcomes. Evidence for selective compared to complete nonselective&#xD;
      excavation suggests there may be benefit for selective removal in sustaining tooth vitality&#xD;
      while histological studies reveal that the remaining dentine is actually infected and may&#xD;
      cause loss of vitality in long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to randomly compare selective to non-elective excavation methods in&#xD;
      carious mature permanent teeth with symptoms of reversible pulpitis&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to randomly compare selective to nonselective excavation methods in&#xD;
      carious mature permanent teeth with symptoms of reversible pulpitis over 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will be collected from the initial treatment unit and the undergraduate clinics over a&#xD;
      8 months' period, the minimum sample size required is 120 teeth in 120 patients for an&#xD;
      assumed difference of 20% in the success rate and accounting for 20% wear rate in the follow&#xD;
      up, randomization will be performed using tabular randomization. Intensity of pulp symptoms&#xD;
      will be recorded, patient's description of sensitivity to hot/cold/sweet lasting up to 15-20s&#xD;
      and settling spontaneously are considered mild, while increased pain for more than several&#xD;
      minutes and needing pain killers are considered severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient age (16-60) years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non -contributory medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deep caries extending&gt;= 2/3 of dentine but not exposing the pulp on the radiograph&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tooth should give positive response to cold testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical diagnosis of reversible pulpitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tooth is restorable, probing pocket depth and mobility are within normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No signs of pulpal necrosis including sinus tract or swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No radiographic evidence of periapical changes indicative of apical periodontitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative pulpal and periapical diagnosis will be established after clinical examination&#xD;
      including soft tissue palpation, percussion, and cold testing (, and digital periapical and&#xD;
      bitewing radiographs will be taken using film holders and a paralleling technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of the patient (age, gender) and the treated tooth (number,&#xD;
      position, caries extension) will be recorded. Each tooth will be randomly allocated for the&#xD;
      choice of treatment with selective or nonselective caries excavation according to a random&#xD;
      sequence number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedure: The clinical procedure will be performed by one calibrated postgraduate&#xD;
      student under supervision. The tooth will be anesthetized with , rubber dam will be applied&#xD;
      and the tooth crown will be disinfected with 5% NaOCl before caries excavation; The cases&#xD;
      will be divided randomly into:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: One-stage selective carious-tissue removal to soft or firm dentine, using&#xD;
      carbon-steel rose- head burs (ash instruments) in a slow speed headpiece, the excavation end&#xD;
      point is the detection of leathery dentine using a sharp dental explorer and excavator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Non-selective carious-tissue removal. The tooth will be isolated with rubber dam and&#xD;
      disinfected with NaOCl. Complete caries excavation will be removed from the entire cavity,&#xD;
      inspection under the microscope will be done to identify pulp exposure. If no pulp exposure&#xD;
      is evident Biodentine will be placed and the cavity will be restored with composite. If pulp&#xD;
      exposure occurred, and it is bleeding normally and uniformly red with no zones of&#xD;
      degeneration or necrosis then direct pulp capping will be the choice of the treatment. The&#xD;
      bleeding will be controlled via gentle pressure with a cotton pellet soaked with 2.5% NaOCl&#xD;
      over the pulpal wound for 2 minutes and repeated if required up to 5 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, 2mm of Biodentine will be used and vitrebond will be placed as a liner on&#xD;
      top, this will be followed by etching with 37% orthophosphoric acid, rinsing with water, and&#xD;
      then bonding with adhesive followed by the placement of resin composite. Flowable composites&#xD;
      will be used in deep cavities if needed. Clinical and radiographic success will be evaluated&#xD;
      at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 4 years postoperatively.&#xD;
