    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of tazemetostat and&#xD;
      umbralisib and whether tazemetostat in combination with umbralisib and ublituximab works to&#xD;
      shrink tumors in patients with follicular lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractor). Tazemetostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Umbralisib may help block the formation&#xD;
      of growths that may become cancer. Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving tazemetostat in combination with&#xD;
      umbralisib and ublituximab may work better in treating follicular lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a regimen combining tazemetostat, umbralisib and&#xD;
      ublituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the overall response rate (ORR) in relapsed/refractory FL patients treated with&#xD;
      tazemetostat, umbralisib and ublituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the complete response (CR) rate, time to response, duration of response (DOR),&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in relapsed/refractory FL patients&#xD;
      treated with tazemetostat, umbralisib and ublituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine the immune effects of concurrent targeting of PI3K and EZH2 in patients with FL.&#xD;
      II. Examine the evolution of tumor genetic profile while on therapy with tazemetostat,&#xD;
      umbralisib and ublituximab, as determined by liquid biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of tazemetostat and umbralisib followed by&#xD;
      a phase II trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ublituximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, day 1 of&#xD;
      cycle 2-6, and day 1 of every 3 cycles thereafter. Patients also receive tazemetostat orally&#xD;
      (PO) twice daily (BID) umbralisib by PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;

             study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to&#xD;
