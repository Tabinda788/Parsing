      The study will be conducted using the crossover randomized controlled method. Preterm infants&#xD;
      who began oral feeding from the neonatal intensive care unit will be divided into two groups&#xD;
      through randomization in the computer environment. Following the randomization, infants in&#xD;
      Group 1 will be fed by applying elastic swaddling at the first feeding hour after they are&#xD;
      included in the study and in the next feeding they will be fed without performing any&#xD;
      application. Infants in Group 2 will be fed without performing any application at the first&#xD;
      feeding hour after they are included in the study and they will be fed at the second feeding&#xD;
      hour by applying elastic swaddling. Infants in both groups will be fed by the researcher with&#xD;
      a bottle in a semi-fowler right lateral position during feeding hours. During feeding, the&#xD;
      effect of the elastic sac on the infant's feeding status and physiological parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swaddling method is a method which can be used for preserving thermoregulation, decreasing&#xD;
      stress and maintaining comfort in term and preterm infants during painful procedures. The&#xD;
      effect of the elastic swaddling method which is thought to imitate the uterus environment, on&#xD;
      physiological parameters and feeding performance of infants during feeding will be evaluated.&#xD;
      The elastic swaddling method will be applied with 100% cotton and elastic fabric. The&#xD;
      single-use elastic and cotton fabric was sewed as a U-shaped sac for each infant included in&#xD;
      the study. The infant will be placed in the sac during the feeding hour and will be placed in&#xD;
      a position in which he/she can move easily, maintain the flexion posture and feel safe&#xD;
      contrary to traditional swaddling. The purpose of the study is to evaluate stress-associated&#xD;
      physiological parameters and feeding status during oral feeding in preterm infants starting&#xD;
      oral feeding. The study will be conducted using the crossover randomized controlled method.&#xD;
      The sample size of the study was determined via the power analysis in accordance with the&#xD;
      results obtained from studies conducted via a similar research method. According to the&#xD;
      results of the analyses, a total of 26 preterm infants including 13 for each group will be&#xD;
      included in the study group. After informing the families of infants meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria both in written and oral forms, the study will be conducted with mothers who agree&#xD;
      to participate in the study and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application Stages GROUP 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feeding Time Half an hour before the feeding time, the infant's heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
           saturation will be recorded in the observation form. The infant will be placed in the&#xD;
           elastic sac and the angle of the incubator bed will be elevated 45 degrees. He/she will&#xD;
           be laid in the right lateral position within the nest and will be allowed to take a rest&#xD;
           within the elastic sac until the feeding time (30 minutes). Giving priority to breast&#xD;
           milk, formula milk at optimum temperature will be prepared for infants without breast&#xD;
           milk. The nutrient amount ordered by the doctor will be put in the bottle. Ten minutes&#xD;
           before the feeding time, the infant's heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded&#xD;
           in the observation form every two minutes. At the feeding time, the bottle will be&#xD;
           approached to the infant's mouth for feeding in the semi-fowler right lateral position&#xD;
           at 45 degrees without making any change in his/her posture. As soon as the infant begins&#xD;
           to suck, the chronometer will be started and the infant's heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
           saturation will be recorded by another observer nurse every two minutes throughout&#xD;
           feeding. When the infant shows signs of fatigue (Spo2 less than 90, HR higher than 160),&#xD;
           the feeding will be discontinued and when the infant's HR fall below 160 and spO2&#xD;
           increases above 90, the feeding will continue. The time of feeding will be limited to a&#xD;
           maximum of 30 minutes. When the infant stops feeding, the chronometer will be stopped,&#xD;
           the feeding will be terminated and the infant will be allowed to take a rest. His/her&#xD;
           heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded in the observation form every two&#xD;
           minutes for ten minutes. Then, the elastic sac application will be terminated and an&#xD;
           onesie will be put on the infant in line with the care procedures of the clinic and&#xD;
           he/she will be allowed to take a rest until the next feeding hour. The amount (cc) of&#xD;
           milk the infant receives from the ordered amount of the milk and the amount of nutrient&#xD;
           he/she receives in a minute will be calculated and recorded in the observation form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feeding Time Half an hour before the feeding time, the infant's heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
           saturation will be recorded in the observation form. The angle of the incubator bed will&#xD;
           be elevated 45 degrees. Only an onesie will be put on the infant in line with the care&#xD;
           procedures of the clinic and no other application will be performed. He/she will be laid&#xD;
           in the right lateral position within the nest and will be allowed to take a rest until&#xD;
           the feeding time. In order to feed him/her the same nutrient at both feeding hours, the&#xD;
           same nutrient prepared at the previous feeding hour will be prepared at optimum&#xD;
           temperature. The nutrient amount ordered by the doctor will be put in the bottle. Ten&#xD;
           minutes before the feeding hour, the infant's heart rate and oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
           recorded in the observation form every two minutes. At the feeding hour, the bottle will&#xD;
           be approached to the infant's mouth for feeding in the semi-fowler right lateral&#xD;
           position at 45 degrees without making any change in his/her position. As soon as the&#xD;
           infant begins to suck, the chronometer will be started and the infant's heart rate and&#xD;
           oxygen saturation will be recorded by another observer nurse every two minutes&#xD;
           throughout feeding. When the infant shows signs of fatigue (Spo2 less than 90, HR higher&#xD;
           than 160), the feeding will be discontinued and when the infant's HR falls below 160 and&#xD;
           spO2 increases above 90, the feeding will continue. The time of feeding will be limited&#xD;
           to a maximum of 30 minutes. When the infant stops feeding, the chronometer will be&#xD;
           stopped, the feeding will be terminated and the infant will be allowed to take a rest.&#xD;
           His/her heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded in the observation form every&#xD;
           two minutes for ten minutes. The infant will be allowed to take a rest in line with the&#xD;
           care procedures of the clinic. The amount (cc) of milk the infant receives from the&#xD;
           ordered amount of the milk and the amount of nutrient he/she receives in a minute will&#xD;
           be calculated and recorded in the observation form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feeding Time Half an hour before the feeding time, the infant's heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
           saturation will be recorded in the observation form. The angle of the incubator bed will&#xD;
           be elevated 45 degrees. Only an onesie will be put on the infant in line with the care&#xD;
           procedures of the clinic and no other application will be performed. He/she will be laid&#xD;
           in the right lateral position within the nest and will be allowed to take a rest until&#xD;
           the feeding time (30 minutes). Giving priority to breast milk, formula milk at optimum&#xD;
           temperature will be prepared for infants without breast milk. The nutrient amount&#xD;
           ordered by the doctor will be put in the bottle. Ten minutes before the feeding hour,&#xD;
           the infant's heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded in the observation form&#xD;
           every two minutes. At the feeding hour, the bottle will be approached to the infant's&#xD;
           mouth for feeding in the semi-fowler right lateral position at 45 degrees without making&#xD;
           any change in his/her position. As soon as the infant begins to suck, the chronometer&#xD;
           will be started and the infant's heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded by&#xD;
           another observer nurse every two minutes throughout feeding. When the infant shows signs&#xD;
           of fatigue (Spo2 less than 90, HR higher than 160), the feeding will be discontinued and&#xD;
           when the infant's HR falls below 160 and spO2 increases above 90, the feeding will&#xD;
           continue. The time of feeding will be limited to a maximum of 30 minutes. When the&#xD;
           infant stops feeding, the chronometer will be stopped, the feeding will be terminated&#xD;
           and the infant will be allowed to take a rest. His/her heart rate and oxygen saturation&#xD;
           will be recorded in the observation form every two minutes for ten minutes. The infant&#xD;
           will be allowed to take a rest until the next feeding hour in line with the care&#xD;
           procedures of the clinic. Amount (cc) of milk the infant receives from the ordered&#xD;
           amount of the milk and the amount of nutrient he/she receives in a minute will be&#xD;
           calculated and recorded in the record form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feeding Time Half an hour before the feeding time, the infant's heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
           saturation will be recorded in the observation form. The infant will be placed in the&#xD;
           elastic sac and the angle of the incubator bed will be elevated 45 degrees. He/she will&#xD;
           be laid in the right lateral position within the nest and will be allowed to take a rest&#xD;
           within the elastic sac until the feeding time. In order to feed him/her the same&#xD;
           nutrient at both feeding hours, the same nutrient prepared during the previous feeding&#xD;
           hour will be prepared at optimum temperature. The nutrient amount ordered by the doctor&#xD;
           will be put in the bottle. Ten minutes before the feeding time, the infant's heart rate&#xD;
           and oxygen saturation will be recorded in the observation form every two minutes. At the&#xD;
           feeding time, the bottle will be approached to the infant's mouth for feeding in the&#xD;
           semi-fowler right lateral position at 45 degrees without making any change in his/her&#xD;
           position. As soon as the infant begins to suck, the chronometer will be started and the&#xD;
           infant's heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded by another observer nurse&#xD;
           every two minutes throughout feeding. When the infant shows signs of fatigue (Spo2 less&#xD;
           than 90, HR higher than 160), the feeding will be discontinued and when the infant's HR&#xD;
           falls below 160 and spO2 increases above 90, the feeding will continue. The time of&#xD;
           feeding will be limited to a maximum of 30 minutes. When the infant stops feeding, the&#xD;
           chronometer will be stopped, the feeding will be terminated and the infant will be&#xD;
           allowed to take a rest. His/her heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded in the&#xD;
           observation form every two minutes for ten minutes. Then, the elastic sac application&#xD;
           will be terminated and he/she will be allowed to take a rest in line with the care&#xD;
           procedures of the clinic. The amount (cc) of milk the infant receives from the ordered&#xD;
           amount of the milk and the amount of nutrient he/she receives in a minute will be&#xD;
           calculated and recorded in the observation form.&#xD;

    <description>In order to assess the feeding status of the infant, his/her time of feeding and the amount of nutrient he/she receives in a minute will be calculated. In order to determine his/her time of feeding, a phone chronometer will be started as soon as he/she begins feeding and it will be stopped when feeding is over. All infants in Group 1 and Group 2 will be fed with a slow-flow bottle branded Avent which is designed for premature infants. It will be calculated how much (cc) of the total amount of nutrient ordered by the doctor the infant receives. The total amount of nutrient received by the infant will be divided into the time of feeding and thus the amount of nutrient received in a minute (cc) will be calculated.</description>
