  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis represents failed repair of joint damage resulting from stresses initiated by&#xD;
      any joint or periarticular tissue abnormality. The rate of progression varies among persons&#xD;
      and within a knee over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms and signs of knee osteoarthritis include pain, stiffness, reduced joint motion,&#xD;
      and muscle weakness. Long-term consequences can include reduced physical activity,&#xD;
      deconditioning, impaired sleep, fatigue, depression, and disability.This reduction in&#xD;
      activity to avoid pain (kinesiophobia) to evade the onset of pain, especially in the acute&#xD;
      phase, limiting their compliance with effective rehabilitation strategies such as regular&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical medicine has a wide range of analgesic anti-inflammatory and muscle stimulating&#xD;
      treatment methods. Both diadynamic and TENS currents have become the most frequently&#xD;
      implemented electrotherapeutic methods. The impact of diadynamic currents consists of&#xD;
      analgesic effects and specific dynamics during the formation of physiological processes in&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They occur during the administration of the current and lasts up to a few hours after the&#xD;
      treatment has been terminated. One of the theories explaining the analgesic effect of&#xD;
      diadynamic currents is the gate control theory of pain by Wall and Melzack. Recently, another&#xD;
      theory has become very popular. It explains the analgesic effect provoked by bodies&#xD;
      characterized as polypeptides called endorphins. Electric stimulation using diadynamic&#xD;
      currents generates an increase in the amount of endorphins in a system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the analgesic impact of TENS therapy is well known, Diadynamic currents therapies&#xD;
      have not been studied in knee osteoarthritis pain conditions. Therefore, the aim of the&#xD;
      present study was to investigate the medium-term effects of Diadynamic currents combined with&#xD;
      exercise on pain and disability in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included patients who attended the Special Rehabilitation Services in Taboão da&#xD;
      Serra-SP, with knee osteoarthritis diagnosed by an independent rehabilitation specialist, and&#xD;
      fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) aged from 50 and 75; (2) symptomatic knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis for at least three months; (3) visual analogue scale12 score above 3 and (4)&#xD;
      radiographic knee osteoarthritis (uni or bilateral) compatible with Kellgren-Lawrence grade&#xD;
      two or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were as follows: contraindication to laser application (e.g. cancer&#xD;
      and insulin-dependent diabetes); inability to perform the assessment or treatment; continuous&#xD;
      use of anti-inflammatory drugs, symptomatic hip osteoarthritis and physiotherapeutic knee&#xD;
      treatment within the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potentially eligible participants were contacted by telephone and those interested in&#xD;
      participating were invited to attend a physical examination for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criterion. All participants were informed about the study and provided informed consent&#xD;
      before participating. They were assigned by block randomization, stratified according to&#xD;
      treatment group. An independent researcher not involved in outcome assessment was responsible&#xD;
      for group allocation, using a computer-generated random number table. Immediately after&#xD;
      baseline assessment by the blinded assessor, the treating physiotherapist accessed the&#xD;
      allocation schedule from a centrally located locked cabinet. Patients and the physiotherapist&#xD;
      responsible for the evaluation and physiotherapist responsible for the treatment were all&#xD;
      unaware of the randomization results as allocation to groups was concealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and anthropometric data, the use of pain relief medications, the duration of knee&#xD;
      pain, the knee range of motion, and a range of patient-reported outcomes were collected at&#xD;
      baseline (before randomization) and 8 weeks from baseline by the same blinded evaluator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes were pain intensity measured by the numeric pain rating scale (0-10)&#xD;
      with a minimal clinically important change set at two points and disability measured using&#xD;
      the Lequesne questionnaire, which consists of 11 questions about pain, discomfort, and&#xD;
      function. Scores range from 0 to 24 (from 'no' to 'extremely severe' dysfunction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included medication intake (Paracetamol) for knee pain relief, mobility&#xD;
      and balance, range of motion, muscular strength, and activity. Mobility and balance were&#xD;
      evaluated by the Timed Up and Go test. The Timed Up and Go test, a measure of functional&#xD;
      mobility, quantifies in seconds the time that the individual needs to stand up from a chair,&#xD;
      walk 3m, turn back toward the chair and sit down again. Range of motion of the knees was&#xD;
      measured with a universal goniometer (AESCULAP). Muscular strength was estimated at maximal&#xD;
      isometric force for the quadriceps, using a portable dynamometer (Lafayette, USA). Under&#xD;
      stabilized conditions, patients, sitting with knees flexed at 60 (measured by a goniometer),&#xD;
      were asked to extend the legs as far as they could. Three attempts were conducted, and the&#xD;
      mean value was obtained. Muscular strength was estimated at maximal isometric force for the&#xD;
      quadriceps, using a portable dynamometer. Under stabilized conditions, patients, sitting with&#xD;
      knees flexed at 10, 60 and 90 degrees (measured by a goniometer), were asked to extend the&#xD;
      legs as far as they could. Three attempts were conducted and the mean value was obtained.&#xD;
      Physical activity was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis questionnaire, which is self-administered and measures pain, stiff joints, and&#xD;
      physical activity. Increased scores suggest decreased activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all patients had osteoarthritis of both knees, and in every patient both knees&#xD;
      were treated with the allocated treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Group I received Diadynamic currents associated to Exercise while the&#xD;
      Group II received only exercises three times a week for 8 weeks following initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group I, Diadynamic currents was performed with the following parameters: application of&#xD;
      the two-phase current and then the long-term one. Each current was applied for 4 minutes on&#xD;
      the medial and lateral sides of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients followed the same training program (Table 1). The intervention was divided into&#xD;
      Phase-1, Phase-2 and Phase-3 during eight weeks with three sessions a week. Each session&#xD;
      lasted 45 minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 minutes warming-up (treadmill, ergometer bike or rowing machine);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 minutes 2-3 sets with Phase-1, Phase-2 and Phase-3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 minutes stretching (hamstrings, quadriceps, adductors, and gastrocmenius).&#xD;
           Participants were instructed not to use analgesic medications other than paracetamol&#xD;
           (500 mg/day) or anti-inflammatory drugs during the study, and not to perform any other&#xD;
           type of physical exercise in addition to the exercise performed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After describing the data, the hypothesis of normality of continuous variables was tested&#xD;
      using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The age, weight, height and BMI of volunteers between groups&#xD;
      were compared using Student's t-test for independent samples. To investigate the effect of&#xD;
      the treatment on the pre and post evaluation, as well as the interaction of this effect&#xD;
      between the groups, the General Linear Models with mixed design (evaluations x groups) were&#xD;
      applied. To analyze the effects of the interactions, Tukey's Post Hoc tests were performed&#xD;
      considering an alpha error of 5%. All analyzes were performed using the statistical program R&#xD;
      version 3.1.3 using the R Commander graphical interface.&#xD;
