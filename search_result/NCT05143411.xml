  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1 DM) tend to have poor metabolic control. There&#xD;
      are no mobile applications in our language in our environment, and patients are accessible in&#xD;
      addition to the difficulties involved in these manual calculations. One way to bridge the&#xD;
      knowledge gaps in T1 DM self-management is by using technology to optimize metabolic control&#xD;
      and reduce the risks of associated comorbidities, with a mobile application that helps&#xD;
      optimize decision-making in self-management. This research aims to help people with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes to change the glycemic blood levels and to be able to calculate the food together&#xD;
      with the amount of insulin with food from the region. To evaluate the acceptability and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the application, the investigators will carry out a pilot evaluation test.&#xD;
      The participants in this pilot test will be 20 people between 14 and 18 years old with T1DM,&#xD;
      users of the pediatric diabetology service of the National Institute of Diabetes,&#xD;
      Endocrinology, and Nutrition (INDEN).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic lack of control in patients with type 1 diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) leads to kidney&#xD;
      failure, non-traumatic amputations, blindness, and reduced life expectancy. In addition,&#xD;
      determining the content of macronutrients in food is not the domain of many patients,&#xD;
      particularly adolescents, or some physicians, making insulin adjustment difficult, one of the&#xD;
      main failures of optimal metabolic control. One way to bridge the knowledge gaps in T1D&#xD;
      self-management is by using technology to optimize metabolic control and reduce the risks of&#xD;
      associated comorbidities, with a mobile application that helps optimize decision-making in&#xD;
      self-management. And a reduction of complications in adolescents (14-18 years) with T1DM.&#xD;
      This project aims to develop this application that contributes to decision-making and the&#xD;
      reduction of comorbidities of adolescents with T1DM, following the policies of the Dominican&#xD;
      state through Digital systems, together with its educational mission, technological access,&#xD;
      and national competitiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no mobile applications in use in the Dominican Republic for the self-management of&#xD;
      chronic diseases. Therefore, the investigators have designed a mobile application with a&#xD;
      postprandial insulin bolus calculator. In addition, the developers has added a list of foods&#xD;
      from the region where users can select their foods and adjust them with the amount of insulin&#xD;
      to metabolize them. The methodology includes a mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative)&#xD;
      before starting the study and after three months of using the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of the application, we will carry out a pilot&#xD;
      evaluation test. The participants in this pilot test will be 20 people between 14 and 18&#xD;
      years old with T1DM, users of INDEN. This experimental study has a systematized probabilistic&#xD;
      sample from the center's master list. They were randomized, not controlled. Therefore, the&#xD;
      participants are users of the pediatric diabetology service, and included prior explanation&#xD;
      and approval of informed consent. These 20 participants will be recruited, ensuring the&#xD;
      equitable distribution between gender and sociodemographic data of the mentioned group while&#xD;
      maintaining the intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients between 14-18 years old with diabetes type 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to use electronic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission due to acute decompensation of T1DM in previous 3 months, presence of more&#xD;
           than one severe monthly hypoglycemia, or any other circumstance that requires frequent&#xD;
           visits and intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators invited the participants to select foods and routinely use the mobile app's&#xD;
      insulin bolus calculator for three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data analysis, the researchers are going to perform the normality test for numerical&#xD;
      variables. Then, the categorical data presentation will be with frequencies and percentages&#xD;
      tables and the quantitative data as means and standard deviation, and use a non-Gaussian&#xD;
      distribution, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint, HbA1c at the beginning of the study and the end of the third month of&#xD;
      use of the application, will be analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests and for&#xD;
      pre-test and post-test comparisons of the study group, and the multifactorial analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANCOVA), baseline HbA1c level and at 3 months after using the application, taking&#xD;
      into account age as covariates. The investigators are going to use for statistical analysis&#xD;
      the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and Excel of the data obtained.&#xD;
