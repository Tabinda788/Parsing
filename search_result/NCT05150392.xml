      This is an open-labelled clinical trial of live attenuated varicella vaccines manufactured by&#xD;
      Sinovac (Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd .The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunity persistence of the single-dose primary immunization of live attenuated varicella&#xD;
      vaccine on different time points ,and the safety and immunogenicity after the booster&#xD;
      immunization&#xD;

      This study is an open-labelled phase Ⅲ clinical trial.The experimental vaccine manufactured&#xD;
      by Sinovac(Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd.A total of 1195 subjects who received vaccine&#xD;
      in the phase Ⅲ lot-consistency clinical trial were be enrolled .All subjects except C0243 and&#xD;
      C0556 were divided into 3 groups according to the order of study number.Subjects in 3 groups&#xD;
      received a booster immunization of live attenuated varicella vaccines 1 year,2 years and 3&#xD;
      years after primary immunization,respectively.About 3.0ml of venous blood was collected from&#xD;
      each enrolled subject at pre-booster immunization,30 days after booster immunization and the&#xD;
      serum was separated for neutralizing antibody detection.The antibody levels were used to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunity persistence and immunogenicity after booster immunization of live&#xD;
      attenuated varicella vaccines .&#xD;
