  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was comprised of 30 patients who were scheduled for a diagnostic bronchoscopy due&#xD;
      to a suspicion of lung cancer in order to obtain tissue samples for a final diagnosis , four&#xD;
      biopsies were taken by each of cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy , to evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield of endobronchial cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy in the diagnosis of lung&#xD;
      cancer .&#xD;

      Diagnostic bronchoscopic interventions are used to evaluate and tissue sample from&#xD;
      endobronchial lesions utilising variety of devices that can be delivered through the&#xD;
      operative channel of a fibrio-optic bronchoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the procedures were carried out with 2% lidocaine instillation and midazolam IV&#xD;
      sedation All patients signed a written informed consent form for bronchoscopy and tissue&#xD;
      sampling with forceps and a cryoprobe.between August 2020 and June 2021. All interventions&#xD;
      were performed in the bronchoscopy unit of the Chest Medicine Department at Benha university&#xD;
      Data were collected, revised, coded and entered to the Statistical Package for Social Science&#xD;
      (IBM SPSS) version 23. The quantitative data with parametric distribution were presented as&#xD;
      mean, standard deviations and ranges.&#xD;
