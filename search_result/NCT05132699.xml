  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this pilot project is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using&#xD;
      Cannabidiol (CBD) in combination with standard of care prolonged exposure (PE) psychotherapy&#xD;
      to reduce PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an early Phase II double-blind, pilot randomized controlled clinical trial. The&#xD;
      study team will use a permuted block randomization design stratified by a Posttraumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorder (PTSD) severity median score of 51 on the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) derived from&#xD;
      a recently completed STRONG STAR randomized clinical trial of military veterans seeking&#xD;
      treatment for PTSD. Participants will be 24 military veterans with PTSD to investigate the&#xD;
      safety, feasibility, and PTSD symptom change associated with CBD 250mg taken twice a day for&#xD;
      18 days (n=12) vs. placebo (n=12) in combination with a standard of care, 10-sessions massed&#xD;
      PE psychotherapy administered over 2 weeks. Aims 2 and 3 will evaluate biochemical and&#xD;
      physiological outcomes associated with the brain endocannabinoid (eCB) and PTSD that may be&#xD;
      affected by CBD. Permuted block randomization is advantageous in small clinical trials to&#xD;
      ensure equal allocation of participants in each condition. Participant randomization will be&#xD;
      subdivided into randomized blocks of four, two patients in each block will be assigned to CBD&#xD;
      and two will be assigned to placebo.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at about 45 days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is structured interview that assesses the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders v5 (DSM-5) criteria for PTSD. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and combines information about frequency and intensity for each of the 20 symptoms.Subscale scores are calculated by summing severity scores for items in the following PTSD symptom clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and hyperarousal. Scores â‰¥ 25 indicate a probable diagnosis of PTSD. Change in score will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Day 8, Day 15 and at about 45 days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure update of the PCL designed to assess PTSD symptoms as defined by the DSM-5. The PCL-5 evaluates how much participants have been bothered by PTSD symptoms in the past week (for all assessments during treatment) or the past two weeks (all other assessment time points) as a result of a specific life event. Each item of the PCL-5 is scored on a five-point scale ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely). Scores range from 0 to 80 with a higher score indicating that subjects have been bothered more by PTSD symptoms. Change in score will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive Symptoms Index-Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Day 8, Day 15 and at about 45 Days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The DSI-SS is a 4-item self-report measure of suicidal ideation that focuses on ideation, plans, perceived control over ideation, and impulses for suicide. Scores on each item range from 0 to 3, with higher scores reflecting greater severity of suicidal ideation. Total scores range from 0-12. Change in score will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Day 8, Day 15 and at about 45 Days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 9 items that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders; these 9 items correspond to the diagnostic criteria for Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Major Depressive Disorder (DSM MDD). Respondents rate the frequency with which they have been bothered by depressive symptoms within the past two weeks on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score between 0 and 27. Scores reflect no significant depressive symptoms (0-4), mild depressive symptoms (5-9), moderate depressive symptoms (10-14), moderately severe depressive symptoms (15-19), and severe depressive symptoms (&gt;19). Change in score is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Day 8, Day 15 and at about 45 Days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 7-item measure that asks participants to rate the frequency with which they have been bothered by anxiety symptoms within the past two weeks on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score ranging from 0-21. Scores reflect no significant anxiety symptoms (0-4), mild anxiety symptoms (5-9), moderate anxiety symptoms (10-14), and severe anxiety symptoms (&gt;15). Change in score is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (BIPF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at about 45 days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The BIPF is a 7-item self-report instrument measuring respondents' level of functioning in seven life domains: romantic relationship, relationship with children, family relationships, friendships and socializing, work, training and education, and activities of daily living. Respondents indicate the degree to which they had trouble in the last 30 days in each area on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;0 = Not at all&quot; to &quot;6 = Very much. Total scores range from 0 - 42 with a lower score indicating that the participants is less functional in these domains. Change in total score is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Veterans Rand 12-Item Heath Survey (VR-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at about 45 days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The questions in this survey correspond to seven different health domains: general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, energy/fatigue levels, social functioning and mental health in the past 30 days. Items are summarized into two component scores, a Physical Component Score (PCS) and a Mental Component Score (MCS). VR-12 scores are standardized using a T-score metric with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 with higher scores indicative of better health.&#xD;
Change in component scores is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at about 45 days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item self-report measure that assesses perceived severity of insomnia. Each item uses a 4-point Likert type scale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 4 (very much satisfied). The items sum to produce a total score (range 0 - 28) with a higher score indicating less insomnia. Change in total score will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Day 8, Day 15 and at about 45 Days (1 month follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The PTCI is a 36-item questionnaire that was developed to determine how an individual views the trauma and its sequelae in an attempt to understand both how PTSD develops and is maintained. The scale uses 3 subscales, Negative cognition about self (21 items), Negative cognition about the World (7 items) and Self blame (5 items). A total score is obtained by adding the 3 scores to give a possible score of 0 - 33. Items 13, 32 and 34 are experimental and not included in the subscales. A higher score implies greater negativity. A change in score will be reported.</description>
