      In this parallel, multicenter, single-blind randomized controlled trial, mechanical&#xD;
      ventilated patients will be randomly assigned to two groups. One receives remimazolam to&#xD;
      achieve sedation goals, while the other receives Midazolam. The primary outcome is the effect&#xD;
      of remimazolam on duration of mechanical ventilated of critical patients compared to&#xD;
      midazolam.&#xD;

      Investigational drug#remimazolam for injection Study title#Effect of Remimazolam with&#xD;
      Protocolized Sedation on Critical Ill, Mechanical Ventilated Patients Compared with Midazolam&#xD;
      - A parallel, Multicenter, Single-blind Randomized Controlled Trial Principal&#xD;
      Investigator#Professor Zhanguo Liu, Dr.Jing Cai, Department of Critical Care Unit, Zhujiang&#xD;
      Hospital, Southern Medical University Study subjects#Critical ill patients that are&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated within the first 48h of admission to the ICU and who would remain in&#xD;
      the ICU for over 72h are enrolled in this study. The ages of patients should be in the range&#xD;
      from 18 to 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phase# Investigator Initiated Trial(IIT) Study objectives#The objective of the study is&#xD;
      to determine whether remimazolam, compared with midazolam, reduces duration of ventilation in&#xD;
      severe patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design#A parallel, Multicenter, Single-blind Randomized Controlled Trial. Medication&#xD;
      method#Remimazolam group#Patients are administered with a bolus of remimazolam with&#xD;
      0.1-0.3mg/kg intravenously in 1 minute for the first time. And the maintenance dose is&#xD;
      0.25-0.1mg/kg/h, meanwhile the dose of remimazolam should be titrated according to Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores. Nonbenzodiazepines could be administrated to the&#xD;
      patients if sedation targets were not achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midazolam group#Patients are administered with a bolus of midazolam with 0.01-0.05mg/kg&#xD;
      intravenously in 1 minute for the first time. And maintenance dose is 0.02-0.1mg/kg/h,&#xD;
      meanwhile the dose of midazolam should be titrated according to Richmond Agitation Sedation&#xD;
      Scale (RASS) scores. Nonbenzodiazepines could be administrated to the patients if sedation&#xD;
      targets were not achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous breathing test (SBT) is conducted daily while patients are stable. Weaning would&#xD;
      be considered after a successful SBT, and the sedation for study need to be stopped&#xD;
      subsequently. If the weaning failed, mechanical ventilation and sedation would be used&#xD;
      immediately according to sedation targets. Weaning success is defined as the ability to&#xD;
      successfully complete the SBT and sustain spontaneous breathing for 48h after extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course#28days Sample size#440. Sites#15 Primary endpoint#Duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation(weaning success is typically regarded as consecutive ventilator-free over 24h&#xD;
      following liberation from a ventilator. The duration of mechanical ventilation is from the&#xD;
      enrollment time to the weaning time. The study and observation would be stopped due to&#xD;
      difficult ventilator weaning, which features weaning failure repeatedly for 3 weeks.)&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints#&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Duration of endotracheal intubation(calculated from the time of enrollment);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Completion rate of sedation goals (completion rate of sedation goal = days of achieving&#xD;
           sedation goals / total days of sedation (days from enrollment to successful ventilator&#xD;
           withdrawal) × 100%）)；&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sedation remediation is defined as requiring combination with other nonbenzodiazepines&#xD;
           sedations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Length of stay in ICU and total length of stay (time from admission to discharge);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Others: anterograde amnesia, 28 day mortality, total cost of sedative drugs in ICU,&#xD;
           hospitalization expenses in ICU; Anterograde amnesia used a questionnaire that is record&#xD;
           to assess the patient's forgetfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints#&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of Hypotension(20% fall in systolic pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of Delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of spontaneous extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of reintubation in 12h or tracheotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Incidence of Myasthenia.(following weaning from ventilations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Incidence of thrombus.(lower extremity deep venous thrombosis)&#xD;
