  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During 2018, 2019, and 2020, the reported TBE-cases have increased markedly in Norway.&#xD;
      Surveillance studies conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health demonstrate that&#xD;
      cases are associated with tick bites in the coastal areas of the Agder, Buskerud, and&#xD;
      Vestfold and Telemark counties There is a urgent need for more knowledge of the consequences&#xD;
      of TBE in Norway, in particular the identification of patients at risk of long-term sequela.&#xD;
      Hence, the overall objective of this project is to gain more knowledge about the natural&#xD;
      course of TBE in Norway, and its impact on long-term health-related quality of life and&#xD;
      associated factors. Clinical data, biological sampling and PROMs are collected from&#xD;
      TBE-infected patients admitted to three hospitals within the epidemic region in Norway.&#xD;

      This project is designed as a multicenter study divided into four sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 1: A retrospective descriptive study of the clinical features and objective findings&#xD;
      of the acute phase of the TBE-patients diagnosed with TBE in South-East Norway during 2018,&#xD;
      2019 and 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 2: A prospective multicenter study of health related QOL one year after&#xD;
      hospitalization with TBE in South-East Norway from 2019 - 2023. The self-reported&#xD;
      health-related QOL (assesedby SF-36) of the TBE-patients will be compared with the SF-36&#xD;
      reference values in the Norwegian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 3: A prospective multicenter study of self-reported cognitive function one year&#xD;
      after hospitalization with TBE in South-East Norway from 2019- 2023. The cognitive function,&#xD;
      measured by PROMS, will be compared with PROMS from an included reference group from the&#xD;
      patient's social environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 4: Analyses of biological samples collected at baseline, 3 months and 12 months&#xD;
      after hospitalization for TBE in patients included in substudy 2 and 3. These analyses will&#xD;
      be conducted to gain more knowledge of the pathogenesis of TBE infection and in particular,&#xD;
      which molecular pathways and biomarkers that characterize the TBE infected patients who are&#xD;
      hospitalized in Norway. Analyses to identify associations between the acute inflammatory&#xD;
      response and long-term outcome will be performed.&#xD;
