  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive surgery with many advantages,&#xD;
      it is one of the operations with high postoperative pain scores. Opioids are frequently used&#xD;
      to prevent postoperative pain. Due to the side effects of opioids, the amount of use is tried&#xD;
      to be reduced. Regional anesthesia techniques can be used to minimize opioid consumption.&#xD;
      Erector spina plane block was first described in 2016 by Forero et al. in the treatment of&#xD;
      thoracic neuropathic pain. Since then, ESP block has been used as an anesthetic and analgesic&#xD;
      technique. It is applied by injecting local anesthetic into the fascial plane located between&#xD;
      the erector spina muscle and the transverse process of the vertebra. Several high-level&#xD;
      studies have shown that the ESP block can be used to reduce postoperative pain after&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery. Several studies have evaluated the effect of ESP block for pain&#xD;
      relief after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ESP block has been applied unilaterally or&#xD;
      bilaterally in various studies. However, in the current studies in the literature, the&#xD;
      advantages or disadvantages of the bilateral application of the ESP block compared to the&#xD;
      unilateral application have not been evaluated. In our study, we aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      postoperative pain by applying ESP block to patients who underwent laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy and to evaluate the advantages of unilateral or bilateral application of ESP&#xD;
      block over each other.&#xD;

    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms.</description>

    <description>Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is an interfascial plane block where a local anaesthetic is injected in a plane preferably below the erector spinae muscle. It is supposed to work at the origin of spinal nerves based on cadaveric and contrast study. It has emerged as an effective and safe analgesic regional technique. It will be done at T7-8 level</description>
