      The purpose of this study is to determine the features of clinical imaging, disease severity&#xD;
      and pregnancy outcomes in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome with preeclampsia or&#xD;
      eclampsia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively collected data (General information, clinical data,&#xD;
      biochemical indicators, imaging features, and pregnancy outcome) from pregnant woman&#xD;
      diagnosed with PRES with preeclampsia or eclampsia to analyze features of clinical imaging,&#xD;
      disease severity and pregnancy outcomes during 2012 to 2021.Then, the investigators grouped&#xD;
      all the patients into early onset group and late onset PE group according to gestational&#xD;
      weeks to analyze differences of clinical imaging. Finally, the investigators grouped all the&#xD;
      patients into good pregnancy outcomes group and poor pregnancy outcomes group according to&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria, including the incidence of stillbirth and premature birth, to analyze&#xD;
      differences of clinical imaging .&#xD;
