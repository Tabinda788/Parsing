    <textblock>
      Patient-ventilator asynchronies can occur as a result of a mismatch between neural (patient)&#xD;
      and ventilator inspiratory and expiratory phases. Typically, asynchronies are detected by&#xD;
      visual inspection of ventilator waveforms. Sensitivity of this visual analysis, even when&#xD;
      performed by experts in the field, is low, around 28% in one landmark publication. Processing&#xD;
      the same ventilator waveforms by an artificial intelligence algorithm can produce inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle pressure estimations (Pmus). The impact of the display of Pmus together with the other&#xD;
      ventilator waveforms on the ability of health-care professionals to identify asynchronies has&#xD;
      not been tested so far. OBJECTIVES: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      detection of patient-ventilator asynchrony by health professionals through visual inspection&#xD;
      of the ventilator waveforms (conventional group) with the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      health professionals who have available, in addition to these ventilator waveforms, also the&#xD;
      estimated inspiratory muscle pressure curve (Pmus group). METHODS: Participantes will analyze&#xD;
      49 consecutive different scenarios of 1 minute of mechanical ventilation generated in a&#xD;
      simulator. A video with the 49 scenarios was produced by recording the ventilator screen in&#xD;
      high resolution to guarantee that all participants visualize the exact same waveforms.&#xD;
      Intensive care unit physicians and respiratory therapist will be invited to participate and&#xD;
      after the inclusion will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) the control group will&#xD;
      inspect pressure and flow curves and 2) the Pmus group will inspect pressure, flow, and Pmus&#xD;
      curves. Before the start of the study, all participants will have a 30-min training session&#xD;
      to homogenize their concepts on the definitions of the different types of asynchrony.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the participants will be randomized to the conventional group or Pmus group.&#xD;
      Participants will be designated to watch different sessions, in groups of at most 20&#xD;
      individuals, according to their randomization. In these sessions, recorded ventilator&#xD;
      waveforms will be projected to a large screen for 30 seconds. A still image containing a few&#xD;
      ventilatory cycles will remain visible for another 30 seconds when participants will have to&#xD;
      choose which asynchrony (if any) they can see on the screen. Sessions of the Pmus group will&#xD;
      display, in addition to pressure and flow, the estimated muscle pressure curves. The main&#xD;
      outcome is the asynchrony detection rate (sensitivity). The investigators will also compare&#xD;
      specificity, positive and negative predictive values for asynchrony detection. Statistical&#xD;
      significance will be set at an alpha level of 0.05. The sample size was estimated in 98&#xD;
      participants based on the expectation of a 10 percentage points difference in the sensitivity&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is instituted to promote an adequate gas&#xD;
      exchange, a reduction in the respiratory work and patient comfort. This can be offered in the&#xD;
      absence of patient effort through controlled modalities, in which the ventilator is the only&#xD;
      respiratory cycle control system, or in the presence of effort through assisted modalities,&#xD;
      in which the patient's respiratory cycle control is under ventilator influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data suggest that, during IMV, the diaphragm is subject to injury characterized by&#xD;
      damage into its fiber structure and function, known as ventilator-induced diaphragmatic&#xD;
      dysfunction (VIDD). This may be due to excessive reduction or lack of load imposed on the&#xD;
      musculature, an excessive overload of the respiratory musculature, or eccentric contraction&#xD;
      of the diaphragm characterized by diaphragmatic contraction during the expiratory phase of&#xD;
      the ventilator. VIDD covers from atrophy to rupture and remodeling of the muscle fiber&#xD;
      starting in a matter of hours in the controlled modalities and being more tenuous in the&#xD;
      assisted modalities, where muscle contraction is necessary. Its presence was associated with&#xD;
      worse outcomes such as the increase in IMV days and mortality in the unit intensive care&#xD;
      (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in order to reduce the risks inherent to VIDD and provide better outcomes for the&#xD;
      patient, the use of partial ventilatory support as early as possible through assisted&#xD;
      modalities is recommended. For this, there must be a synchronous interaction between the&#xD;
      pressure provided by the patient's respiratory musculature (Pmus) and the pressure provided&#xD;
      by the ventilator (Pvent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-ventilator asynchrony occurs when there is a mismatch between the patient and the&#xD;
      ventilator in terms of respiratory cycle time or due to an imbalance between patient demand&#xD;
      and ventilator supply. Minor asynchronies are inherent to system delays and considered&#xD;
      unavoidable. On the other hand, major asynchronies, considered avoidable can be associated&#xD;
      with poor ICU outcomes and are characterized by a mismatch between the patient's neural&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory times with the ventilator's mechanical insufflation and expiration&#xD;
      times. In the literature were described as risk factors for its development the increase or&#xD;
      reduction of the respiratory system elastance, the presence of expiratory flow limitation,&#xD;
      auto-PEEP, respiratory muscle weakness, hypoxemia, respiratory or metabolic alkalosis,&#xD;
      excessive use of sedation, in addition to the use of high support levels and high tidal&#xD;
      volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of asynchrony is considered frequent. It is estimated that all patients on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation present some type of asynchrony in up to 40% of respiratory cycles. In&#xD;
      general, they can be characterized by occurring in situations of excessive ventilatory&#xD;
      assistance and/or low respiratory drive and in situations of insufficient ventilatory&#xD;
      assistance and/or increased respiratory drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the asynchronies present in situations of excessive ventilatory assistance and/or low&#xD;
      respiratory drive are described: ineffective effort, auto-triggering, delayed cycling and&#xD;
      reverse triggering. Ineffective effort is trigger-related and described as an inspiratory&#xD;
      effort performed by the patient not followed by pressurization by the ventilator. As the&#xD;
      previous asynchrony, auto-triggering is also related to triggering and described as&#xD;
      pressurizing the ventilator without patient effort. Delayed cycling occurs when the duration&#xD;
      of pressurization performed by the ventilator is greater than the duration of the effort&#xD;
      performed by the patient. Finally, reverse trigger is defined by the patient's inspiratory&#xD;
      effort secondary to system pressurization, with a fixed delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In situations of insufficient ventilatory assistance and/or increased respiratory drive,&#xD;
      double triggering and premature cycling are described. Premature cycling occurs when the&#xD;
      ventilator's pressurization time is less than the patient's neural inspiratory time. In the&#xD;
      extreme, this asynchrony can lead to double triggering, characterized by two pressurizations&#xD;
      offered by the ventilator during a single patient effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although different types of asynchronies are described with clear definitions in relation to&#xD;
      Pmus and Pvent interaction, their correct identification is considered challenging, and their&#xD;
      misinterpretation can lead to inadequate adjustments of ventilatory parameters resulting in&#xD;
      perpetuation of the sedative cycle, diaphragmatic dysfunction and IMV. So far, the analysis&#xD;
      of bedside ventilator waveforms, the signal from diaphragm electrical activity (Eadi), the&#xD;
      use of the esophageal and/or transdiaphragmatic pressure signal have been proposed as a way&#xD;
      of detecting asynchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous analysis of airway flow and pressure curves over time during ventilatory support&#xD;
      was proposed to assess patient-ventilator synchrony, with the advantage of being&#xD;
      non-invasive, available and viable in clinical practice. However, the use of this analysis&#xD;
      requires expertise, is not automated and is associated with failure to identify types and&#xD;
      frequency of asynchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Eadi, as it portrays diaphragmatic activity, is considered reliable in relation to&#xD;
      the time and intensity of activation of this muscle. However, it requires the passage of a&#xD;
      specific nasogastric catheter, placed in the correct position and an appropriate ventilator&#xD;
      for reading, in addition to not detecting the action of other respiratory muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal and/or transdiaphragmatic pressure is considered the current gold standard in&#xD;
      estimating effort. Requires a specific catheter correctly located, in addition to an&#xD;
      appropriate monitor and system calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of asynchrony was associated with increased mechanical ventilation time,&#xD;
      morbidity, reduced hospital discharge rate and IMV free time in the survival analysis, when&#xD;
      compared to synchronous patients with the ventilator. Therefore, its correct detection is&#xD;
      necessary to optimize ventilatory adjustments and provide a better outcome for patients in&#xD;
      the ICU. Recently, the use of software has been proposed with the advantage of being a&#xD;
      real-time, automatic and continuous analysis. However these need further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification The patient-ventilator interaction is the result of two different pressure&#xD;
      systems, the Pmus performed by the patient through the activation of the respiratory muscles&#xD;
      and the pressure provided by the mechanical ventilator (Pvent). The tracings, provided by the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator, of pressure and flow are considered a graphical representation of the&#xD;
      interaction between Pmus and Pvent, and can exemplify the control of the respiratory cycle by&#xD;
      the patient under the influence of the ventilator. The use of these to identify asynchrony,&#xD;
      despite being visual and suitable for a logical interpretation, in clinical practice, proved&#xD;
      to be dependent on characteristics inherent to the observer, such as length of experience and&#xD;
      the presence of previous training. The average sensitivity to correctly identify asynchrony&#xD;
      using this interpretation technique was described as 28%, even considering only experienced&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FlexiMag Max ventilator (Magnamed, São Paulo, Brazil) provides in its interface&#xD;
      non-invasively estimated Pmus waveforms through an artificial intelligence algorithm. The&#xD;
      Pmus estimate, as it represents the effort performed by the patient both in time and in&#xD;
      intensity, when viewed simultaneously with the other waveforms displayed by the ventilator,&#xD;
      should provide a more representative graphic portrait of the patient-ventilator interaction.&#xD;
      However, the impact of using Pmus estimation on the observer's ability to correctly identify&#xD;
      asynchrony has not been studied so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The display of the estimated muscle pressure waveform performed by the patient,&#xD;
      simultaneously with the pressure, volume and airway flow waveforms over time, will help&#xD;
      healthcare professionals in intensive care units to identify patient-ventilator asynchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Primary Objective Compare the mean sensitivity and specificity of the detection of&#xD;
      patient-ventilator asynchrony by health professionals through visual inspection of the&#xD;
      pressure and flow tracings (conventional group) with the mean sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      the health professionals they have, in addition to these two tracings, also the estimated&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle pressure waveform (Pmus group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective Determine whether there is heterogeneity of effect with respect to length&#xD;
      of experience in intensive care (more or less than five years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Prospective, cluster-randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location Teaching and Research Institute (IEP) of the Sírio-Libanês Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Physiotherapists and Physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample For each participant, a sensitivity value defined as the relative frequency of correct&#xD;
      answers for all studied asynchronies will be calculated. After that, the average sensitivity&#xD;
      (or average hit percentage) as the average of all participants in each group will apply. The&#xD;
      sample size was defined based on a previous study, which had a mean sensitivity (or mean&#xD;
      percentage of correct answers) of 28.0% with a standard deviation of 15%. In order to have an&#xD;
      increase in the mean sensitivity of participants from 28 to 38% in the correct detection of&#xD;
      asynchrony, with a power of 90% and a two-tailed significance level of 0.05, it will be&#xD;
      necessary to include 49 participants per group, totaling 98 participants. The sample&#xD;
      calculation statistics site was used (http://calculoamostral.bauru.usp.br/calculoamostral/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Physicians and physiotherapists working in an intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Volunteers who do not respond to the asynchrony questions questionnaire&#xD;
      will be excluded from the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Individuals invited to participate in the study, after obtaining the informed&#xD;
      consent form, will be stratified by the period of experience in intensive care to be randomly&#xD;
      distributed by clusters in the Pmus or conventional group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a previous study, experienced professionals with experience in intensive care&#xD;
      and mechanical ventilation management for more than 5 years will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASL 5000 simulator FlexiMag Max mechanical ventilator (Magnamed, São Paulo, Brazil)&#xD;
      Auditorium of the Institute of Teaching and Research with a screen to enlarge the monitor&#xD;
      image Response printout per tracing Pens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected Variables The answers to the 49 questions displayed per participant will be&#xD;
      collected as a variable, which will be considered right or wrong according to the standard&#xD;
      answer elaborated by scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol The study will consist of a preparatory phase, to level participants in&#xD;
      defining the different types of asynchronies through preliminary training. In this, a class&#xD;
      on the subject will be given, designed for the study in question, synchronously using the&#xD;
      Zoom ® tool. The class will be held at 6 different times, with a maximum of 20 participants&#xD;
      per session, to allow at the end of each session to clarify doubts with the experts present&#xD;
      who will be made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of this step, participants will be cluster-randomized to the conventional&#xD;
      group or Pmus group. Randomization will be stratified by length of experience in intensive&#xD;
      care (less or more than five years). In the conventional group, two tracings will be&#xD;
      displayed (pressure and flow) while in the Pmus group, three tracings will be displayed&#xD;
      (pressure, flow and muscle pressure estimated through artificial intelligence algorithm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be exposed to the same simulated asynchrony scenarios using an active&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation simulator (ASL 5000, Ingmar, USA). A total of 49 scenarios will&#xD;
      include synchronous, ineffective effort, auto-triggering, double-triggering,&#xD;
      reverse-triggering, premature cycling, and late cycling situations. Groups of a maximum of 10&#xD;
      simultaneous participants will view the simulation of 49 scenarios in real time projected on&#xD;
      the screen of an auditorium. Each scenario will be visible for one minute. At the end of this&#xD;
      period, each participant must choose an alternative among the 7 available options that best&#xD;
      signal the situation observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scenario The scenarios will be performed simulating the patient-ventilator interaction using&#xD;
      the active servo lung 5000 (ASL 5000, IngMar Medical, Pittisburgh, Pennsylvania) connected to&#xD;
      the FlexiMag Max mechanical ventilator (Magmamed, São Paulo, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASL 5000 will play the role of the patient in the interaction, as this, through the&#xD;
      digital control of a piston, allows the simulation of different levels of patient efforts&#xD;
      under different mechanical conditions of the respiratory system. The 49 proposed scenarios&#xD;
      will be elaborated through the combination of effortlessness, low and high effort under the&#xD;
      condition of normal, restrictive and obstructive respiratory mechanics, defined by the&#xD;
      combination of resistance and compliance of the respiratory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the ventilator in the interaction will be played by the FlexiMag Max adjusted in&#xD;
      the assist-controlled ventilation modes for volume and pressure and in the spontaneous&#xD;
      pressure support mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interaction will include synchronous and asynchronous tracings. Asynchronies will be&#xD;
      simulated based on descriptions previously published in the literature, as shown in the table&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of asynchronies Definition Ineffective effort. Presence of effort (Pmus) without&#xD;
      ventilator triggering&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double triggering. Two ventilator cycles triggered by a single effort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auto triggering. None patient effort (Pmus) with ventilator triggering&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reverse triggering. Pmus follows the controlled (or auto-triggered) cycle with a fixed&#xD;
      frequency and delay. May or may not generate double cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature cycling. Inspiratory time too short compared to the patient, defined as cycling to&#xD;
      the expiratory phase before peak Pmus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed cycling. Inspiratory time too long in relation to the patient: defined as cycling to&#xD;
      the expiratory phase after the end of the effort (Pmus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual descriptive analysis will be performed. Variables with normal distribution will be&#xD;
      described using mean and standard deviation and compared between groups using the Student t&#xD;
      test. Variables with non-normal distribution will be described as median and interquartile&#xD;
      range and will be compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be described as absolute and relative frequency and compared using the chi-square test.&#xD;
      Data normality will be verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For each participant, means of&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of&#xD;
      asynchrony detection will be calculated. The means of these variables will be compared&#xD;
      between the participants of the conventional group and the Pmus group using the t test, or&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney test as indicated. It will be verified whether there is heterogeneity of&#xD;
      effect regarding previous experience in intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of statistical significance will be set at 0.05 two-tailed. The R 3.3.2 software&#xD;
      (www.r-project.org) will be used. The collected data will be stored in google forms - without&#xD;
      identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results If the hypothesis is confirmed, a superiority in the Pmus group compared to&#xD;
      the conventional group is expected, with a difference of 10 percentage points in the mean&#xD;
      sensitivity, in correctly identifying the different types of patient-ventilator asynchrony&#xD;
      per participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects The study will be submitted to the Ethics Committee of the institution where&#xD;
      it will be carried out. Participants will be included in the study after signing an informed&#xD;
      consent form. The study will be entirely simulation-based and will not involve patient&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and benefits A possible risk for research participants would be the breach of secrecy&#xD;
      and confidentiality in relation to the data collected, but the project team will act to&#xD;
      guarantee the security and confidentiality of the information. Also, if the volunteer may&#xD;
      feel uncomfortable answering questions about asynchrony, the project team will do their best&#xD;
      to avoid this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will provide the participant with knowledge about the current&#xD;
      definitions of patient-ventilator asynchrony. The data obtained may benefit professionals in&#xD;
      clinical practice and, consequently, patients who need invasive mechanical ventilatory&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
