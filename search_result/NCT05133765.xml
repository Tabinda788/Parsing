  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the established health benefits conveyed by physical activity for people with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (T1D), participation rates remain low, with fear of hypoglycaemia, lack of freedom&#xD;
      to engage in unplanned activities, and uncertainty in making appropriate adjustments to&#xD;
      insulin and nutritional therapy reported as the leading barriers to regular exercise&#xD;
      engagement. Indeed, the synergistic glucose lowering effects of peripheral hyperinsulinaemia&#xD;
      and exercising muscle tissue accentuate the risk of exercise-related hypoglycaemia for&#xD;
      individuals with T1D, particularly if performed post-prandially. Hence, the introduction of&#xD;
      commercially available artificial pancreas systems, also known as ''advanced&#xD;
      hybrid-closed-loop'' (AHCL) systems, that regulate insulin rates with minimal user&#xD;
      interaction constitute compelling therapeutic aids with clinically relevant potential.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, we know little about their safe and efficacious integration around dynamic&#xD;
      physical exercise. Nor do we know how alterations in carbohydrate fueling strategies around&#xD;
      exercise effect subsequent glucose trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to 1) compare the efficacy of an AHCL system versus usual care insulin pump&#xD;
      therapy, with carbohydrates taken before or during exercise, in optimising TIR around dynamic&#xD;
      physical exercise and 2) explore the influence of carbohydrate intake before versus during&#xD;
      exercise on the metabolomic, hormonal and physiological responses to exercise.&#xD;

      Following successful completion of a screening visit, participants will attend the laboratory&#xD;
      to complete 3 experimental visits during which they will undertake a 45-minute bout of&#xD;
      moderate intensity continuous exercise on a bicycle ergometer at ~60% of the individualised&#xD;
      VȮ2max. Prior to commencing exercise, participants will consume a standardised low-glycaemic&#xD;
      index, carbohydrate-based meal (equating to 0.75g.CHO.kg.bm-1) with, or without, a 25%&#xD;
      reduction in their meal-time insulin dose as well as with carbohydrates before or during&#xD;
      exercise (according to the randomisation). Venous blood glucose sampling will be taken in&#xD;
      15-minute intervals leading into and after exercise with 5-minute intervals performed during&#xD;
      exercise. Samples will be used to retrospectively cross-compare the metabolic, hormonal, and&#xD;
      physiological responses between visits. Visits 1 &amp; 2 will be separated by ≥14 days to ensure&#xD;
      adequate familiarisation with the AHCL system whilst visits 2 &amp; 3 will be separated by&#xD;
      ≥3days. Each participant will undertake 1 screening and 3 experimental visits equating to a&#xD;
      total of 80 study visits.&#xD;
