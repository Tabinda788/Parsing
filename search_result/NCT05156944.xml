  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this monocentric, block-randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group study&#xD;
      is to assess whether patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a fall within&#xD;
      the past 7 days would benefit from a physiotherapy intervention, as compared to patients&#xD;
      without physiotherapy intervention at the time of ED presentation. Primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess &quot;fear of falling&quot; 7 days after ED presentation with versus without a&#xD;
      physiotherapy intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in short International Falls efficacy scale (sFES-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 and Day 7 ± 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the fear of falling between groups at day 7, measured by the short International Falls efficacy scale (sFES-I). It is a 16-item questionnaire where individuals are instructed to score their concern of falling during an activity on a 4 point Likert scale with 1 as not concerned at all and 4 as very concerned. The item scores are summed up to obtain a total, with higher the score, higher being the concern for falling.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 and Day 42 ± 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates: Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0, Day 7 ± 3 days, Day 21 ± 3 days, Day 42 ± 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain ('0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;))</description>
