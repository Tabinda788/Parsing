  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CUV156 study will evaluate the safety of afamelanotide in XP-C patients, as well as the&#xD;
      drug's ability to assist reparative processes following ultraviolet (UV) provoked DNA damage&#xD;
      of the skin. It will assess whether SCENESSEÂ® increases the amount of UV light needed to&#xD;
      cause DNA damage of skin cells, as well as the extent of skin repair before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
