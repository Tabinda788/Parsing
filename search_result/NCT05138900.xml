  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a single treatment of targeted radiation (called&#xD;
      SBRT or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) can be as safe and effective as multiple doses&#xD;
      of radiation in patients with central non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an ECOG Performance Status of â‰¤ 2. Refer to Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have histologically proven diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage cT1-3N0M0 with tumor size &lt; 6 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy allowed but no systemic therapy 4-6 weeks prior to stereotactic&#xD;
             body radiation therapy SBRT (see exclusion criteria), during SBRT, or 2 weeks after&#xD;
             SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumors located within 2 cm in all directions of any mediastinal critical structures,&#xD;
             including the bronchial tree, esophagus, heart, brachial plexus, major vessels, spinal&#xD;
             cord, phrenic nerve, and recurrent laryngeal nerve, as defined by the International&#xD;
             Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) (27).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is considered to be either medically or surgically inoperable by&#xD;
             physicians, or participant declines surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive&#xD;
             methods (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an&#xD;
             Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed&#xD;
             consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (including the&#xD;
             inability to cooperate with any aspect of SBRT such as the inability to lie still and&#xD;
             breathe reproducibly)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation to the volume of lung or mediastinum currently involved by tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plan for the patient to receive other concomitant antineoplastic therapy (including&#xD;
             standard fractionated radiation, chemotherapy, biological therapy, vaccine therapy,&#xD;
             and surgery) while on this protocol, except at disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the participant an unsuitable&#xD;
             candidate to receive SBRT&#xD;
