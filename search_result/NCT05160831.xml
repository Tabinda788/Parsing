      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of human umbilical cord&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell injection in the articular cavity to treat moderate to severe knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA), and whether it can achieve articular cartilage regeneration, reduction&#xD;
      of joint pain, and restoration of joint function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are more than 100 types of arthritis, and the most common ones are rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). The main cause of its pathogenesis is the compensatory&#xD;
      hyperplasia of the articular cartilage caused by the body's degenerative changes, which will&#xD;
      eventually cause the joint to partially or completely lose its function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few decades, continuous efforts have been made to treat OA. The treatment of OA&#xD;
      changes with the development of the patient's condition. At present, there are many diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment options for knee OA, including conservative treatment and surgical treatment.&#xD;
      There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to postpone or terminate the course of OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell therapy for OA has developed rapidly in recent years and has received widespread&#xD;
      attention. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with potential of&#xD;
      self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Stem cells are extracted from the patient's&#xD;
      body and then implanted back. Their ability of regeneration and reproduction can fill the&#xD;
      damaged cartilage tissue, so as to achieve an effective treatment of the joint damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of human umbilical cord&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell injection in the articular cavity to treat moderate to severe knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA), and whether it can achieve articular cartilage regeneration, reduction&#xD;
      of joint pain, and restoration of joint function.&#xD;
