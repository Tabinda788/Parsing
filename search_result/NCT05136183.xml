  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis and septic shock are major causes of ICU admission worldwide. Despite recent advances&#xD;
      in treatment, including targeted resuscitation and timely use of antimicrobial agents,&#xD;
      mortality of ICU patients with septic shock remains steadily high. Especially in those&#xD;
      requiring high dosage of vasopressors, whose 28-day mortality rate could reach 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of septic shock emphasizes on the role of dysregulated host immune&#xD;
      response towards inciting microbes, producing excessive inflammatory cytokines which lead to&#xD;
      tissue damage and subsequent organ failures. Multiple therapies targeting the overwhelming&#xD;
      inflammatory response in patients with septic shock have been studied (ref). While some&#xD;
      showed promising results in modulating inflammation in observational studies (ref), none&#xD;
      other than systemic corticosteroids lead to better clinical outcomes in the randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies. The reasons for their failures are the complexity of the inflammation&#xD;
      cascades, where treatments specifically targeting parts of the process may not be able to&#xD;
      achieve meaningful effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal blood purification therapy is an adjunctive treatment option more extensively&#xD;
      studied over the last decade. By passing patients' blood or plasma through specifically&#xD;
      developed absorber, various inflammatory cytokines are absorbed to resins inside the devices&#xD;
      and removed from the circulation. Decreasing levels of inflammatory cytokines may&#xD;
      subsequently attenuate systemic inflammation leading to shock reversal and better survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA-330 disposable hemoperfusion cartridge (Jafron®, China) is an absorber targeting&#xD;
      hyper-inflammatory states including septic shock. It is designed to nonspecifically absorb&#xD;
      molecules with molecular weight 10-60 kilo-Dalton, making it effective for removing various&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentially modulating the inflammatory cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous randomized study in patients with sepsis compared between the add-on 3 daily session&#xD;
      of hemoperfusion with HA-330 adsorber and the standard therapy . .Circulating interleukin-6&#xD;
      and interleukin-8 levels of patients underwent hemoperfusion significantly reduced after two&#xD;
      sessions when compared to baseline. Their values on day 3 were also significantly lower than&#xD;
      those of the control group. Adjunctive hemoperfusion were associated with lower ICU&#xD;
      mortality, butno significant difference in hospital and 28-day mortality between the two&#xD;
      groups(ref). However, approximately 50% of enrolled patients had sepsis without shock.&#xD;
      Generalization of the findings to more severe cohorts of septic shock patients are therefore&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with septic shock have higher cytokines level than septic patients without shock.&#xD;
      Hence, they are theoretically more likely to benefit from therapies aiming to reduce cytokine&#xD;
      levels. We hypothesize that adjunctive hemoperfusion with HA-330 adsorber would be associated&#xD;
      with better outcomes in a more severe group of patients with septic shock.&#xD;
