  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no therapies to improve the chances of recovering enough kidney function&#xD;
      to come off of dialysis after severe acute kidney injury. It is not known if current routine&#xD;
      outpatient dialysis treatments are optimized to maximize the chances of recovery. The purpose&#xD;
      of this pilot study is to see if we can feasibly and safely provide several changes to the&#xD;
      way that dialysis is provided in outpatient dialysis centers which may improve the chances of&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;

    <description>During the 90-day study period, participants will be prescribed outpatient hemodialysis with cooled dialysate (35-36°C), high sodium dialysate (145 mmol/L), a high ultrafiltration hold threshold (systolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg; ultrafiltration hold threshold will not be applied in participants with baseline systolic blood pressure &lt; 120 mmHg), and high dose diuretics (160 mg oral furosemide twice daily) to be taken every day at home will also be prescribed. Dialysis will be weaned according to an active weaning protocol.</description>
