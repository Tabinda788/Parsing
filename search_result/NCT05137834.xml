  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative&#xD;
      exercise with a &quot;peanut ball&quot; after total knee replacement, on pain reduction, intake of pain&#xD;
      killers, knee function, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be included in the study. Each week is randomized to be either &quot;peanut&#xD;
      ball&quot; och standard exercise week, with all patients during that week receiving the same&#xD;
      treatment. Thus, depending on what week the patients are operated they will be mobilized with&#xD;
      postoperative exercise with a &quot;peanut ball&quot; or to a standard exercise program (no peanut&#xD;
      ball) 3-5 times/day for 6 weeks. The inclusion criteria will be all patients with primary&#xD;
      osteoarthritis planed for total knee replacement at Skånes university hospital and the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are patients that do not understand the Swedish language, patients with&#xD;
      dementia, revisions surgery, and unicompartmental knee replacement. Pain, intake of&#xD;
      painkillers, range of movement, health-related quality of life, and the function will be&#xD;
      assessed before surgery, at the ward, at 2 weeks follow-up visit, at 3-month follow-up, and&#xD;
      at 1 year.&#xD;
