  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      multicomponent technology-supported care delivery intervention trial in 110 older patients&#xD;
      with hematologic malignancies [acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM), and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)] receiving outpatient&#xD;
      chemotherapy on treatment-related toxicities, patient-reported outcomes, healthcare&#xD;
      utilization, and inflammatory and epigenetic markers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to younger adults, older adults with cancer are more likely to have age-related&#xD;
      vulnerabilities such as functional impairment and co-existing medical conditions. They are&#xD;
      also often on many medications. As a result, older adults are more likely to experience&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicities. These toxicities can lead to increased healthcare utilization&#xD;
      (e.g., hospitalization, emergency room visits), decreased quality of life and functional&#xD;
      status, and reduced survival. In addition, a disproportionate number of older adults live in&#xD;
      rural areas which often limit access to healthcare. Therefore, there is a need to better&#xD;
      support older adults with hematologic malignancies during the course of their treatment to&#xD;
      decrease treatment-related toxicities so they can continue to receive treatment. The proposed&#xD;
      study will investigate whether digital health technologies can support older adults in&#xD;
      various aspects of their cancer care.&#xD;

    <description>Measured using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events or CTCAE v5.0 and operationalized based on proportion of patients with grade 3-5 non-hematologic treatment-related toxicity for AML, MDS, and DLBCL or grade 2-5 non-hematologic treatment-related toxicity for MM</description>

    <time_frame>4-5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Healthcare utilization such as hospitalization and emergency room visits in the first 4-5 months will be collected from medical chart review. These will be presented as proportions and count.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference between experimental and active comparator arms - Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>4-5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life, measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-G) scale. It consists of 27 items divided into 4 subscales: physical well-being (PWB), social well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), and functional well-being (FWB). The score for each item ranges from 0-4. After reversing the scoring of negatively worded items, all the scores are summated. A higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference between experimental and active comparator arms - Patient-reported treatment-related toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>4-5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported treatment-related toxicity as measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE). We selected 22 symptoms commonly experienced by older adults with hematologic malignancies. Questions ask about frequency, severity, and interference with daily activities (each question has 5 response options). We will convert these response options to 0-5 and sum up the scores, higher score indicates worse severity and interference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference between experimental and active comparator arms - Functional Status</measure>
    <time_frame>4-5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional status, measured using the instrumental activities of daily living subscale of the Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire: Older American Resources and Services (OARS). The IADL subscale consists of seven questions rated on a three-point Likert scale. It measures the degree to which an activity can be performed independently. A higher score indicates better functional status</description>
