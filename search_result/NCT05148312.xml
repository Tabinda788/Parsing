      This is a randomized, open label, single-center, single-dose, four-period crossover clinical&#xD;
      study to assess the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of a budesonide inhalation solution&#xD;
      (AQ001S) compared to a budesonide inhalation suspension (comparator) in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Three (3) different AQ001S concentrations (i.e. 0.125 mg/2 mL, 0.250 mg/2mL and 0.500 mg/2&#xD;
      mL) will be compared to budesonide inhalation suspension 1.0 mg/2 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty (20) male and female healthy volunteers, from 18 to 60 years old, must complete the&#xD;
      study. The study drug will be administered by nebulization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary PK objective is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AQ001S&#xD;
      inhalation solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety objective is to assess the safety of AQ001S inhalation solution.&#xD;

One single dose of study medication on the first day of the treatment period, followed by&#xD;
Minimum washout period of 3 days, i.e. minimum 72 hours between two drug administrations&#xD;
The pharmacokinetics profile of budesonide in plasma, will be evaluated through pharmacokinetics parameters, calculated for each single dose, and based on 17 timepoints from 0 to 24h.</intervention_model_description>
