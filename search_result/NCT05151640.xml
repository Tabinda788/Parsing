    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between changes from&#xD;
      baseline to 52 weeks in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) [% pred.] and changes from baseline to 52&#xD;
      weeks in dyspnea score [points] or cough score [points] as measured with the living with&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis (L-PF) questionnaire over 52 weeks of nintedanib treatment in patients&#xD;
      suffering from chronic fibrosing Interstitial lung disease (ILD) with a progressive phenotype&#xD;
      (excluding idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;living with pulmonary fibrosis&quot; (L-PF) questionnaire for dyspnea/cough symptom score consists of 44 items divided into two modules: Symptoms (23 items) and Impacts (21 items). The Symptoms module assesses shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough and fatigue over the last 24 hours. The Impacts module assesses multiple aspects of health related quality of life (HRQoL) over the last 7 days. Symptoms and Impacts scores are used to calculate a total score.&#xD;
•Items in both modules have response options on a five-option numeric rating score with an anchor of 0 &quot;Not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;Extremely&quot;. Overall scores range from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a greater impairment.</description>
