  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to explore the safety and tolerability as well as diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      68Ga-FAPI-46 for different FAP-expressing tumor entities by PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not offer any treatment for patients with FAP-expressing carcinomas;&#xD;
      therefore, patients will be offered state of the art therapeutic options. Routine surgery&#xD;
      will be performed within 8 weeks after 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET.&#xD;

    <description>68Ga-FAPI-46 is a radiotracer that binds with high affinity to Fibroblast Activating Protein (FAP). FAP is physiologically expressed in many tissues during embryonic development, but in adults it is expressed only in the context of wound healing, fibrotic processes, and the stroma of many malignancies. Therefore, the study seeks to validate if 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET could be established as a diagnositc tool to detect solid tumors.</description>

&#xD;
          8. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable&#xD;
             of becoming pregnant, are not allowed to participate in this study, unless they are&#xD;

             Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True sexual abstinence: defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse, when&#xD;
                  this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
                  abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods),&#xD;
                  declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to IMP, and withdrawal are&#xD;

                  system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study. Women are considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of&#xD;
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms), or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
             with serum folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40mIU/mL or have had surgical&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least six weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse during the interventional&#xD;
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent&#xD;
             delivery of the study compound via seminal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. QTcF &gt;470 msec for females and QTcF &gt;450 msec for males on screening electrocardiogram&#xD;
             (ECG) or history of congenital long QT syndrome.&#xD;

         12. Known or expected hypersensitivity to 68Ga-68-FAPI-46 or any of the relevant&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
