    <textblock>
      CHANCES-IPC 2021-008 is First In Human, Phase I, multicenter, European study evaluating an&#xD;
      anti-CD73, IPH5301 in advanced and/or metastatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in two parts, Part I- Dose escalation: This part aims to identify&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IPH5301 agent in monotherapy and recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) for future trials, followed by a safety expansion study part cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II- Expansion cohort: A total of 12 HER2+ cancer patients, respectively 6 breast cancer&#xD;
      patients and 6 gastric cancer patients, is planned to be enrolled into the next expansion&#xD;
      cohort to select a recommended dose of IPH5301 to be administered in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and trastuzumab for evaluation in future trials with selected advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
