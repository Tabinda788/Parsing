  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study. During the study, children and adolescents (ages&#xD;
      â‰¥ 5 to &lt; 16) will be followed post administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection site (local), systemic reaction, and unsolicited adverse event data will be&#xD;
      assessed on vaccination day and during the 7 days following each vaccination using either&#xD;
      identical web-based or paper diaries, depending on study participant preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Duke University, Cincinnati's Children Hospital, and Kaiser Permanente Northern&#xD;
      California, serum samples will be collected for assessment of antibody titers to COVID-19.&#xD;
      Each participant will have baseline (within 3 days of vaccination) serologies obtained and&#xD;
      immunogenicity assessment at 28 (+7) days after each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed for 180 days after each dose for serious adverse events and&#xD;
      adverse events of special interest.&#xD;
