  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to measure alterations in anxiety and brain activity&#xD;
      associated with the use of an approved health device called Transauricular Vagal Nerve&#xD;
      Stimulation (TaVNS) in distressed health care workers. The Investigators will be using&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (or fMRI) to measure changes in each subject's brain&#xD;
      function during the use of VNS. This study is designed to allow researchers to understand the&#xD;
      changes in cerebral (brain) activity that occur when a subject uses VNS. Thus, the overall&#xD;
      goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the ability of the TaVNS system to reduce distress&#xD;
      and change neurophysiology among health care providers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of up to 90 distressed health care providers will be screened for this study. From&#xD;
      that group, the researchers plan to enroll enough subjects to have 80 fully complete the&#xD;
      study. The 90 screened subjects will allow for screen failures and subjects who withdraw&#xD;
      early from the study. All subjects will receive an initial evaluation using symptom&#xD;
      questionnaires (these will include the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom&#xD;
      Inventory-18 which is the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes as measured by the Maslach&#xD;
      Burnout Scale, GAD-7 (anxiety), PHQ-9 (depression), the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale-25&#xD;
      (CD-RISC), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and physiological measures that will consist&#xD;
      of heart rate variability (HRV) and galvanic skin resistance (GSR). Subjects will then be&#xD;
      randomized to either the 3 month TaVNS program or the 3 month waitlist group. At one month,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a follow up request to complete the same questionnaires as in the&#xD;
      initial evaluation for an interim evaluation. Then after receiving the TaVNS program or being&#xD;
      in the waitlist control group for 3 months, the subjects will have a repeat of the&#xD;
      questionnaires and physiological testing. Subjects in the waitlist group will then be&#xD;
      provided the TaVNS program to be used for 3 months. This group will be asked to complete one&#xD;
      final set of symptom questionnaires at the completion of using the TaVNS program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two subgroups will be included in fMRI scans performed during the initial evaluation period&#xD;
      (pre) and at 3 months (post). Subgroup I of 30 subjects (15 in TaVNS group and 15 in waitlist&#xD;
      control) will undergo fMRI scans that will include structural imaging and functional imaging&#xD;
      with Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Imaging (BOLD) scan and arterial spin labeling (ASL) scans.&#xD;
      Specifically, during the ASL scans (each approximately 5 minutes long), a script of the&#xD;
      subject's most distressing recollection(s) will be read from an audio file script while each&#xD;
      subject is in the MRI scanner. Changes in brain function will be compared between the stress&#xD;
      script and a neutral script (that describes a typical morning waking up). This same imaging&#xD;
      protocol, which takes a total of about 45 minutes, will be performed initially and then after&#xD;
      the 3 month TaVNS program or the waitlist period. All scans will be co-registered and&#xD;
      comparable slices of the cerebral cortex will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup II will consist of 10 study subjects all receiving the TaVNS program who will&#xD;
      undergo fMRI initially and then again at 3 months. This group will be scanned while wearing&#xD;
      the TaVNS system (a special one that can be used in the MRI environment) and the fMRI will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the direct effects of the TaVNS while turned on and off in the scanner. The&#xD;
      imaging protocol will take a total of about 45 minutes. In addition to the 10 study subjects,&#xD;
      the researchers will also plan to recruit 10 healthy controls with no reports of&#xD;
      psychological distress (i.e. less than 2 on the SUDS). These 10 healthy controls will have&#xD;
      the TaVNS placed while receiving two fMRI scans approximately 3 months apart. These control&#xD;
      subjects will be used to compare the subgroup of study subjects to ensure that any changes&#xD;
      are not associated with test-retest effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subgroups will be filled with eligible and interested subjects. If the subject is&#xD;
      interested and is able to undergo fMRI scanning, the subject will be placed in Subgroup I&#xD;
      until enrollment is filled and then subsequently subjects will be enrolled into Subgroup II&#xD;
      until enrollment is filled. Any eligible subject that is unwilling or unable to undergo fMRI&#xD;
      scanning will be placed in the general, non-scanning group. Once the two subgroups are&#xD;
      filled, any remaining eligible subjects will be placed in the general, non-scanning group.&#xD;

They are initially sprayed once with a small amount of saline that is also provided as part of the TaVNS materials. Once the ear buds are placed in each ear, the test subject will start a preprogramed session of vibrations that will stimulate the vagus nerve. The session will last for 15 minutes and then the subject will take the ear buds out and clean them. They will use the TaVNS program once a day for 3 months.</description>
