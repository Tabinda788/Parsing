  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The superior hypogastric plexus (SHP) is a complex nervous collection located at the&#xD;
      lumbosacral region below the level of the aortic bifurcation at the level of the lower third&#xD;
      of the fifth lumbar vertebral body and upper third of the first sacral vertebral body at the&#xD;
      sacral promontory Neurolytic agents, such as alcohol and phenol have been used to ablate&#xD;
      peripheral nerves to treat pain and spasticity . These agents were nonspecific for neuronal&#xD;
      tissue and complications have been seen involving damage to surrounding soft tissue (skin,&#xD;
      muscle, vascular) and pain on alcohol injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine has been demonstrated to be neurotoxic in high concentrations at 10% and can be&#xD;
      used as a neurolytic agent with no effect on motor function, muscle state, or surrounding&#xD;
      tissue rather than other neurolytic.&#xD;

      Every Patient will be in supine Trendelenburg position, IV access in case of adverse events&#xD;
      and for moderate sedation if needed (for patient comfort, sever anxiety or needle phobia, or&#xD;
      history of vagal events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be completed under aseptic precautions. The division of abdominal aorta&#xD;
      into common iliac arteries will be identified by using longitudinal sonography (Lumify L12-4&#xD;
      Linear Array Transducer 12 to 4 MHz extended operating frequency range, 34mm footprint and&#xD;
      aperture size, and scan depth of up to 12cm. Imaging modes include 2D, color Doppler, and&#xD;
      M-mode), and the body of the fifth (5th) Lumbar vertebra will be identified by placing the&#xD;
      transducer transversely. A skin wheal will be raised with subcutaneous infiltration with 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine solution nearly 3-4 cm below the umbilicus. A 15-cm Long 22-G Chiba needle will be&#xD;
      used with out of plane technique, and the needle will be advanced under USG-guidance to reach&#xD;
      the anterior- most point of the fifth Lumber vertebral body avoiding the vascular structures.&#xD;
      The needle will be withdrawn nearly 1-2 mm after hitting the vertebral body to avoid&#xD;
      injecting the drug into the periosteum. After confirming a negative aspiration of blood,&#xD;
      known amount of neurolytic agent according to the grouping will be injected for the&#xD;
      neurolysis of superior hypogastric plexus. The uniform spread of the drug will be confirmed&#xD;
      under real-time sonography. Vital Sign parameters will be recorded during and after the&#xD;
      procedure, during which patients remained fully awake&#xD;
