  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, single-blinded comparative 3-arm clinical study. This&#xD;
      clinical study is designed to compare the efficacy of the ArchSinus stent to the Propel stent&#xD;
      (Intersect ENT), and to NasoPore (Stryker) in preventing post-FESS middle turbinate&#xD;
      lateralization 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months post FESS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 chronic rhinosinusitis patients, that met the inclusion criteria will undergo bilateral&#xD;
      FESS and subsequent bilateral placement of the ArchSinus into the randomized ethmoid sinus&#xD;
      cavity and NasoPore / Propel into the other ethmoid sinus cavity. Comparative treatment sides&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned; 50 sinuses treated with ArchSinus stent, 25 sinus treated with&#xD;
      Propel stent, 25 sinuses treated with Nasopore. Standard Propel implant and 4cm whole&#xD;
      NasoPore will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ArchSinus stent will be removed 2 weeks (13-15 days) post FESS. Propel will be removed as&#xD;
      necessary 2 weeks (13-15 days) post FESS. NasoPore arm will be debrided as necessary 2 weeks&#xD;
      (13-15 days) post-FESS. Prior to removal / debridement procedures, the patients will be&#xD;
      blindfolded, to keep them blinded for the treatment type on each side of their nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up at 2, 6 and 12 weeks and 12 months post FESS and examined&#xD;
      endoscopically. The endoscopic videos will be analyzed by independent pannel of 3 ENT&#xD;
      surgeons, blinded to the treatment type, to assess middle turbinate lateralization on a&#xD;
      4-point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan will be performed pre-FESS and 12 weeks after the operation, to assess middle&#xD;
      turbinate lateralization, as demonstrated by percent change in middle meatus (MM) area&#xD;
      pre-FESS and 12 weeks after the surgery. Inflammatory mucosal thickening will be quantified&#xD;
      using the Zinreich staging system. CT scans will be analyzed blindly by Medical Metrics Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic improvement will be analyzed weekly within 3 months follow up, using&#xD;
      Side-specific Nasal SNOT-22 questioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient symptomatic relief during the implantation time will be analyzed 2 weeks post FESS,&#xD;
      with Side-specific Nasal SNOT-22 questioner.&#xD;
