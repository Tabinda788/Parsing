      The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy and safety of toripalimab combined with&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the treatment of oligometastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy has been widely used for the treatment of relapsed or metastatic nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma. However, the long-term survival and quality of life of patients was still&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. In this prospective, multicenter, single arm study, the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of toripalimab combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of oligometastatic nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma is determined.&#xD;
