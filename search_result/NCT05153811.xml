  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators will implement innovations to extend use of Contingency&#xD;
      Management (CM) to facilitate alcohol use reduction among people living with HIV (PLWH). The&#xD;
      investigators' approach to extending CM will use mobile health (mHealth) tools including a&#xD;
      smartphone breathalyzer device with accompanying app and a wrist worn alcohol biosensor.&#xD;
      Participants will be engaged in mobile facilitated CM for 30-60 days with follow-up out to 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>Develop a gamified mHealth application to reduce alcohol consumption. In one of the intervention arms participants will engage with a novel, mobile application aimed at reducing their alcohol consumption. Alcohol use, which is monitored with a biosensor, will be compared against the alcohol use of those in the other intervention arms.</description>

             day for women) at least twice or report any 7 day period at hazardous drinking levels&#xD;
             (greater than 14 drinks for men, greater than 7 drinks for women) in the past 30 days&#xD;
             based on responses on the Timeline Followback (TLFB; Sobell and Sobell, 2003)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fluency in English&#xD;

             alcohol use on fewer days than at baseline after that&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to use smartphone applications and biosensor devices (i.e., breathalyzer&#xD;
             device and wrist sensor) for alcohol use reduction purposes in the study. If&#xD;
             participants do not have a compatible smartphone to use, they will be loaned one by&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;

             Institute Withdrawal Scale (CIWA; Sullivan et al., 1989) or lifetime history of&#xD;
             medically assisted detoxification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported consumption of over 300 drinks in the past 30 days on the TLFB Contact&#xD;

             in-person screening appointment. After participants blow their first positive BrAC,&#xD;
             they will be allowed to reschedule and participate at another time, however if they&#xD;
             blow a second positive BrAC, they will be excluded from this study and offered&#xD;
             referrals for alcohol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine screen indicating recent opioid use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently seeking or past-12-month history of inpatient or intensive treatment for&#xD;
             addictive behaviors&#xD;
