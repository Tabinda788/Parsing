    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring the acceptability of an intervention. Acceptability refers to the perception that a given treatment is agreeable or satisfactory. The total score ranges from 4 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher acceptability ratings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Ratings on the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring the appropriateness of an intervention. Appropriateness refers to the perceived fit or relevance of an intervention. The total score ranges from 4 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher appropriateness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanisms of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants answered questions relating to each module's mechanism of change on a 7-point Likert Scale, from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;.&#xD;
Specifically, we asked participants:&#xD;
How capable they feel about managing negative thoughts; If they will intentionally spend time doing activities they enjoy; If they will notice and appreciate good things; If they will</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We asked participants three items to assess secondary control (Weisz et al., 2010). The items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;Very false&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Very true&quot;).&#xD;
The three items are:&#xD;
When something bad happens, I can find a way to think about it that makes me feel better.&#xD;
After a really hard day, I can make myself feel better by remembering some good things that happened.&#xD;
When bad things happen to me that I can't control, there are lots of things I can do to feel better.&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater secondary control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring positive affect and negative affect. Scores on the positive affect subscale range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect. Scores on the negative affect subscale range from 10-50, with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale-4</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring perceived stress. Scores range from 0-16, with higher scores indicating greater stress.</description>
