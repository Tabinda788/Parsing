  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGG) (or WHO grade II gliomas) are rare tumors, with an incidence&#xD;
      estimated at 1/105 person-year. DLGG are characterized by a continuous growth and an&#xD;
      unavoidable anaplastic transformation. DLGG malignant progression is classically&#xD;
      characterized by a continuum, from grade II to grade III or IV tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the histomolecular diagnosis of lower grade gliomas (that is, grade II and III&#xD;
      gliomas) is achieved on tumor samples obtained from surgical resection or biopsy. Indeed,&#xD;
      whereas brain MRI is often suggestive of DLGG, there is a need for a histological&#xD;
      confirmation of diagnosis prior to any medical treatment. Moreover, MRI features to not&#xD;
      always accurately predict the tumor grade, with grade II tumor presenting with contrast&#xD;
      enhancement or non-enhancing authentic grade III tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this setting, the value of liquid biopsy (in blood or cerebrospinal fluid CSF) as a&#xD;
      non-invasive, disease-associated biomarker has gained interest in the past decade, either at&#xD;
      tumor diagnosis or to monitor tumor evolution in order to guide patient management and to&#xD;
      detect changes of molecular features over time. While extracranial metastasis of glioma&#xD;
      rarely occurs, recent reports suggest the possible presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)&#xD;
      in blood of high-grade glioma patients. Beside CTCs, other circulating biomarkers have been&#xD;
      recently investigated in glioma, including circulating tumor DNA, microRNA or tumor-educated&#xD;
      platelet (TEP) RNA. Some of these techniques allow genome-wide characterization of RNA/DNA&#xD;
      contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these studies are all small exploratory studies that have mainly included&#xD;
      glioblastoma (grade IV glioma) patients rather than lower-grade gliomas, or glioma patients&#xD;
      with no precision on tumor grade. Moreover, some of these studies analyzed samples performed&#xD;
      after the patient received a medical oncological treatment (chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
      therapy). They advocate for the search of a circulating signature that would not be&#xD;
      restricted to biomarkers directly derived from the tumor but include markers induced at a&#xD;
      distance by the tumor. Indeed, slow-growing DLGG are likely to induce a systemic reaction to&#xD;
      allow, for many years, an immuno-tolerance of the tumor. This reaction could have an impact&#xD;
      on peripheral blood cells, including their RNA content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim at conducting an exploratory study in DLGG patients to&#xD;
      explore the value of several blood-based biomarkers for the disease diagnosis and/or&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;

      following groups : patients with low-grade glioma, patients with high-grade glioma and&#xD;
      patients undergoing neurosurgery for a non-tumor disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits in this study are as follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Visit (V0) : 2 days (+/- 2 days) before brain surgery&#xD;
