  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One common side effect of cisplatin chemotherapy is ototoxicity. The drugs sodium thiosulfate&#xD;
      and mannitol may protect against cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Specifically, sodium&#xD;
      thiosulfate has been found to protect the cells in the inner ear, and may therefore prevent&#xD;
      hearing loss. Mannitol can help sodium thiosulfate enter the inner ear, and ponteially&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of sodium thiosulfate. This study aims to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      sodium thiosulfate and mannitol to reduce the hearing impairment caused by cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II clinical trial: with 1:1 randomization between cisplatin alone, and&#xD;
      cisplatin + sodium thiosulfate and mannitol. Participants will first be recruited into a&#xD;
      2-year pilot feasibility study of 24 patients (12 in each arm). The pilot study will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the feasibility of the trial as defined by the following factors:&#xD;
      treatment outcomes, occurrence of adverse events, logistics of treatment delivery, as well as&#xD;
      dropout and recruitment rates. The results from the pilot study will support the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy, and effectiveness of the sodium thiosuldate and mannitol treatment, confirm&#xD;
      feasibility using the factors mentioned above, and serve as an earlier-phase developmental&#xD;
      function to enhance the probability of success of the subsequent clinical trial. Participants&#xD;
      will complete various pre-treatment hearing tests. Participants will receive sodium&#xD;
      thiosulfate and mannitol 4 - 8 hours following chemotherapy treatment. The control group will&#xD;
      not receive the experimental intervention. Follow-up hearing tests will be performed at&#xD;
      select time intervals following completion of their cancer treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure of this study will be a comparison of hearing loss between the control and experimental groups. More specifically, each ear will be scored as having hearing loss if there is a greater than 10dB hearing loss in three contiguous frequencies. This will be measured via threshold hearing tests.</description>
