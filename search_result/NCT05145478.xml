    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to obtain effect size data on the use of Shockwave&#xD;
      Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) technology in calcified common femoral lesions in patients&#xD;
      with peripheral artery disease for a series of endpoints, including target lesion&#xD;
      revascularization and health status, to enable future planning of comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the generic health status outcomes and&#xD;
      efficacy and safety outcomes following use of the Shockwave Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL)&#xD;
      technology in calcified common femoral lesions in patients with PAD seen in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main testable hypothesis is that the use of IVL is associated with a health status&#xD;
      improvement that is equal or higher than the threshold of a minimally clinically important&#xD;
      difference on the EQ5D. Preliminarily data will be derived for the primary endpoint target&#xD;
      lesion revascularization to enable future planning of larger comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to document procedural success following the use of IVL&#xD;
      in common femoral lesions, disease stage change, as well as disease-specific health status in&#xD;
      the real-world.&#xD;
