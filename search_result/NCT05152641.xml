  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability of BGE-117 and gain&#xD;
      information on the effectiveness of different doses when given to patients 65 years or older&#xD;
      with moderate to severe anemia following major hip surgery. BGE-117 is given once daily in a&#xD;
      capsule by mouth for up to 12 weeks. Patients are also given oral iron supplements. Anemia&#xD;
      following surgery has been associated with decreases in patient functioning. This study will&#xD;
      measure improvement of anemia, as well as various patient functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BGE-117 is being investigated to determine whether it is an effective treatment for moderate&#xD;
      to severe anemia in older individuals (65 years of age or older) after major hip surgery.&#xD;
      Currently, there are limited treatment options for postoperative anemia, in this patient&#xD;
      population, available in the USA, Australia, or New Zealand. The increased risk of morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, and poor quality of life in the population of older individuals with postoperative&#xD;
      anemia highlights the unmet medical need for a therapeutic agent that can alleviate physical&#xD;
      and functional deficits in these patients. Study BGE-117-203 will be the first clinical study&#xD;
      conducted in older patients with postoperative anemia. The study will collect important&#xD;
      safety, efficacy, and dosing information across this population of patients to provide key&#xD;
      data for designing further clinical studies in the development programs for BGE-117.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 2 populations of patients requiring hip surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  older individuals who are scheduled for elective unilateral or bilateral hip surgery&#xD;
           (total or partial hip replacement or revision of a previous replacement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  older individuals with an acute hip fracture requiring surgical repair or replacement&#xD;
           (usually performed within 48 hours after the fracture event)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These individuals must also meet the inclusion criterion for a hemoglobin level of ≤ 10 g/dL&#xD;
      and ≥ 7.0 g/dL from postoperative Day 1 to postoperative Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total planned enrollment for the study is approximately 192 subjects. The first 96&#xD;
      subjects who are enrolled will be randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BGE-117 8 mg PO once daily with oral iron supplement 3 times per week (n = 24)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BGE-117 4 mg PO once daily with oral iron supplement 3 times per week (n = 48)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matching placebo once daily with oral iron supplement 3 times per week (n = 24)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Review Meeting will be conducted when approximately 48 subjects have completed 4&#xD;
      weeks of treatment. Enrollment will remain ongoing for up to 96 subjects pending the Safety&#xD;
      Review Meeting. If no safety concerns are identified that would preclude the inclusion of&#xD;
      additional subjects, the subsequent 96 subjects who would be dosed up to 16 mg will be&#xD;
      allowed to proceed without interruption. Additional safety reviews will be completed after 96&#xD;
      subjects and 144 subjects have completed 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subsequent 96 subjects enrolled will be randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BGE-117 8 mg PO once daily with oral iron supplement 3 times per week (n = 24)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BGE-117 16 mg PO once daily with oral iron supplement 3 times per week (n = 48)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matching placebo once daily with oral iron supplement 3 times per week (n = 24)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study completion, the goal is to have approximately 48 subjects in each of the 4 treatment&#xD;
      groups (placebo, BGE-117 4 mg, BGE-117 8 mg, and BGE-117 16 mg) with each treatment group&#xD;
      having a similar number of subjects with acute hip fracture or elective hip surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Period is 12 weeks, and all enrolled subjects will be followed for a total of 6&#xD;
      months after surgery (14 weeks after cessation of IP) to monitor hemoglobin progression and&#xD;
      functional outcome as well as to continue to monitor for any potential AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no dose increases, however, dose decreases will be allowed if the rate of&#xD;
      increase in hemoglobin exceeds the protocol defined limits. The goal is to maintain an&#xD;
      approximate rate of hemoglobin increase of ≤ 1.5 g/dL every 2 weeks, and a maximum hemoglobin&#xD;
      level of 12.0 g/dL. Dosing will be considered completed and no additional IP will be&#xD;
      administered after the maximum hemoglobin value is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized within 24 hours of meeting the hemoglobin entry criteria. The&#xD;
      baseline hemoglobin value for the primary endpoint analysis will be the last (most recent)&#xD;
      hemoglobin level obtained via central laboratory before administration of the first dose of&#xD;
      blinded IP on Day 1. Treatment will start as soon as the subject has been randomized and is&#xD;
      able to take oral medications. Subjects enrolled in the study will continue once daily&#xD;
      treatment for a total of 12 weeks. Supplemental iron, provided by the Sponsor, will be&#xD;
      administered orally as ferrous sulfate 325 mg 3 times per week (e.g., every Monday,&#xD;
      Wednesday, and Friday).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be discharged from the hospital as soon as it is medically appropriate, but they&#xD;
      will continue to be seen at the study site at the following visits: Visit 2 (Day 1), Visit 4&#xD;
      (Day 15), Visit 8 (Day 43), and Visit 14 (Day 85). Home visits (including visits to&#xD;
      rehabilitation facilities, assisted living facilities, and nursing home facilities) will be&#xD;
      conducted at Visits 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 to assess vital signs and collect a&#xD;
      central blood sample for CBC and reticulocytes. There will be a home study visit&#xD;
      approximately 14 days after administration of the last dose of IP (Visit 15). Additional home&#xD;
      visits will be completed approximately 4 months after surgery on Day 127 (Visit 16), and&#xD;
      approximately 5 months after surgery on Day 155 (Visit 17). A final Follow up Visit at the&#xD;
      study site will be completed approximately 6 months after surgery on Day 183 (Visit 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled subjects must be able to personally give informed consent. Consent by guardian&#xD;
      or proxy will not be permitted. Screening will include a full physical examination and&#xD;
      baseline laboratory evaluation. Consent and screening procedures may be done preoperatively&#xD;
      or postoperatively based on type of surgery. If a subject consents and meets eligibility&#xD;
      criteria preoperatively, they must also meet eligibility criteria postoperatively to remain&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject does not consent preoperatively (e.g., hip fracture), they can consent&#xD;
      postoperatively. If enrolled, subjects will receive their first dose of IP at the study site.&#xD;
      They will be instructed to take IP orally once daily, approximately 1 hour before breakfast&#xD;
      for up to 83 additional days. Study medication will be administered in addition to oral iron&#xD;
      supplements and standard of care as deemed appropriate by the subject's treating physicians.&#xD;
      Oral iron in the form of ferrous sulfate 325 mg (supplied by the Sponsor) will be&#xD;
      administered 3 times per week after an overnight fast at the same time-of-day as IP. Subjects&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout the study for AEs and all relevant efficacy outcomes. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained periodically for safety laboratory tests, biomarkers of BGE 117&#xD;
      activity, inflammation, lipid, and iron status, and plasma pharmacokinetics (PK). Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed until 6 months after their surgery.&#xD;
