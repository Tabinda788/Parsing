  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ADM03820 to prevent symptomatic COVID-19&#xD;
      in adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled in the Phase 2 segment of the study and will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio with a total of 300 subjects receiving ADM03820 and 150 subjects&#xD;
      receiving placebo. In the Phase 3 segment, an additional 4,000 subjects will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio, for a total sample size (including the Phase 2 subjects) of 4,450&#xD;
      total subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Phase 2 segment is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      ADM03820 in adult subjects. The secondary objectives are to assess safety, PK,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and microneutralization (MN) of ADM03820 and to gather information&#xD;
      surrounding COVID-19 incidence rates and COVID-19 symptoms to support Phase 3 assumptions and&#xD;
      assessment of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the Phase 3 segment are to evaluate the efficacy of ADM03820 for&#xD;
      the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 in adult subjects. The secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of ADM03820 for prevention and amelioration of COVID-19 symptoms, to&#xD;
      monitor the incidence and severity of COVID-19, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of ADM03820.&#xD;
