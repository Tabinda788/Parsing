  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the virtual reality application in patients with bronchoscopy, it is aimed to reduce the&#xD;
      fear, stress and tension arising from the possibility of the development of pain and&#xD;
      complications in the patients. The research will be carried out in the form of&#xD;
      pretest-posttest application with 30 experimental and 30 control groups. The researcher aims&#xD;
      to minimize the fear and stress in the patient by applying the virtual reality application to&#xD;
      the patient in the experimental group 10 minutes before the procedure and 5-10 minutes during&#xD;
      the procedure. The researcher will download the licensed program called 'a walk on the beach'&#xD;
      to the virtual reality glasses and the patient will watch this program with glasses. The&#xD;
      patient in the experimental group will have to fill in the Visual Analogue Scale, Anxiety&#xD;
      Evaluation Form, Anxiety Symptoms Follow-up Form, and Patient Information Form before the&#xD;
      procedure. 10-15 minutes after the procedure, the patient will be asked to fill the Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale, Anxiety Evaluation Form, Anxiety Symptoms Follow-up Form and the Virtual&#xD;
      Reality Glasses Application Satisfaction Form. No procedure will be applied to the patients&#xD;
      in the control group and they will be asked to fill in the Patient Information Form, Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale Form, Anxiety Evaluation Scale Form, and Anxiety Symptoms Follow-up Form&#xD;
      before the procedure. After the procedure, he will be asked to fill in the other forms again,&#xD;
      except the Patient Information Form. Patients over the age of 18, who have no communication&#xD;
      problems, no psychiatric problems, who volunteered to participate in the study, and who had&#xD;
      local application in bronchoscopy will be included in the study. Patients with psychiatric&#xD;
      problems and communication problems will not be included in the study. Before the procedure,&#xD;
      the patient will be informed that his/her identity information will be kept confidential and&#xD;
      that he/she can withdraw from the research at any time, and all his/her rights will be&#xD;
      informed.&#xD;

      This study includes the examination of the effect of applying virtual reality interventions,&#xD;
      which are used for the treatment of anxiety problems, to patients who will undergo&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. For this purpose, first of all, a relaxation intervention will be designed in a&#xD;
      virtual reality environment. The virtual reality environment will be organized on the basis&#xD;
      of relaxation exercise. In this direction, first of all, an image will be created by taking&#xD;
      3D modeling service and the text of the relaxation exercise prepared in the presence of a&#xD;
      professional sound artist will be transferred to the image with sound. Afterwards, the&#xD;
      relaxation exercise created will be applied to the patients before and during the&#xD;
      bronchoscopy application. The aim of this study; It is aimed to examine the Effect of Virtual&#xD;
      Reality Based Relaxation Program on Pain Severity, Anxiety Level and Patient Satisfaction in&#xD;
      Patients to be Performed Bronchoscopy.&#xD;

    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to convert some values that cannot be measured numerically into digital. Two end definitions of the parameter to be evaluated are written at the two ends of a 100 mm line and the patient is asked to indicate where on this line their situation is appropriate by drawing a line or by placing a dot or pointing.</description>
