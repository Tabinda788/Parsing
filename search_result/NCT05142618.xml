  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the potential role of physical therapy in improving outcomes&#xD;
      after ventral hernia repair.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will perform assessments of several activities of daily living and complete&#xD;
      several surveys detailing their pre-surgical abilities, quality of life, and pain.&#xD;
      Immediately after their surgical procedure, patients will be randomized in a single-blind&#xD;
      manner (investigator) in a 1:1 ratio to supervised physical therapy (8 weeks, twice weekly)&#xD;
      or standard post-surgical precautions. Assessments and surveys will be repeated by the&#xD;
      blinded investigator at 30 days, 10 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
