    <textblock>
      The Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) Clinical Trials Unit has&#xD;
      developed the first cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) digital therapeutic (DTx) mobile&#xD;
      application to counteract depressive symptoms in military service members and veterans with a&#xD;
      history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This trial will assess the efficacy of the&#xD;
      novel CBT-DTx for depression following mTBI compared to an educational comparison DTx.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a single-blind, randomized, controlled interventional trial of current and&#xD;
      former military personnel with symptoms of depression and a history of mTBI. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted remotely.&#xD;
