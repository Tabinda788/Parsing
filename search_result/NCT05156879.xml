  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) is common in endometriosis and pain control is an&#xD;
      important goal of long-term management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral&#xD;
      contraception are the two first line therapies for endometriosis. High quality study about&#xD;
      aspirin for the EAPP is absent. In this study, we hypothesis that aspirin is effective in&#xD;
      controlling EAPP. A randomized, open, and controlled study will be implemented. Patients with&#xD;
      EAPP with visual Analogue Scale(VAS）&gt;30 mm will be included and low dose aspirin（75mg/day） be&#xD;
      prescribed. Yasmin(Drospirenone ethinyl estradiol tablet) will be used as positive control.&#xD;
      The primary efficacy end points is the reduction of the pain score of EAPP at 24th week&#xD;
      assessed with VAS score. Pelvic examination, sonography and blood test will be to performed&#xD;
      to evaluate the lesion and coagulation function. The adverse event and medication compliance&#xD;
      will be investigated. The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of low dose&#xD;
      aspirin therapy in management of EAPP. This study will provide new options for the long-term&#xD;
      management of endometriosis, which will help reduce the medical cost of endometriosis.&#xD;

      Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) is common in endometriosis and pain control is an&#xD;
      important goal of long-term management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral&#xD;
      contraception are the two first line therapies for endometriosis.However, there is currently&#xD;
      a lack of high-quality clinical studies of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic in&#xD;
      controlling EAPP. The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of low dose&#xD;
      aspirin therapy in management of EAPP. In this study, we hypothesis that aspirin is effective&#xD;
      in controlling EAPP. A randomized, open, and controlled study will be implemented. Subjects&#xD;
      were recruited in strict accordance the inclusion and exclusion criteria at the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. Patients with EAPP with visual Analogue Scale(VAS）&gt;30mm will be included. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects were randomized according to a computer-generated randomization schedule to to&#xD;
      receive aspirin（75mg/day）or Yasmin(Drospirenone ethinyl estradiol tablet) in a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
      Specific doctors will be designated for the disease diagnosis and ultrasonic examination.The&#xD;
      subjects were guided by EAPP pain score and drug use management. The primary efficacy end&#xD;
      points is the reduction of the pain score of EAPP at 24th week assessed with VAS score.&#xD;
      Pelvic examination, sonography and blood test will be to performed to evaluate the lesion and&#xD;
      coagulation function. The specification of the CONSORT case report system will be&#xD;
      implemented. Sample size assessment according equivalence study.Follow-up and loss cases were&#xD;
      strictly controlled. A two-sided test will performed with beta=0.80 and αlpha=0.025. The&#xD;
      expected loss rate is calculated at 15%. 220 cases will be enrolled with 110 cases in each&#xD;
      group. The study will be accepted regular monitoring and inspection.&#xD;
