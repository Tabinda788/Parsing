  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sternotomy site is the most painful area after cardiac surgery. Erector spinae plane&#xD;
      block is effective in thoracic and abdominal surgery, but literature is lacking in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. The bilateral erector spinae plane block could reduce pain at rest and during&#xD;
      mobilization, reduce opioids consumption, decrease postoperative complications, improve&#xD;
      respiratory outcomes and improve patient comfort and satisfaction. The research hypothesis is&#xD;
      that a single shot bilateral erector spinae plane block could reduce pain during mobilization&#xD;
      during the first 48 hours after cardiac surgery performed with sternotomy&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain after cardiac surgery is mostly localized at the sternotomy site. To improve&#xD;
      postoperative pain management a number of technics involving loco-regional anesthesia have&#xD;
      been developed. The epidural analgesia is the gold standard but the risk of epidural hematoma&#xD;
      with heparinization in this surgery avoids its utilization in clinical practice. The&#xD;
      paravertebral block can be used equally but there is a risk of pneumothorax. The erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block could be a solution as it is a more superficial block. It's efficacity was&#xD;
      proven in thoracic and abdominal surgery, but literature is lacking in cardiac surgery. A&#xD;
      bilateral erector spinae plane block after cardiac surgery could significantly reduce pain at&#xD;
      rest and during mobilization, reduce opioids consumption, decrease postoperative&#xD;
      complications, improve respiratory outcomes and improve patient comfort and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this to study is to examine the efficacity of a single-shot bilateral&#xD;
      erector spinae plane block on pain reduction during mobilization during the first 48 hours&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scale at patient mobilization during the first postoperative 48 hours measured by&#xD;
      numerical pain scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, doubled-blinded, single-center controlled trial with two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ropivacaine group (42 patients): a bilateral erector spinae block will be performed&#xD;
           after patient arrival in the intensive care unit before wake up from anesthesia with&#xD;
           20ml of Ropivacaine 2mg/ml bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group (42 patients): a sham block will be performed bilaterally in the same&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
