      Introduction: The death of a partner is a frequent and very stressful critical life event in&#xD;
      later life. Grief and psychological distress after the loss of a partner are normative&#xD;
      reactions. However, 10% of individuals are less able to cope with bereavement and show&#xD;
      symptoms of disturbed or prolonged grief, or adaptation problems. Focus groups have concluded&#xD;
      that Portuguese older adults who lost their partner avoid and downplay the grief process, not&#xD;
      seeking help when needed. LEAVES is an interactive self-help online programme founded in the&#xD;
      task model of mourning and the dual-process model of coping with bereavement that supports&#xD;
      older adults who have lost their partner in dealing with and preventing prolonged grief. As&#xD;
      part of an international consortium with two more trial centres, LEAVES-PT will carry out a&#xD;
      10-week pragmatic randomised two-armed parallel-group controlled trial to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of LEAVES vs. usual care in reducing grief in community-dwelling Portuguese&#xD;
      adults over 55 years who have lost a partner. Besides the clinical evaluation, a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Adults over 55 years, who have lost a partner and are registered with a primary care&#xD;
      service in Lower Alentejo, Portugal will be invited to participate and, after screening for&#xD;
      eligibility, a minimum of 100 will be randomised to one of two arms: usual care + LEAVES&#xD;
      online service or usual care (1:1). The intervention will last for 10 weeks and follow-up&#xD;
      will last for a further 10 weeks (20 weeks). Grief is the primary endpoint and it is measured&#xD;
      by the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief. Linear mixed models will be used to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of LEAVES on grief symptoms using the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The death of a partner is a frequent and very stressful critical life event in later life. It&#xD;
      implies a dissolution of social and emotional ties. This deeply affects the attachment&#xD;
      system, requires the acceptance of the loss, as well as the formation of a new identity and a&#xD;
      new perspective for the future. It involves the adaptation of daily routines which can be&#xD;
      even more challenging when social, physical, and financial resources decline in later life.&#xD;
      Grief and psychological distress after the loss of a partner are normative reactions. For&#xD;
      most people, grief intensity weakens to a manageable degree within several weeks or months.&#xD;
      After the most intensive period, grief is still present, but the loss becomes gradually&#xD;
      integrated and no longer hinders the way of ongoing life. However, some individuals are less&#xD;
      able to cope with bereavement and show symptoms of disturbed or prolonged grief, or&#xD;
      adaptation problems. About 10% of older adults develop a prolonged grief disorder or&#xD;
      persistent complex bereavement disorder, characterised by separation distress, frequent or&#xD;
      disabling cognitive, emotional and behavioural symptoms, such as avoidance of reminders of&#xD;
      the loved one, difficulties moving on with life and functional impairment. The development of&#xD;
      prolonged grief or adaptation problems often goes unnoticed by the widow(er) who then fail to&#xD;
      realize that help may be needed. This leads to a situation in which older adults are unaware&#xD;
      of their own needs, do not seek help, and do not receive the care needed. Previous focus&#xD;
      groups and stakeholder's feedback have noted that Portuguese older adults who lost their&#xD;
      partner (and their family members) avoid and downplay the grief process, not seeking help&#xD;
      when needed. This may lead to a high usage of primary care and, later on, to mental health&#xD;
      services, with complaints of insomnia, physical and depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide range of interventions are available for either preventing or treating prolonged grief&#xD;
      disorder including support groups, writing exercises, and individual psychological&#xD;
      counselling, and, more recently, internet-based options. Such interventions mostly consist of&#xD;
      writing exercises with minimal therapist involvement. Previously, Brodbeck and colleagues&#xD;
      found that a 12-week intervention with a bereavement online support service (LIVIA) in Swiss&#xD;
      adults 40+ years old had a medium to large effect on grief, depression and loneliness over 3&#xD;
      months as well as increasing life satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adapted from LIVIA and combining features from the &quot;Before you leave&quot; app, LEAVES is an&#xD;
      online self-help interactive programme founded in the task model of mourning and the&#xD;
      dual-process model of coping with bereavement that supports older adults who have lost their&#xD;
      partner in dealing with and preventing prolonged grief following a user-centred, iterative&#xD;
      and agile approach. In LEAVES-PT the investigators will carry out a 10-week pragmatic&#xD;
      randomised two-armed parallel-group controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of LEAVES&#xD;
      vs. usual care in reducing grief in community-dwelling Portuguese adults over 55 years&#xD;
      registered with the local primary care unit. Besides the clinical evaluation, a qualitative&#xD;
      study of implementation and engagement with the LEAVES online service and a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out. This trial (LEAVES-PT) is part of a larger&#xD;
      study from an international consortium (LEAVES) with two more trial centres but with distinct&#xD;
      design and methodology (The Netherlands and Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context on Lower Alentejo's Population and ULSBA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEAVES-PT is coordinated by the Local Health Unit of Lower Alentejo's (ULSBA) Psychiatry&#xD;
      Department. ULSBA comprises several primary care services across the region, a public health&#xD;
      unit, a Hospital as well as a palliative care community support team. ULSBA is located in the&#xD;
      largest district of Portugal (district of Beja), covering 10.4% of Portugal's total area,&#xD;
      while serving the second least populated regional district area of Portugal with a population&#xD;
      density 9 times lower than the national average. Lower Alentejo (and the district of Beja) is&#xD;
      a predominantly rural and relatively poor area, with a high percentage of older adults,&#xD;
      declining population, underdeveloped public transportation system and, up until recently,&#xD;
      underserved in terms of mental healthcare assistance. ULSBA has a long-standing history of&#xD;
      community health prevention and promotion. Specifically, ULSBA has implemented a&#xD;
      community-based mental health promotion program for older adults in social isolation that&#xD;
      included strategies on how to cope with grief. Leveraging on this expertise and in the&#xD;
      context of LEAVES-PT, ULSBA will contact community-dwelling older adults registered in&#xD;
      primary care services in Lower Alentejo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a dialogue-based online self-help programme (LEAVES) intervention significantly&#xD;
           decreases grief depression symptoms and perceived loneliness (small to medium effect)&#xD;
           compared to the usual care control arm over 20 weeks in a clinical sample of Portuguese&#xD;
           adults over 55;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. participants where the loss occurred more recently (especially &lt; 6 months) and/or have&#xD;
           more severe grief symptoms at baseline will benefit more from the LEAVES intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses, the investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determine the effectiveness of a 10-week intervention with LEAVES vs usual care control&#xD;
           over 20 weeks in a pragmatic randomised two-armed parallel-group controlled trial on: 1)&#xD;
           Grief symptoms (primary endpoint) and, 2) Depression symptoms and Loneliness (secondary&#xD;
           endpoints);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determine if time since loss and severity of grief symptoms at baseline are moderators&#xD;
           for the effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit and randomise 100 participants where 50 participants will be&#xD;
      allocated to each arm. The intervention will last 10 weeks, and participants will be followed&#xD;
      for a further 10 weeks (20 weeks since baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, Brodbeck and colleagues found that an intervention with LIVIA (a bereavement&#xD;
      online support service) in Swiss adults 40+ years old had a large effect on grief (d = 0.81)&#xD;
      compared to the control arm. In Alentejo, Portugal and in adults 55 years and over the&#xD;
      investigators expect the LEAVES intervention to have a small to medium effect on grief (d &gt;&#xD;
      0.30) (as measured by TRIG) vs usual care (control arm). To find a significant difference&#xD;
      between intervention and control at 80% power and with an α of 0.05, assuming a correlation&#xD;
      of 0.65 among repeated measurements and using ANOVA, a total of 52 participants are&#xD;
      necessary. The investigators anticipate a dropout of 20% between recruitment and the start of&#xD;
      the trial (10 weeks) and a 30% dropout over the study duration (20 weeks). In view of the&#xD;
      sample size calculation, the investigators aim to recruit at least 100 participants with 50&#xD;
      participants per arm. Power calculations were done with G*Power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be coordinated by ULSBA located in Beja, Portugal by 4-6 clinical&#xD;
      psychologists and/or mental health nurses. Participants registered with ULSBA's primary care&#xD;
      services, who are 55 years and over and widowed will be randomly contacted by clinical staff&#xD;
      through telephone following a six-step model for optimal recruitment: (1) explain the&#xD;
      condition, (2) reassure patients about receiving treatment, (3) establish uncertainty, (4)&#xD;
      explain the study purpose, (5) give a balanced view of treatments, and (6) Explain study&#xD;
      procedure. The first 100 participants to accept to participate in LEAVES-PT will be screened&#xD;
      according to the eligibility criteria and if included, assigned a treatment. If the&#xD;
      investigators do not manage to recruit 100 participants, the recruitment will be extended to&#xD;
      other districts in Portugal besides Beja. Participants will also be asked for the preferred&#xD;
      place of assessment, if in-person and at the hospital/ primary care centre or in-person and&#xD;
      at their usual place of residence. To minimize dropout and increase adherence, participants&#xD;
      will be contacted regularly to address troubleshooting or other technological issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the initial telephone risk assessment data on most variables will be collected&#xD;
      through face-to-face interviews at the participant's usual residency or at ULSBA, however is&#xD;
      more convenient for the participant. Data on module completion, duration and intensity of the&#xD;
      LEAVES support service will be collected automatically within the online platform. In&#xD;
      accordance with the data minimisation principle, the investigators certify that only&#xD;
      variables indispensable for the trial will be collected. All data will be stored and analysed&#xD;
      in an anonymous and unidentifiable format in such a way that the database entries cannot be&#xD;
      linked to the personal identity of the study participants. Servers are protected by high-end&#xD;
      firewall systems and only researchers directly involved in the study have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data cleaning and quality control will be performed prior to analysis. Normality will be&#xD;
      assessed by Q-Q plots: normally distributed variables will be presented as means and SDs,&#xD;
      non-Gaussian distributed variables as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and categorical&#xD;
      data as percentages (with corresponding frequency). Missing value analysis will be carried&#xD;
      out to explore the patterns, the extent and the type of missing data. Assuming that data will&#xD;
      be missing at random, linear mixed models will be used to determine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention vs the control on grief symptoms over the 20 weeks of follow-up and using the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle. Models for the primary and secondary outcomes will have terms&#xD;
      for time (pre vs post intervention measures and post intervention vs follow-up measures),&#xD;
      group (usual care vs. LEAVES + usual care), possible non-randomised confounders and&#xD;
      interaction terms. As a sensitivity analysis, LEAVES-PT will explore moderators such as sex,&#xD;
      age, time since loss and severity of grief symptoms. Cohen's d will be calculated for all&#xD;
      models. Point estimates and confidence intervals will be used to assess statistical and&#xD;
      clinical significance. Results of the linear mixed models will be presented as βs and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the&#xD;
      intervention, in terms of cost per point-improvement in the grief scale. The investigators&#xD;
      will also look at depression and loneliness (secondary outcomes) and estimate ICERs using&#xD;
      improvements in the depression or loneliness scales in the denominator according to the&#xD;
      following: ICER = cost of delivering the intervention/ total improvement in grief symptoms.&#xD;
      The investigators will adopt a provider perspective, taking into account, in the numerator,&#xD;
      the costs borne by the provider of the intervention. The investigators will consider both&#xD;
      technological (equipment costs, cost of using the platform) and human costs (training, time&#xD;
      spent by staff delivering the intervention) associated with providing the intervention.&#xD;
