  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib compared with placebo in adult participants&#xD;
      aged 18 to 85 years old with moderate-to-severe gMG, who are receiving Standard of Care&#xD;
      (SoC). The double-blind (DB) treatment period of 26 weeks will comprise of 7 site visits&#xD;
      followed by a 2-year open label extension (OLE) period with quarterly visits. The efficacy of&#xD;
      tolebrutinib versus placebo during DB period will be assessed by clinical evaluations, that&#xD;
      include scales based on physician examination or direct participant feedback i.e., patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes (PROs). These evaluations will continue during the OLE in order to measure&#xD;
      long term efficacy and safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The duration of the DB period will be 26 weeks. The OLE is up to 104 weeks. The duration of&#xD;

    <description>The MG-ADL is a categorical scale that assesses the impact on daily function of 8 signs symptoms that are typically affected in MG. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function (total score 0 to 24).</description>

    <description>The Myasthenia Gravis Impairment Index (MGII) is a measure of MG impairment focused on the severity of MG impairment and the concept of fatigability. Consists of a 22-item patient-reported questionnaire with 6 clinician assessment items. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity.</description>

    <description>The MG-QoL15 is a 15-item measure of people with MG QoL instrument that will be self-reported by the participant. The domains covered by the questionnaire are mobility (9 items), symptoms (3 items), general contentment (1 item) and emotional well-being (2 items). Responses to each question are scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) where higher scores representing worse QoL.</description>
