    <textblock>
      Multidisciplinary team-approach in order to offer personalized treatments represents the&#xD;
      emerging mainstream in cardiovascular medicine. &quot;Hybrid operative rooms&quot; allow to offer&#xD;
      selected heart-disease patients truly &quot;tailored&quot; operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study wants to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Hybrid Procedures in cardiac&#xD;
      patients in three subgroups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hybrid coronary revascularization strategy (coronary by-pass + PCI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hybrid valve and coronary disease correction (combination of surgical valve replacement&#xD;
           and PCI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hybrid coronary and carotid artery disease treatment (combination of coronary by-pass&#xD;
           and carotid stenting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that morbidity might be reduced by 50% in hybrid procedures&#xD;
      group as compared with predicted Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular medicine is actually evolving fast and multidisciplinary team-approach in&#xD;
      order to offer personalized treatments represents the emerging mainstream. The possibility to&#xD;
      realize combinations of treatments traditionally available only in the catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory and in the operating room represent the rationale for &quot;hybrid operative rooms&quot;&#xD;
      facilities allowing to offer selected heart-disease patients truly &quot;tailored&quot; operations.&#xD;
      Such &quot;Hybrid&quot; management strategies usually combine transcatheter techniques and surgery&#xD;
      (often minimally invasive) in order to combine the reduced invasiveness of the former with&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the latter. Common examples of surgical and transcatheter combinations&#xD;
      are: hybrid revascularization performed with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); combined heart valve and coronary disease treated&#xD;
      with valve surgery and PCI; combined endo- and epicardial ablation of atrial fibrillation;&#xD;
      thoracic aneurysms treated with endovascular stenting and surgical debranching of the arch;&#xD;
      carotid artery stenting along with CABG. Given the relatively recent development of these&#xD;
      techniques, indications and patient selection are yet to be defined and a productive&#xD;
      collaboration between surgeons and interventional cardiologists is of paramount importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Hybrid Procedures in cardiac&#xD;
      patients. Specifically, three subgroups will be analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hybrid coronary revascularization strategy (HCR, coronary by-pass + PCI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hybrid valve and coronary disease correction (combination of surgical valve replacement&#xD;
           and PCI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hybrid coronary and carotid artery disease treatment (combination of coronary by-pass&#xD;
           and carotid stenting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local Heart Team (cardiac surgeon, interventional cardiologist, clinical cardiologist and&#xD;
      anaesthetist) will decide which patients will be referred for hybrid treatment. Typically,&#xD;
      this happens when the Heart Team feels that hybrid treatment could reduce the overall risk of&#xD;
      a combined procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population consists of adult patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) involving the left main and/or the left&#xD;
           anterior descending artery with indication for revascularization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe, symptomatic valvular disease and CAD with indication for revascularization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant unilateral carotid stenosis and CAD with indication for revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous data review board on the Heart Team activity, we recognized that 10% of&#xD;
      discussed patients are referred for hybrid procedures (HP) and that observed operative&#xD;
      mortality was strongly lower than that predicted by STS and EuroSCORE (2.5% versus 10.1% and&#xD;
      5.9%, respectively). Morbidity was not prospectively investigated. For sample size&#xD;
      estimation, the investigators hypothesized that Morbidity might be reduced by 50% in HP group&#xD;
      as compared with predicted STS. The mean expected STS morbidity estimated in the study&#xD;
      population is 32.57%. Accordingly, a total number of 111 patients with an alpha error of 5%&#xD;
      and a beta error of 20% has been calculated to be needed to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
