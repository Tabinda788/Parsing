      Aims: To investigate early markers of arterial stiffness and nerve dysfunction and the&#xD;
      association to an extended glucose metabolic profile comprising glucose control (current and&#xD;
      past), glucose variability and insulin sensitivity in children and adolescents with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (T1D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Most Danish children and adolescents with T1D do not achieve their metabolic&#xD;
      target and are at increased risk of developing long-term diabetic complications, reducing&#xD;
      their life expectancy and increase their morbidity rate. Hence, improved metabolic control, a&#xD;
      better understanding of what optimal metabolic control means, combined with detailed&#xD;
      monitoring of the first markers of long-term complications and their reversibility or lack&#xD;
      thereof are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cross-sectional study of 400 children, aged 6-18 years old, with T1D&gt;12 months.&#xD;
      Early markers of long-term diabetic complications will be investigated as arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      nerve dysfunction and nephropathy. Data on T1D onset, duration, treatment modality,&#xD;
      self-monitoring-blood-glucose profiles, growth, weight, and pubertal status will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling will include routine tests and markers of glucose, lipid, bone, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal metabolism. DXA-scan, Fibroscan, bone-age and physical activity will be&#xD;
      measured. Data on retrospective glucose- and lipid-profiles will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: This study provides novel insight into the frequency of early markers of&#xD;
      long-term diabetic complications and its association to the interplay of the pancreas,&#xD;
      adipose, gastrointestinal and bone metabolic axis. Which can assist in identifying subgroups&#xD;
      of children and adolescents requiring earlier in-depth screening for early markers of&#xD;
      long-term diabetic complications, for putative interventions for prevention, hence reducing&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in T1D.&#xD;

      The project is designed as a cross-sectional cohort study. The study consists of a one-day&#xD;
      visit where 400 children and adolescents with T1D will be thoroughly examined after an&#xD;
      overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following examinations are parof this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Standard physical examination: Including cor/pulm/abdomen, heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement. Data regarding age, sex, diabetes duration, growth, weight, and pubertal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bloodsampling: Include routine tests (hemoglobin and iron metabolites, BS, HbA1c,&#xD;
           electrolytes, creatinine, urea, LDL, HDL, triglyceride, total cholesterol), and markers&#xD;
           of glucose (insulin, c-peptide), lipid (leptin, adiponectin), bone (VitD, calcium, PTH,&#xD;
           phosphate, magnesium, BASP, OCN, P1NP, CTX, uOCN, sclerostine, RANKL, osteoprotegrin and&#xD;
           osteoglycin), gastrointestinal (GLP-1, GIP and glucagon) metabolism. IGF-1, IGF-BP3,&#xD;
           thyroid metabolism (TSH, T3, free T4), sex hormones, adrenal androgens, aldosterone.&#xD;
           Thyroid and celiac disease autoantibodies. Markers for inflammation and endothelial&#xD;
           dysfunction will be examined. Plasma, serum and urine will also be collected for a&#xD;
           Biobank for future research e.g. for studying metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity: Assessed with the Sphygmocor (AtCor Medical) device&#xD;
           to measure arterial stiffness in the large arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the nervous system function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac autonomic neuropathy function will be assessed by the Vagus device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Large sensory nerve function test assessed by sural nerve conduction velocity and sural&#xD;
           nerve amplitude, measured with the non-invasive handheld device DPNCheckTM (NeuroMetrix,&#xD;
           Inc., Waltham, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small sympathetic nerve fiber function assessed by electrochemical skin conductance&#xD;
           assessed using the non- invasive device Sudoscanâ„¢ (Impeto Medical, Paris, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney: Three morning urine samples will be collected at home for analyses of&#xD;
           albumin/creatinine ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone age Measured on an x-ray of the left hand using BoneXpert software to adjust for&#xD;
           potentially biological age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan: Performed to evaluate body composition and bone&#xD;
           mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibroscan: To determine the stiffness of the liver (liver elastography).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) Evaluation of glucose variability for at least&#xD;
           14 days. Most children and adolescent at our outpatient clinics use these as part of&#xD;
           their regular regulation and treatment. If the participant normally uses a CGM-device,&#xD;
           data on blood glucose variation from the past 90 days will be collected. If not a&#xD;
           CGM-monitor will be placed on the upper arm and the participants will be instructed to&#xD;
           wear it for the next 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Actigraph Physical activity for 7 days will be measured. Questionnaire Physical&#xD;
           activity, Life quality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history/journals Diabetes duration, treatment modality, insulin dosage, previous&#xD;
      medication, episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All earlier blood samples on: Hba1c, HDL, LDL, cholesterol. All earlier blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, weight, height, abdominal and hip circumference. Diabetic complication status:&#xD;
      nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy or vascular complications. Data on current and prior&#xD;
      asthma, atopy and eczema will be collected. Family history of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, asthma and atopy will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin sensitivity Calculated using a validated score based upon Hba1c, waist circumference,&#xD;
      fasting glucose and fasting insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Paediatric Diabetes outpatient clinic at Steno&#xD;
      Diabetes Center Copenhagen (SDCC). All examinations and tests will be performed at Herlev&#xD;
      Paediatric Department and at SDCC. All children aged 6-18 years, with T1D for more than 12&#xD;
      months will be offered to participate. With a total of 950 T1D children/adolescent followed&#xD;
      yearly at SDCC the planned number of participants is realistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The methods applied to measure early markers of long-term diabetic complications&#xD;
      both regarding arterial stiffness and the nerve system are all continuous parameters and no&#xD;
      definitive cut offs between normal and early changes in children and adolescent are known.&#xD;
      Therefore, sample size calculation for this study is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described earlier, the SEARCH-study (7, 22) included some of the same outcome for&#xD;
      evaluating cardiovascular-, nephrotic- and nerve system complications and showed&#xD;
      statistically significant results with a number of 289 adolescents with T1D. We plan to&#xD;
      include 400 children and adolescent with T1D in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For descriptive data we will report frequency, mean (standard deviation) or median&#xD;
      (interquartile range), as appropriate. Comparisons between relevant groups will be done for&#xD;
      means with t-tests and medians with Mann-Whitney U-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear regression models will be applied to assess the cross-sectional associations.&#xD;
      Univariate and multivariable models will be used; adjustment will include risk factors and&#xD;
      confounders based on prior evidence. In all analyses, model assumptions will be ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
