      individual. In this study, the effect of logotherapy counseling program on dignity, chronic&#xD;

    <description>Logotherapy is a method of finding meaning with three basic principles. The first principle is that life is meaningful in every situation , even in the most desperate moments. The second principle is that the main source of motivation is the desire to find meaning in life. The third is that an individual is free to choose his own attitude even in the worst conditions.</description>
