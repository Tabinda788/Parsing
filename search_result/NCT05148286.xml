      The current guideline emphasizes fluid resuscitation as the mainstay of initial management&#xD;
      for septic shock. Albumin has the oncotic activity to maintain intravascular volumes with&#xD;
      additional beneficial properties in sepsis. Prior studies showed that the replacement of&#xD;
      albumin might have survival advantages in patients with septic shock. We aim to assess&#xD;
      whether the early administration of albumin with crystalloid as initial fluid resuscitation&#xD;
      improves survival in patients with septic shock compared to resuscitation without albumin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, contributing to an estimated 11 million&#xD;
      deaths in 2017-or 20% of all global deaths. Due to recent advances in the medical management&#xD;
      and treatment of sepsis, the mortality of sepsis has been declined in these years, but still&#xD;
      stayed at a high level. From 2004, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) suggested a&#xD;
      protocolized bundle therapy to facilitate implementation at the bedside with a defined&#xD;
      target. Recent guideline states that this resuscitation bundle treatment should be initiated&#xD;
      within 1 h of the emergency department (ED) triage time, named as 1-h bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid resuscitation, which is the mainstay of treatment to restore a patient's tissue&#xD;
      perfusion, is associated with outcome in emergency department patients. The current guideline&#xD;
      recommends that crystalloid for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis and albumin can be&#xD;
      additionally administered when patients require substantial amounts of crystalloid. Besides&#xD;
      its oncotic functions to provide adequate intravascular volume, albumin has several&#xD;
      beneficial properties for sepsis patients, including binding and transport of various&#xD;
      endogenous molecules, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, and modulation of nitric&#xD;
      oxide metabolism. In 2004, a large randomized, prospective, double-blind study was performed&#xD;
      in 7000 critically ill patients (SAFE study) to evaluate the effect of volume replacement&#xD;
      therapy with human albumin on the outcome compared to only crystalloid. Although the survival&#xD;
      rates were similar between the groups, a post hoc analysis of 1218 patients with severe&#xD;
      sepsis showed improved survival in the albumin group compared to crystalloid alone.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the ALBumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) study investigated the effect of&#xD;
      albumin administration and maintenance of serum albumin concentrations to at least 30 g/l on&#xD;
      outcome in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. This study showed a similar result&#xD;
      to SAFE study that no difference on the outcome between the groups. Nevertheless, in the 1121&#xD;
      patients with septic shock, 90-day mortality was lower in the albumin group (564 patients)&#xD;
      than in the non-albumin group (43.6 vs. 49%, p = 0.03). Recently, a retrospective study which&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of administration of albumin combined with crystalloids in septic&#xD;
      patients showed improved survival in 28 days. Therefore, accumulating evidence suggests that&#xD;
      early albumin administration may provide a survival benefit in patients with severe and&#xD;
      advanced sepsis. However, no prospective, randomized trial has adequately studied this&#xD;
      hypothesis in patients with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the ALCAMIST (ALbumin and Crystalloid AdMinistration In SepTic shock) study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of albumin and crystalloid administration as an initial fluid choice&#xD;
      in septic shock compared to crystalloid alone on patient survival.&#xD;
