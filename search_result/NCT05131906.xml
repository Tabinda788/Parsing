    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the visual cues of a wearable&#xD;
      device in preventing freezing of gait (FOG) in those with PD.The aim is to investigate the&#xD;
      impact of laser shoe attachments on gait in single and dual-tasking scenarios, as well as&#xD;
      &quot;real-world&quot; mobility scenarios, in people with PD who freeze. For this study, participants&#xD;
      will wear sensors on their feet, hips, chest, and head to show stride length, foot angle, and&#xD;
      foot height, and head position during different gait assessments. The patients will do the&#xD;
      gait assessments without the laser shoes and with the laser shoes to determine how the laser&#xD;
      shoes affect freezing of gait. The gait assessments include having the patient complete a two&#xD;
      minute walk, two minute walk with another task (reciting every other letter of the alphabet),&#xD;
      obstacle course, obstacle course with another task (reciting every other letter of the&#xD;
      alphabet), and quickly turning in place. The assessments are activities that are performed in&#xD;
      everyday activities so there are no risks associated with these requested tasks. These&#xD;
      activities will be done in a lab at the Phoenix Biomedical Campus. Safety for the&#xD;
      participants will be monitored by placing a belt around the waist of the participant with a&#xD;
      member of the research personnel close by in case the participant demonstrated a shift in&#xD;
      their balance. The research member can use the belt to provide stability and secure the&#xD;
      participant, preventing them from further loss of balance. Moreover, three different&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADL's) will be assessed with and without the laser shoes in a&#xD;
      simulated apartment environment located at the Phoenix Biomedical campus. The ADL's include&#xD;
      walking from the bed to the kitchen, walking from the living room to the kitchen and making&#xD;
      tea in the microwave, and answering the door. The activities to be done in the apartment&#xD;
      setting will be video-recorded and analyzed. Some participants will be given the laser shoes&#xD;
      to take home and use for one week. The same protocol explained above will be used to assess&#xD;
      freezing of gait after this one week in those selected participants. To assess retention of&#xD;
      improvements, the participants who took the laser shoes home will also be given the same&#xD;
      protocol two days later (after not having used the laser shoes during that time).&#xD;
      Participants will also complete surveys for quality of life, freezing and gait and cognitive&#xD;
      function. A standard test for balance will also be conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15 individuals with Parkinson's Disease will complete two tasks: a gait task and an activity&#xD;
      of daily living (ADL) task both with and without the use of laser shoe attachment. The gait&#xD;
      task involves 5 separate scenarios: 2 min walk with a single and dual-task trial, obstacle&#xD;
      course with a single and dual-task trial, and a quick turn-in-place. For the dual-task&#xD;
      trials, participants will complete the 2 min walk and obstacle course scenarios in addition&#xD;
      to a cognitive task (e.g. reciting the alphabet every other letter). During the single-task&#xD;
      trials for the 2 min walk and obstacle course, participants will complete these activities&#xD;
      without a cognitive task. Participants will also be required to fill out surveys for quality&#xD;
      of life, balance and freezing of gait. A standard test for balance will be conducted&#xD;
      (MiniBEST). Participants will be assessed using the UPDRS in order to categorize the level of&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease. Permission and training for use of the UPDRS will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      testing participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADL task involves three &quot;real-world&quot; mobility scenarios, in which participants will be&#xD;
      asked to: walk from the bedroom to the bathroom and also the kitchen, make tea in the&#xD;
      kitchen, and move from the couch to answer the front door.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both tasks, gait will be characterized during each scenario using inertial sensors&#xD;
      (OPALs). Outcomes will include step length, foot angle and foot height (clearance from floor)&#xD;
      and head movement. To characterize functional movements we will video movements during all&#xD;
      scenarios for both tasks. Outcomes will be the number and temporal length of each freezing&#xD;
      event, to be determined by a movement disorders neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of participants (n=3) will use the sensors at home for 1 week, and return to the lab&#xD;
      for gait and functional task assessment. They will return after a 2-day washout (no sensors)&#xD;
      to assess retention of improvements from the 1-week exposure.&#xD;

    <description>Freezing of gait (FoG) ratio is calculated from acceleration of the shins (measured via inertial sensors, Opals by APDM) in-place turning. First, power spectral density from antero-posterior acceleration signals are calculated. Then, a FoG ratio is calculated as the ratio of total power in the &quot;freezing band&quot; (3-8 Hz) and the &quot;locomotion band&quot; (0.5-3 Hz). Higher freezing ratios indicate higher severity of FoG. (Tang et al., 2019).</description>
