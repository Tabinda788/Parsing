  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 20% of strokes are caused by emboli deriving from a carotid plaque. In symptomatic&#xD;
      patients with carotid stenosis grater than 70% the Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) reduces&#xD;
      stroke risk by about 75% and is generally accepted as being cost effective. However also in&#xD;
      these cases there is a part of the population that, according to the morphological plaque&#xD;
      characteristics, could better benefit from a conservative medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the Best Medical Treatment, the situation seems to be even less clear in&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients, where probably it would need to treat at least 32 patients in order to&#xD;
      prevent one single ictus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different parameters have been considered in order to determine, among the asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients the ones that more than others could benefit from a surgical revascularisation&#xD;
      instead of a medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between these parameters, the quality of the plaque (vulnerability) and the micro-embolic&#xD;
      signals (MES) detection with the Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Holter seems to be the most&#xD;
      relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another interesting aspect is trying to establish whether plaques can determine a different&#xD;
      embolic risk in relation to the different histological findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it seems interesting and reasonable trying to establish a correlation between&#xD;
      these two parameters in asymptomatic patients as in the symptomatic ones in order to make&#xD;
      more and more appropriate a surgical plaque removal according to the specific risk of each&#xD;
      patient in a set of tailored surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It consists in a descriptive observational study, since it intends to describe the embolic&#xD;
      signals detection (MES) counted in automatic way with the TCD Holter, in patients affected by&#xD;
      carotid stenosis, before and after the surgical operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular it consists in a monocentric, longitudinal, prospective cohort study since it&#xD;
      intends to analyse a group of patients (already candidates to CEA) that experiences a&#xD;
      specific event (MES) before and after the surgical plaque removal, in a precise span of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the treatment, removing the plaque, should remove the embolic focus too, a significant&#xD;
      reduction of microembolic signals in post-operative time is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This reduction has been esteemed around about the 70% among candidates to CEA. Patients taken&#xD;
      on responsibility of the equipe will undergo an ultrasonographic investigation for the&#xD;
      carotid stenosis, histological characterization of the plaque based on the Gray-Weale&#xD;
      classification and TCD-Holter for MES.&#xD;
