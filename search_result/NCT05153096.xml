    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion Phase I&#xD;
      clinical study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of NBL-015 in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label phase I clinical trial conducted in patients with&#xD;
      CLDN18.2-positive advanced solid tumors, aiming to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of NBL-015 in patient with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two stages: the stage I (dose escalation and dose expansion) and the&#xD;
      stage II (NBL-015 monotherapy cohort expansion and combination of NBL-015 with standard&#xD;
      treatment cohort expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation phase is divided into 5 dose levels. NBL-015 is escalated in order of 1&#xD;
      mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg until MTD. If MTD is still not observed in the&#xD;
      preset highest dose group, the investigator and the sponsor can jointly decide whether to&#xD;
      conduct a higher dose group study. If necessary, intermediate doses may be conducted. The&#xD;
      first dose group (1 mg/kg) is the accelerated titration group, in which 1 patient will be&#xD;
      enrolled, and the &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design will be followed from the second dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If RP2D can be determined based on clinical study data in the dose escalation stage, Stage II&#xD;
      cohort expansion will be directly conducted. Alternatively, based on the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy data obtained from dose-escalation studies, dose expansion and different dosing&#xD;
      can be explored if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on available PK and clinical efficacy data, appropriate dose groups will be selected&#xD;
      for cohort expansion. The cohort expansion stage includes the NBL-015 monotherapy cohort&#xD;
      expansion trial and the combination of NBL-015with standard treatment cohort expansion trial.&#xD;
