  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is one of the most debilitating side effects of radiation therapy and various&#xD;
      forms of chemotherapy, especially for head and neck cancers and hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a consequence of the cytostatic effects of anticancer treatments on rapidly renewing&#xD;
      cells of the oral mucosa; An ulcer appears which will increase in size due to subsequent&#xD;
      bacterial, fungal and / or viral growth, while the leakage of toxins through damaged&#xD;
      capillaries causes irritation and a burning sensation. Proteolytic enzymes, known to destroy&#xD;
      the extracellular matrix, inhibit cell regeneration and healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the severity of the ulceration, infection and feeding possibilities, mucositis&#xD;
      is scored between grade 0 (absent) and grade 4 (maximum) (according to the WHO (World Health&#xD;
      Organization) classification or the NCI-CTCAE (National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events), the latter degree most often requiring a modification of the&#xD;
      anticancer treatment which may have an impact on the prognosis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, theoretically, mucositis is easy to treat because it only requires simple cleaning&#xD;
      of the ulcers and stimulation of the growth of the underlying healthy cells to make up for&#xD;
      the loss of substance, there are currently only limited symptomatic treatments available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is one of the frequent and disabling effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy,&#xD;
      with an impact on the quality of life of patients and induced or prolonged hospital stays. It&#xD;
      is a consequence of the cytostatic effects of anticancer treatments on rapidly renewing cells&#xD;
      of the oral mucosa. Proteolytic enzymes, known to destroy the extracellular matrix, inhibit&#xD;
      cell regeneration and healing. Treatment is currently symptomatic, with little effectiveness.&#xD;
      Orosol® is a medical device, osmotically active viscous solution. Applied to the surface of&#xD;
      an ulcer, it forms a film and mechanically attracts the hypotonic fluid present under the&#xD;
      injured surface, thus cleaning the ulcer of all contaminants present on the surface (dead&#xD;
      cells, cell debris, bacterial toxins and chemical agents. toxic) and reducing pain and&#xD;
      burning sensation. This mechanical action also cleanses the ulcer of toxic substances that&#xD;
      inhibit cell growth and paves the way for healing. This device (class 1) is a medical device&#xD;
      that complies with the requirements set by European regulations for the treatment of oral&#xD;
      mucositis and has shown improvement in a preliminary study in patients with chemo-induced&#xD;
      mucositis. However, its effectiveness has not yet been tested in the case of&#xD;
      radiation-induced mucositis. The main objective of the research is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the curative treatment with Orosol® on the symptoms of chemo-induced or&#xD;
      radiation-induced mucositis in patients treated for cancer by the evaluation at 28 days of&#xD;
      the evolution of the mucositis via mucositis (WHO and NCI-CTCAE v3.0 scales) and food (WHO&#xD;
      scales and functional signs of NCI-CTCAE v4.0) scores. The secondary objectives consist in&#xD;
      evaluating during the treatment the mucositis score, the general state of health of the&#xD;
      mouth, the burning sensation, the intensity of the pain on D1, D3, D5, D7, D14, D21 and D28&#xD;
      as well as analgesic consumption, the incidence of new ulcers, changes in anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment linked to mucositis and the tolerance of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, bicenter study to establish CE compliance in&#xD;
      a new indication. 54 adult patients, treated by chemotherapy for haematological cancer or&#xD;
      radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy for head and neck cancer, with CTCAE grade ≥ 2 mucositis&#xD;
      and agreeing not to take any treatment other than that studied (except the treatment&#xD;
      symptomatic of mucositis recommended by the WHO), will be recruited during their treatment in&#xD;
      the specialized services of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital or the Jean Perrin&#xD;
      Center over a period estimated at 24 months. After information, collection of consent and&#xD;
      verification of the selection criteria, patients will receive according to randomization (1:&#xD;
      1 stratified according to radio / chemotherapy) either the active treatment or a placebo.&#xD;
      During the first visit, a clinical examination with evaluation of the grade of mucositis (WHO&#xD;
      scale and clinical signs NCI-CTCAE v3.0), photographs of ulcers (retrospective control),&#xD;
      evaluation of the state of the mouth (OAG (Oral Assessment Guide) grid), difficulty in&#xD;
      feeding by the oral route (functional signs NCI- CTCAE v4.0) will be performed as well as&#xD;
      assessments (VAS (Visual Analogic Scales) of pain and burning sensations before and 30&#xD;
      minutes after treatment. Visits are scheduled on D3, D5, D7, D14, D21 and D28 with clinical&#xD;
      examination, photographs, evaluations of the condition of the mouth, difficulty in feeding,&#xD;
      pain and burning sensation, collection of any adverse effects and changes in the anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment if necessary.&#xD;

    <description>Orosol® is a 20 ml aluminum bottle equipped with a spray without propellant gas for local application. Simply shake the bottle gently, apply the product to the injured surface by pressing your finger on the spray to deliver the product (4 to 5 times so as to form a thin film on the surface of the mouth) . It is recommended to use Orosol® every 2 hours at the start of treatment and then 3 to 4 times a day. The maximum duration of treatment will be 28 days. Eating or drinking should be avoided for the first 15 to 30 minutes after applying the product.</description>
