  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain education has proven difficult to implement into clinical practice. In Denmark 4 out of&#xD;
      10 adults has inadequate health literacy levels. To avoid inequality in health care we need a&#xD;
      new and accurate method to provide pain education to all who need it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, existing concept of pain education is implemented into clinical practice for a&#xD;
      group of chronic pain patients including those with low degrees of health literacy, and then&#xD;
      evaluate its use from both patient and physiotherapist perspective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this is project is to implement existing knowledge into clinical practice and to&#xD;
      adapt and test a tool (i.e., PNE4Kids) that was initially developed to explain pain to&#xD;
      children and their parents, for its potential to teach adults in pain about contemporary pain&#xD;
      science in a way that takes into consideration those with low degrees of health literacy.&#xD;
      Further, we want to test its feasibility in adult pain patients at a community-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation center. It is expected that adult patients suffering from chronic pain will&#xD;
      find the adapted PNE4Kids, named PNE4Adults, comprehendible, will benefit from this type of&#xD;
      pain education in terms of increased pain knowledge and self-efficacy, and decreased&#xD;
      pain-intensity and pain catastrophizing thoughts. It is also expected that physiotherapists&#xD;
      will find the pain education program easy to engage with and to transfer into a clinical&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After a period of &quot;usual care&quot; for 2-4 weeks, we want to cross-over and add the pain education intervention.&#xD;
The pain education intervention is an add-on to &quot;usual care&quot; and consists of an individualized pain education program in the form of Danish PNE4Adults. The education program consists of two session of +/- 1 hour each tailored individually to the needs of the patient. After the pain education, the patient will continue the planned rehabilitation program, but will integrate the knowledge obtained through the pain education, as an integrated part of the PNE4Adults program.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To assess adults' beliefs and knowledge of pain science, a Danish version of the Concept of Pain Inventory (COPI-adult) is used. It is a 13-item self-reported questionnaire with the following response options; &quot;strongly disagree&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot;, &quot;unsure&quot;, &quot;agree&quot;, &quot;strongly agree&quot;.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire which measures how confident a person feels in dealing with everyday life despite having chronic pain. The PSEQ consists of 10 items, rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not confident at all&quot;) to 6 (&quot;very confident&quot;).</description>

    <description>Pain intensity is assessed on Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) with answer options ranging from 0 = (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 = (&quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;). We will collect average pain intensity last 24 hours (NRSavg), worst pain intensity last 24 hours (NRSmax) and current pain intensity (NRScur) as they all seem to convey different aspects of pain and together provide a more accurate measure of pain.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire to assess catastrophizing in relation to actual or anticipated pain. The questionnaire has 3 sub-scales (i.e., rumination, magnification, and helplessness) and contains a total of 13-items. Patients use the same 5-point Likert-scale to respond to all 13 items ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much so&quot;</description>
