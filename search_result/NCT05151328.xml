    <measure>Number of Durable Overall CSBM Responders, Mean Replacement Approach</measure>
    <time_frame>12-Week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of patients who are overall Complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) responders during the 12-week Treatment Period. A CSBM weekly responder is defined as a patient who has ≥ 3 CSBMs per week and an increase from baseline of ≥ 1 CSBM for that week. An overall CSBM responder is a patient who is a weekly CSBM responder for at least 9 of the 12 treatment weeks, including at least 3 of the last 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in CSBMs (CSBMs/Week) Over the 12-week Treatment Period , Mean Replacement Approach</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in the number of Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movements (CSBMs) over the 12-week Treatment Period was analyzed. Baseline was the mean number of CSBMs recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug. A CSBM was a bowel movement that occurred in the absence of laxative use within 24 hours and was associated with the feeling of complete evacuation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in SBMs (SBMs/Week) Over the 12-week Treatment Period, Mean Replacement Approach</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in the number of Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) over the 12-week Treatment Period was analyzed. Baseline was the mean number of SBMs recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug. The weekly SBM totals were derived from the daily diary entries reported during the Treatment Period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Weekly SBM Stool Consistency Over the 12-week Treatment Period, Mean Replacement Approach</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in the stool consistency score (i.e. BSFS) over the 12-week Treatment Period was analyzed. Baseline was the mean BSFS score recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug. The weekly mean BSFS score per patient was derived from the BSFS entries reported during the Treatment Period in the Daily Symptom Diary.&#xD;
The stool consistency of each bowel movement (BM) was assessed by patients using the 7-point Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS] from 1 to 7.&#xD;
separate hard lumps like nuts (difficult to pass)&#xD;
sausage shaped but lumpy&#xD;
like a sausage but with cracks on its surface&#xD;
like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft&#xD;
soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily)&#xD;
fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool&#xD;
watery, no solid pieces (entirely liquid)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Weekly Straining Score Over the 12-week Treatment Period, Mean Replacement Approach</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in the straining score over the 12-week Treatment Period was analyzed. Baseline was the mean of non-missing straining scores recorded during the 2-week baseline diary assessment period prior to the first dose of study drug. The weekly average straining score was derived from the straining scores reported during the Treatment Period in the Daily Symptom Diary. The severity of straining during bowel movements was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = very severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For weeks 4, 8, and 12 (EOT), the treatment satisfaction question on Patient Global Assessment(PAG) questionnaires will be analyzed separately at each visit using an ANCOVA with fixed effects for gender (stratification variable) and treatment. (Grade 1-5; 1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=very severe)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First CSBMs and SBMs, Mean Replacement Approach</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Times to first CSBM and first SBM will be defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of the first SBM and CSBM, respectively. Patients who have not had an SBM will be censored at the time of their first ingestion of rescue medication (not less than 72 hours after first dose of study drug) or at the time of Early Withdrawal, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
The primary analysis of time to first SBM will be to compare each plecanatide treatment versus placebo via a 2-sided log-rank test, stratified by gender. The functions of time to first SBM for each treatment group will be estimated using the K-M product-limit method. Two-sided, 95% CIs for median time to first SBM and other quartiles will be computed, by treatment group.&#xD;
A similar analysis will be done for time to first CSBM</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Symptoms Associated With Constipation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported daily symptoms associated with constipation, measured using the 5-point score (0-4 rating), for the Treatment Period will be the average of non-missing patient scores by week, reported during that period. Comparisons will be made of changes from baseline for each parameter between each plecanatide treatment group and placebo, using a linear mixed-effect model under the assumption of normally distributed residuals with treatment group, week, interaction of treatment and week, gender and the corresponding baseline value as fixed effects and random intercept for patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to use of rescue medication will be defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of the first use of provided rescue medication (Dulcolax®). Patients who haven't taken Dulcolax® will be censored at the time of their last rescue medication assessment or at the time of their Early Withdrawal, whichever is earliest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Assessments include constipation severity, change in constipation symptoms and treatment assessments will be reported at (where applicable) Day 1 Pre-dose, Weeks, 4, 8, and 12 or (End of treatment) EOT and (End of study) EOS. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics on observed data and change from baseline (where applicable). In addition, each assessment will be analyzed separately at each visit using an ANCOVA with fixed effects for gender (stratification variable) and treatment.&#xD;
In addition, a responder analyses based on change in constipation symptoms will be performed:&#xD;
Patient's response is minimally improved or better (i.e., score ≤ 3), or Patient's response is much improved or better (i.e., score ≤ 2)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
