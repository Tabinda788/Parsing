  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HFNO and NIV strategies are the most commonly used strategies for the treatment of hypoxia in&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who are still followed in the intensive care unit, but&#xD;
      there is no study comparing the two yet. In our prospective study, we aimed to compare these&#xD;
      two treatment modalities. The primary goal is that the treatment is successful (weaned off&#xD;
      HFNO/weaned off NIV: No need for HFNO or NIV and the patient recovers without the need for&#xD;
      intubation). Failure will be evaluated as the need for intubation during treatment or the&#xD;
      patient's death. Secondary aim is failure of treatment and discharge of patients from&#xD;
      intensive care to service or home.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is a deadly infection that causes a new type of severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome. It has been reported that the mortality rate in critically ill&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 reached 61%. The primary pathology in these patients is&#xD;
      progressive hypoxia due to lung injury and associated multi-organ damage. It has been&#xD;
      reported that aggressive treatments such as tracheal intubation and classical mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation to treat lung injury are not helpful or even harmful. The highest mortality rate&#xD;
      was reported as 86% in these patients on mechanical ventilation. Acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) developing in COVID-19 infection is not typical and is estimated to have a&#xD;
      different mechanism, therefore it is emphasized that different strategies should be used for&#xD;
      the treatment of ARDS in these patients. Two of the most important strategies used in these&#xD;
      patients followed in the intensive care unit are high flow nasal oxygenation (High Flow Nasal&#xD;
      Oxygenation-HFNO) and non-invasive ventilation (Non-Invasive Ventilation-NIV). HFNO is a&#xD;
      method frequently used before intubation in adult patients with acute respiratory failure. It&#xD;
      is based on the principle of giving warm and humidified oxygen to the patient through a nasal&#xD;
      cannula in the range of 1-70 L/min. Due to the low number of mechanical ventilators in many&#xD;
      intensive care units at the beginning of the pandemic, it was used in many COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      and was found to be effective in later retrospective analyzes. It has been reported in many&#xD;
      studies that HFNO therapy is more effective than conventional mask oxygen therapy. There are&#xD;
      publications stating that it is more advantageous compared to NIV as it is easier to apply&#xD;
      and more comfortable for the patient. Conventional NIV is called continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) or Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation. It is used as&#xD;
      oxygen/ventilation therapy in SARS and H1N1 patients. Studies have reported that it is used&#xD;
      in 70% of patients before tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. However, mortality was&#xD;
      high in these patients.&#xD;
