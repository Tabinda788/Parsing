    <textblock>
      This study will look to increase the donor pool for the solid organ transplant population by&#xD;
      transplanting patients who died with COVID-19 but not from COVID-19 utilizing casirivimab and&#xD;
      imdevimab antibody cocktail to prevent the transmission of the virus.&#xD;

      This is single-center, proof of concept study that is expected to last up to three months.&#xD;
      The target enrollment for this study is 14 subjects ≥18 years of age with a need of a kidney,&#xD;
      liver or heart. This study will investigate the effects of the investigational product during&#xD;
      a four-week intervention phase followed by a 12-month observation phase. Study population&#xD;
      will be derived from patients in Northwell Health Transplant Center.&#xD;
