  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the combined effects&#xD;
      of meal variety and portion size on food intake at a meal. The study will also explore&#xD;
      relationships with eating microstructure such as eating rate and bite size. Additionally,&#xD;
      other individual characteristics will be examined for their influence on the effects of&#xD;
      variety and portion size on meal intake.&#xD;
