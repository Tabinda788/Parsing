      Multinational Observational Cohort of HIV and other Infections (MOCHI). This observational&#xD;
      study is to gain information regarding the number of new HIV infections among people who&#xD;
      engage in behaviors that make them vulnerable to acquiring HIV across multiple international&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a multi-site prospective observational cohort of males and females who are&#xD;
      vulnerable to HIV and other STIs. Step 1 of the study is the evaluation of participants&#xD;
      without HIV with quarterly follow up visits up to 72 weeks. At each follow up visit, we will&#xD;
      administer behavioral questionnaires, HIV testing, STI testing, and other laboratory testing&#xD;
      per the schedule of evaluations. Participants will also perform home-based HIV testing&#xD;
      between study visits per the schedule of evaluations. Step 2 is the incident HIV acquisition&#xD;
      evaluation. Follow-up visits will be conducted every four weeks up to 12 weeks after initial&#xD;
      HIV diagnosis and then quarterly up to 48 weeks. Individuals will be monitored for HIV&#xD;
      disease outcomes, STIs, and surveys, and other lab collections will be administered per the&#xD;
      schedule of evaluations. Participants who are virally-suppressed at the completion of Step 2&#xD;
      will transition to Step 3 for long-term follow-up semi-annually out to week 192. Evaluation&#xD;
      will primarily be HIV monitoring, surveys for consideration of trial participation, and&#xD;
      specimen storage per the schedule of evaluations.&#xD;

    <description>For the analysis of the incidence rate, only individuals who are not living with HIV at the baseline exam will be included in the incidence rate analysis.&#xD;
People without HIV will contribute person-time beginning with the time they enter the study until the study concludes or they are either censored or an HIV transmission event occurs. The event time for each subject is set to the minimum of the HIV transmission event time or the censoring time caused by one of the following: a drop-out event, a death event, or study end event. If one of these censoring events occurs, the censoring time is set to the last time there is recorded data for the subject. If an individual tests positive for HIV during the study, the HIV transmission event time is set to the visit during which the HIV transmission occurred. Those individuals who are lost to follow-up after enrollment will be censored at the last visit.</description>

    <measure>Establish Incidence and Prevalence of STIs Including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, and Mycoplasma genitalium</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>For incident cases, the date of the positive test will be used as the date of infection. Specifically, for syphilis, a positive test can be determined by one of the following algorithms: 1. In the traditional algorithm, a non-treponemal test (e.g., rapid plasma reagin [RPR] or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test [VDRL]) is used as the initial screen and reactive samples are confirmed with a treponemal test (e.g., fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS], T. pallidum particle agglutination [TPPA] test, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TPHA], or Syphilis IgG) or other tests that detect targets specific to T. pallidum. 2. The reverse algorithm uses a treponemal test for screening with reactive samples followed up with a non-treponemal test.</description>

    <measure>Willingness to Participate and Other Calculations</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Willingness to participate in an HIV vaccine trial and study retention rates and their respective 95% CIs will be estimated assuming a binomial distribution. Factors associated with willingness to participate in vaccine trial will be evaluated using logistic regression models. Self-reported risk behavior over time will be assessed by frequency tables and bar graphs. Changes in risk behavior over time will be evaluated using a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model with clustering occurring within individuals (ex: multiple observations per person). Knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding behaviors and preventive measures will be evaluated using descriptive statistics.</description>
