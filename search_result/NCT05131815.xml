  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, interventional, single-arm pilot study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether virtually delivered group-based physical activity is feasible for adolescent and&#xD;
      young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. AYAs who were diagnosed with cancer and have completed&#xD;
      cancer treatment will be recruited for this study. This study will enroll 20 participants in&#xD;
      total and will last approximately 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective, interventional pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of cancer (n=20) will engage in three months of&#xD;
      virtually group physical activity (PA) delivered via BurnAlong, a wellness platform and&#xD;
      online app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to engage in a BurnAlong workout session with a partner&#xD;
      (friend/spouse/child/fellow study participant) a minimum of two times a week for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also meet monthly with an exercise physiologist for a customized exercise&#xD;
      session. Participants are allowed to engage in additional PA and non-PA sessions on BurnAlong&#xD;
      as desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to engage in a private social network discussions around key&#xD;
      topics of interest for AYA communities with a focus on post-traumatic growth and positive&#xD;
      psychology with a minimum of 2 post engagements a week for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys and physical assessments at baseline and at end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants also have the option to participate in a 1 hr qualitative exit interview about&#xD;
      their well-being, participation experiences, and experience with using the BurnAlong&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
