    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a longitudinal health, demographics, and pregnancy&#xD;
      surveillance study in Lusaka, Zambia to precisely characterize the pregnancy rate, pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes, health and disease burden of women of reproductive age and their children under 2&#xD;
      years prior to, during, and following pregnancy and to investigate the structural,&#xD;
      socio-demographic, and clinical covariates that contribute to adverse outcomes in each&#xD;
      reproductive epoch.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal household panel survey to describe the health of approximately 5,500&#xD;
      women of reproductive age (WRA) and their children &lt; 2 years of age and investigate the&#xD;
      structural, sociodemographic, and clinical risk factors and vulnerabilities that contribute&#xD;
      to adverse outcomes. Households will be visited quarterly for up to 36 months. A head of&#xD;
      household (defined as an adult &gt; 18 years old residing in and knowledgeable about the&#xD;
      household), each WRA in the household, and children &lt;2 years will be surveyed quarterly for&#xD;
      24 months (a parent or next-of-kin will respond on behalf of the child). Women with prevalent&#xD;
      or incident pregnancy and their infants will be followed for a minimum of 12 months from&#xD;
      delivery. Approximately 2,000 children will be enrolled over the course of the study.&#xD;
