  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory activities in the gastrointestinal tract are accompanied by an increase in blood&#xD;
      flow in the intestinal wall layers of the respective organs. Also in chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel diseases, the release of vasoactive inflammatory mediators leads to vasodilation and&#xD;
      consecutive increase of blood flow in the bowel wall. So far, these changes in blood flow can&#xD;
      be detected by power Doppler sonography without being part of routine clinical diagnostics.&#xD;
      Another promising option for non-invasive measurement of blood flow in the intestinal wall is&#xD;
      Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT). Previous studies have shown that MSOT can be&#xD;
      used to quantitatively measure hemoglobin in the bowel wall and thus provide information on&#xD;
      blood flow and inflammatory activity in the intestines of patients with Crohn's disease. This&#xD;
      is currently being further investigated in a pivotal study (Euphoria, H2020) and could lead&#xD;
      to the possibility of non-invasive assessment of disease activity in inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease (IBD) in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regional blood flow in the intestinal wall and the distribution of gastrointestinal blood&#xD;
      flow are also subject to strong postprandial changes. During absorption of food components,&#xD;
      blood flow increases sequentially in the respective sections of the gastrointestinal tract,&#xD;
      leading to postprandial hyperemia. Because postprandial hyperemia is particularly regulated&#xD;
      locally by the presence of dietary components, there is a relationship between the sequential&#xD;
      increase in blood flow in the intestinal wall and the peristaltic transport of chyme through&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract. Postprandial hyperemia could also lead to an increase in the&#xD;
      optoacoustic hemoglobin signal of the intestinal wall and thus have an impact on the&#xD;
      assessment of inflammatory activity in IBD using MSOT. Additionally, MSOT allows the&#xD;
      identification of non-absorbable exogenous chromophores, such as indocyanine green (ICG),&#xD;
      which could allow co-localization of the chyme in the intestinal lumen after oral application&#xD;
      of ICG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study investigates whether postprandial blood flow changes can be quantitatively&#xD;
      measured using MSOT and whether these changes occur simultaneously with the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      passage of the chyme as measured by the ICG signal in the intestinal lumen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal tract essentially fulfills two major functions: digestion and absorption&#xD;
      of food, and physical and immunological barrier against environmental influences. These basic&#xD;
      functions are critically dependent on splanchnic blood flow at both the macrovascular and&#xD;
      microvascular levels. In particular, advances in vascular biology have revealed a central and&#xD;
      intricate role of blood circulation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, changes in blood flow have been used as surrogate markers for altered inflammatory&#xD;
      activity in the intestine, e.g., by Doppler sonographic detection. Multispectral Optoacoustic&#xD;
      Tomograph (MSOT) allows for non-invasive, quantitative imaging of the molecular composition&#xD;
      of target tissues. In MSOT, similar to conventional sonography, a transducer is placed on the&#xD;
      skin but energy is delivered to the tissue by means of laser light in the near infrared&#xD;
      spectrum instead of ultrasound waves. This leads to a constant alternation of minimal&#xD;
      expansions and contractions (thermoelastic expansion) of individual tissue components or&#xD;
      molecules. The resulting ultrasound waves can subsequently be detected by the same&#xD;
      examination unit. Previous studies have shown that quantitative determination of hemoglobin&#xD;
      can provide information on blood flow and inflammatory activity in the intestine of adult&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease. In particular, the distinction between the activity levels of&#xD;
      the disease (remission/low/moderate/high) is promising for saving invasive measures in the&#xD;
      future when evaluating the progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to inflammatory processes, food intake also causes fluctuations in regional blood&#xD;
      flow in the gastrointestinal tract. This manifests as postprandial hyperemia, which occurs&#xD;
      sequentially in the different sections of the gastrointestinal tract from oral to aboral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time course of postprandial hyperemia in the different sections of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract has been scientifically investigated in many studies. While an increase in blood flow&#xD;
      in the stomach and duodenum can be detected after 30-60 minutes, it takes much longer for&#xD;
      postprandial hyperemia to be detected in the areas used to measure inflammatory activity with&#xD;
      MSOT in IBD such as the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon. An increase in blood flow in the&#xD;
      ileum can be measured after 120 minutes at the earliest, and the arrival of chyme in the&#xD;
      colon and the accompanying local increase in blood flow occur after approximately 240-300&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear whether this postprandial hyperemia can lead to a change and potential increase&#xD;
      in the optoacoustic hemoglobin signal of the intestinal wall, resulting in falsely high MSOT&#xD;
      signals in the determination of inflammatory activity. This study investigates influences of&#xD;
      a standardized dietary on the MSOT signal of the intestinal wall using a longitudinal design.&#xD;
      Optoacoustic signals will be compared between subjects in fasting and postprandial states.&#xD;
      Because the postprandial increase in intestinal blood flow is predominantly a result of the&#xD;
      local presence of chyme in the intestine, a simultaneous determination of intestinal transit&#xD;
      of chyme during MSOT measurement would be helpful to validate whether postprandial changes in&#xD;
      MSOT signals are attributable to hyperemia in the corresponding bowel segment. Besides&#xD;
      imaging of hemoglobin, MSOT enables the detection of exogenous chromophores (i.e. dyes). In&#xD;
      this study, the oral administration of the nonabsorbable dye indocyanine green (ICG) will be&#xD;
      used for noninvasive identification of the chyme. The combination of exogenous and endogenous&#xD;
      chromophores thus allows accurate co-localization and registration of intestinal wall blood&#xD;
      flow patterns and chyme transit. This information enables accurate anatomical mapping of&#xD;
      interfering influences on the determination of hemoglobin using MSOT.&#xD;
