      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of T-lymphocytes in resected tumor samples derived from long-term survival&#xD;
      patients and the fact that reinvigoration of their functionality through the administration&#xD;
      of specific immune-therapies can lead to remarkable antitumor responses supports that&#xD;
      lymphocytes play a critical role in cancer immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoptive cell therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes product (TIL-ACT) is a&#xD;
      well-established combination therapy currently under study in several world reference&#xD;
      centers, using an autologous cell product without genetic modifications. This cell product&#xD;
      consists of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), which are collected from the patient and&#xD;
      expanded in the lab under specific conditions to enhance its antitumoral efficacy before&#xD;
      reinfusion in the same patient. However, this cell product alone does not achieve adequate&#xD;
      efficacy, and a combination of both previous non-myeloablative lymphodepleting (NMA-LD)&#xD;
      chemotherapy and subsequent cytokine therapy (specifically IL-2) is needed to support the&#xD;
      expansion of the infused cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that TILs enriched for neoantigen recognition are superior to&#xD;
      unselected TILs at mediating tumor regression in patients with epithelial tumors and even&#xD;
      other solid tumors where immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is approved and used as part of&#xD;
      standard therapy. The investigators propose to manufacture a T-cell product composed of TILs&#xD;
      that are selected based on their ability to recognize patient-specific neoantigens and to use&#xD;
      these to treat patients with metastatic, refractory, epithelial cancers, as well as&#xD;
      ICB-resistant solid tumors. Furthermore, it also proposed to study the tumor and T cells at&#xD;
      baseline and after treatment to investigate whether specific phenotypic and functional traits&#xD;
      may be associated with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and the tolerability of ex vivo next generation neoantigen-selected&#xD;
      Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) in patients with metastatic or unresectable epithelial&#xD;
      tumors and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the success in producing active specific TILs from our target patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the initial clinical activity of the NEXTGEN-TIL products in our target&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a first-in-human, open-label, non-controlled, single-centre, phase I trial to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of NEXTGEN-TIL-ACT. Given the exploratory nature of the&#xD;
      study, there is no formal hypothesis testing and no formal sample size calculation was&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 10 patients has been selected to provide information about the frequency of&#xD;
      treatment-limiting toxicity (TLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study therapy is the Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocyte (NEXTGEN-TIL) product, which is&#xD;
      preceded by a preparative non-myeloablative lymphodepleting (NMA-DL) regimen and followed by&#xD;
      IL-2 infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEXTGEN-TIL product is a cellular investigational product comprising a live cell suspension&#xD;
      of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from the patient's own tumor.&#xD;
