  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective, single-centre randomized controlled trial is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of tadalafil 5 mg on post-micturition dribble (PMD) in young age men&#xD;
      (18-50 years) with no/mild lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-micturition dribble (PMD), a post-voiding symptom, is defined as involuntary loss of&#xD;
      urine immediately after urination. It is more common in males. Many population/practice-based&#xD;
      studies have shown that PMD is one of the most common bothersome urinary symptoms in adult&#xD;
      males ranging from 5.5 % to 29 %. (1, 2) In young age men (less than 50 years) with absence&#xD;
      of prostate-associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), PMD is considered the most&#xD;
      devastating urinary complaint with worsened physical and mental health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL). (3) Pathophysiology of PMD is usually attributed to residual urine in the&#xD;
      bulbar urethra whatever the cause. Many theories, including weakness or failure of the pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscles, incompetency of the external urethral sphincter or bladder neck obstruction,&#xD;
      were suggested for this urine residue. (4) However, in patients with PMD with no/mild LUTS,&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle weakness especially the bulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus muscles is&#xD;
      usually the main putative mechanism. (5) Bulbar urethral massage and pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      exercise have been proposed as useful options for patients with PMD (6); yet, pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment has not been standardized for those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this perspective, recent studies have shown that corpus cavernosum structural changes may&#xD;
      be related to PMD. (7) It is well known that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) isoenzymes are&#xD;
      highly expressed in the urethra as well as the corpus cavernosum, bladder and prostate. (8)&#xD;
      In addition, once-daily 5 mg tadalafil, a PDE-5 inhibitor, has previously been used to treat&#xD;
      voiding and storage LUTS. In addition, tadalafil once daily showed reduced PMD symptom&#xD;
      severity and PMD volume in men with PMD and other LUTS. (9) Notably, this study included old&#xD;
      age men (mean age 62 years) with moderate or severe LUTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of taking tadalafil 5 mg once daily&#xD;
      on PMD in young men (18-50 years) with minimal/mild LUTS.&#xD;

    <description>Our prospective, randomized, study will consist of a 1-week baseline period and 12-week double-blind treatment period During the baseline period, patients' characteristics, including medical and sexual history, physical examination results, vital signs, HPMDQ score, IPSS, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, PMD volume, and uroflowmetry results; and laboratory results, including urine analysis results, will be recorded.&#xD;
After the baseline period, patients will be randomly assigned, 1:1, to the treatment or control groups using a computer-generated system. Both study groups will be advised to do bulbar urethral massage in addition to pelvic floor muscle exercise (explained later) during the study period, treatment group will be given tadalafil 5 mg (treatment group) daily or no medication (control group).</description>
