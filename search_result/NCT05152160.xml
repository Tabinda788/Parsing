      cGVHD is a systemic disease with multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune&#xD;
      diseases. It can affect multiple organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves,&#xD;
      causing a serious decline in the quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of&#xD;
      transplantation. According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group)&#xD;
      revised by the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the&#xD;
      3-year survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 ± 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6&#xD;
      points) about 84.9 ± 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 ± 4.4%, rRG4 (≥10 points) about 32.0&#xD;
      ± 1.1%, it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of&#xD;
      allo-HSCT patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the&#xD;
      prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment&#xD;
      is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants,&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term&#xD;
      survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time,&#xD;
      which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the&#xD;
      treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment&#xD;
      of cGVHD.&#xD;

      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) refers to the clinicopathological synthesis of&#xD;
      lymphocytes from the donor attacking the recipient's organs during the process of rebuilding&#xD;
      the donor's immunity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)&#xD;
      Signs (including classic cGVHD and overlap syndrome) are one of the main complications after&#xD;
      transplantation, with an incidence of 30% to 70%. cGVHD is a systemic disease with&#xD;
      multi-system damage similar to autoimmune and other immune diseases. It can affect multiple&#xD;
      organs such as skin, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves, causing a serious decline in the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients, and death in the late stage of transplantation. main reason.&#xD;
      According to the cGVHD prognostic risk scoring system (revised Risk Group) revised by the&#xD;
      European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in 2017, the 3-year&#xD;
      survival rate of patients with rRG1 (0-3 points) is about 93.3 ± 6.4%, and rRG2 (4-6 points)&#xD;
      About 84.9 ± 3.4%, rRG3 (7-9 points) about 70.9 ± 4.4%, rRG4 (≥10 points) about 32.0 ± 1.1%,&#xD;
      it can be seen that moderate to severe cGVHD directly affects the survival of allo-HSCT&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once moderate or severe cGVHD is diagnosed, glucocorticoids with or without calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor (CNI) are first-line drugs, but the effective rate is less than 50%, and the&#xD;
      prognosis of hormone-resistant severe cGVHD is extremely poor even if second-line treatment&#xD;
      is added. Second-line treatments include monoclonal antibodies, immunosuppressants,&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs, phototherapy or others. Most of them cannot improve the long-term&#xD;
      survival rate. The main reason is that these treatments suppress immunity for a long time,&#xD;
      which increases the risk of infection and reduces the survival rate. In this context, the&#xD;
      treatment of mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) provides a new path for clinical treatment&#xD;
      of cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2002, Frassoni reported for the first time that MSCs expanded in vitro were used to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT transplanted patients with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies were enrolled. MSCs were derived from the donor's bone marrow. After expanded in&#xD;
      vitro, participants were combined with the donor's hematopoietic stem cells for reinfusion.&#xD;
      As a result, the incidence of aGVHD in the MSCs expansion group and cGVHD within 6 months was&#xD;
      significantly lower in the control group, the 6-month OS was significantly higher than that&#xD;
      in the control group, and there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate.&#xD;
      Subsequently, in 2004, Le Blanc and others successfully used third-party MSCs to successfully&#xD;
      treat a refractory grade IV intestinal combined with liver aGVHD for the first time.&#xD;
      Subsequently, MSCs were increasingly used in clinical studies for the treatment of GVHD. More&#xD;
      clinical trials have shown that umbilical cord-derived MSCs cultured in vitro can not only&#xD;
      promote the implantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), but also reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      severe GVHD in patients, showing a good therapeutic effect.&#xD;
