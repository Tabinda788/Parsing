  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are an important zinc enzyme group that responsible for&#xD;
      reducing extracellular matrix components. It has been reported that MMPs play an important&#xD;
      role in pulpal inflammation. The aims of this in vivo study was to compare the expression&#xD;
      levels of MMP-2, -8 and -9 in primary molars with reversible and irreversible pulpitis and to&#xD;
      compare the clinically and radiographically success of MTA and Biodentine materials at the&#xD;
      end of 18 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of 63 mandibular primary second molar teeth of 57 healthy and cooperative children&#xD;
      aged between 5-10 years were included in this study. The Ethical Committee of the Medical&#xD;
      Faculty of Ege University approved the study (Reference No: 16-7/14). Detailed treatment plan&#xD;
      was explained to the children and their parents and written informed consents were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical radiographs were obtained pre-operatively. Patients with a tooth showing clinical&#xD;
      or radiographic evidence of a deep carious lesion extending close or into the pulp chamber&#xD;
      were considered for potential inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cooperative pediatric patients aged 5-10 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deep carious lesion in mandibular primary second molars,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects did not receive any antiinflammatory medication 3 months prior to the&#xD;
           study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasible restorative treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive parental informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncooperative children,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with medically compromised disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of pathological root resorption and/or bone defect,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiological root resorption more than one-third of the root,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unrestorable teeth,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative parental informed consent. The teeth were assigned to different groups&#xD;
           according to the clinical diagnosis. The diagnosis were based on strict clinical and&#xD;
           radiographic criteria. When the dental pulp was exposed during caries removal, the&#xD;
           following clinical and radiographic diagnostic criteria were applied; Group I (teeth&#xD;
           with reversible pulpitis): Slight clinical symptoms of minor intensity, slightly&#xD;
           exaggerated reaction to cold or sweet stimuli, no history of pain, no sensitivity to&#xD;
           chewing or percussion, bleeding time from the exposed pulp tissue less than 5 minutes,&#xD;
           and no widening of the periodontal ligament space. In pulpotomy group teeth with pulpal&#xD;
           exposure smaller than a pinpoint, teeth with purulent/viscous, dark colored exudate&#xD;
           detected at the exposure site, and necrotic teeth were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II (teeth with irreversible pulpitis): Spontanous pain, sensitivity to chewing or&#xD;
      percussion, bleeding time from the exposed pulp tissue more than 5 minutes, and widening of&#xD;
      the periodontal ligament space, periapical lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ethical reasons, there was no control group with blood samples from healthy caries-free&#xD;
      teeth. All primary molars were distributed between the two treatment groups as pulpotomy&#xD;
      (Group I, n=42) and pulpectomy (Group II, n=21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulpotomy procedures and all sampling were performed by the same operator (H.E.G.)&#xD;
      following the procedure as follows: local anesthesia (2% lidocaine (1:000,000)-Jetokain&#xD;
      Simplex, Adeka, Turkey) was administered, and teeth were isolated by a rubberdam (Roeko&#xD;
      Dental Dam, Coltane, Whaledent, Germany). The carious dentin was removed from the cavity,&#xD;
      working from the periphery towards the center using a low-speed round bur (no:4). The roof of&#xD;
      the pulp chamber was removed, and coronal pulp tissue was taken using a sharp excavator. All&#xD;
      pulp samples were placed in 1 ml Tri Pure Reagent transport medium in pre-weighed Eppendorf&#xD;
      tubes. The samples were weighed again and their weights were noted before they were stored at&#xD;
      -80°C until the laboratory procedures. In pulpectomy group (Group II), all sampling&#xD;
      procedures were performed as same in pulpotomy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group I, after removal of the coronal pulp, the cavity was irrigated with sterile saline,&#xD;
      and initial bleeding was controlled by placing sterile cotton pellets moisturized with saline&#xD;
      over the radicular pulp stump exerting slight pressure and waiting for 5 min. The teeth for&#xD;
      which hemostasis at the canal orifices could be achieved in 5 min were included to this&#xD;
      group. The randomization was performed as two groups in a 1 : 1 ratio by using free online&#xD;
      software (http://www.random.org). Following the randomization procedure, patients were&#xD;
      assigned sequential numbers in the order of enrolment and the operator was informed about the&#xD;
      material, either with MTA (n=21) or with Biodentine (n=21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTA Group: According to the manufacturer's instructions, MTA (Pro Root White MTA, Dentsply,&#xD;
      Tulsa Dental Specialties, USA) powder was mixed with sterile water in a 3:1 powder/water&#xD;
      ratio to obtain a thick creamy paste, then placed on the floor of the pulp chamber. The MTA&#xD;
      mixture was covered with a moistened cotton pellet and then temporarily sealed using glass&#xD;
      ionomer cement (GIC-Ketac Molar Easymix, 3M Espe, Seefeld, Germany) until the second visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodentine Group: Biodentine (Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France) capsule was gently&#xD;
      tapped on a hard surface to diffuse powder, five drops of liquid from the single dose&#xD;
      dispenser were poured into the capsule and then mixed with 4200 rpm 30 seconds and placed&#xD;
      over the pulp stumps using an appropriate spatula advised by the manufacturer. After allowing&#xD;
      Biodentine to set for 12 min, the teeth were temporarily sealed with GIC as same in MTA&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 24 hours, the teeth in both groups were restored with preformed stainless -steel crowns&#xD;
      (3M Espe, Stainless Steel Crowns, Seefeld, Germany). The participants were recalled at 6, 12&#xD;
      and 18 months after the treatment. At each follow-up visit, clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      examinations were performed by two calibrated blinded examiners. All teeth were evaluated&#xD;
      clinically and radiographically according to the criteria: (1) absence of spontaneous pain&#xD;
      and/or sensitivity to pressure, (2) absence of sinus, fistula, edema, and/or abnormal&#xD;
      mobility, (3) absence of radiolucency at the interradicular and/or periapical regions, (4)&#xD;
      absence of internal or external root resorption. The absence of spontaneous pain, pathologic&#xD;
      mobility, tenderness to percussion, swelling, fistula, and gingival inflammation was&#xD;
      considered as a clinical success, whereas the absence of internal/external root resorption&#xD;
      and periapical/furcal radiolucency was considered as a radiographic success. Calcific&#xD;
      metamorphosis of the pulp was not considered as a failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulp tissue was washed in phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany)&#xD;
      for 1 min, cut into small pieces, transferred to cell-culture plates and incubated with&#xD;
      Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL, Life&#xD;
      Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), penicillin-G (100 U⋅mL), streptomycin (100 µg⋅mL) and&#xD;
      Fungizone (0.25 g⋅mL) (GeminiBio-Products Inc., Woodland, CA, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified&#xD;
      atmosphere of 5% CO2. Migration of cells from the pulpal tissue occurred 1 week later, and&#xD;
      cultures were established and maintained in standard culture medium. Medium was refreshed&#xD;
      three times per week, and cells were split, after reaching confluence. Pulp cells between the&#xD;
      third and eighth passages were used in this study (ref).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA was extracted from the treated cells using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan). cDNA&#xD;
      was synthesized from 400 ng of total RNA using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa Bio,&#xD;
      Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of the cDNA obtained was&#xD;
      added for a final volume of 20 µL for each reaction containing SYBR Green I (TaKaRa Bio,&#xD;
      Shiga, Japan). The primers for MMP-2, -8 and -9 were as follows (sense/antisense):&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMP-2: 5'-ATC CTG GCT TTC CCA AGC TC-3'/3'-CAC CCT TGA AGA AGT AGC TGT G-5'.&#xD;
      MMP-8:5'-CTGTTGAAGGCCTAGAGCTGCTGCTCC3'/5'CATCTTCTCTTCAAACTCTACCC-3'. MMP-9: 5'-GGG CTT AGA&#xD;
      TCA TTC CTC AGT G-3'/3'-GCC ATT CAC GTC GTC CTT AT-5'. (ref) Reactions were run on an ABI&#xD;
      Step One real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the following&#xD;
      program: 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 20 s. For relative&#xD;
      comparisons of each gene, we analysed the threshold cycle (Ct) value of the real-time PCR&#xD;
      data using the 2-ΔΔCt method.20 The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel&#xD;
      containing 1 pg/mL ethidium bromide, which attaches to nucleic acids, allowing the PCR&#xD;
      products to be visualized under UV light. The gel was photographed to allow the products to&#xD;
      be quantitated as described below. After finding the linear portion for each set of primers&#xD;
      for quantitation of the products, we quantitated them with an image processing and analyzing&#xD;
      program (ScionImage PC, Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA) to analyze the expression of&#xD;
      MMP-2, -8 and -9.(ref) Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS&#xD;
      for Windows version 25.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analysed using a Fisher Exact Test in addition to chi-square tests to perform&#xD;
      inter- and intra- group comparisons, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fisher's Exact Test was used for testing the levels of MMP-2, -8, -9 expression between&#xD;
      the reversible and irreversible pulpitis groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6, 12 and 18 months clinically and radiographically success of MTA and Biodentine&#xD;
      materials were tested by chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mann Whitney U test was used in comparing the MMP-2, -8, -9 expressions between successful&#xD;
      and failed pulpotomy groups.&#xD;
