  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodynamics in the craniovertebral zone is often disturbed under the influence of a&#xD;
      spondylogenic factor A complication of such changes can be from a slight decrease in cerebral&#xD;
      circulation to ischemic changes in the vascular bed The patients underwent complex radiation&#xD;
      diagnostics of the craniovertebral region of patients with verified Kimmerle's anomaly (N =&#xD;
      62) All examined patients underwent multispiral computed tomography (CT), ultrasound Doppler&#xD;
      and transcranial Doppler (TCD) of the vertebral arteries (VA) Studies of the developmental&#xD;
      variant of the first cervical vertebra with the presence of a bony bridge have shown that&#xD;
      Kimmerle's anomaly can occur in all age groups&#xD;

      The vaulted hole was found in all age groups (more in young and middle age) The detection&#xD;
      rate was within 16 3% of cases, that is, it occurs in every 5-6 people According to TCD data,&#xD;
      Kimmerle's anomaly affects blood flow and was most often detected on both sides of the atlas&#xD;
      In the unilateral variant, the anomaly was noted only on the left side It was found that the&#xD;
      main structural change in the cerebral vascular bed, according to ultrasound diagnostics, is&#xD;
      a change in the straightness of the vertebral arteries in the transverse processes of the&#xD;
      cervical spine, including the atlas It should also be borne in mind that due to the&#xD;
      complexity and mobility of the structure, patients with dysfunction of the craniovertebral&#xD;
      zone receive therapy from doctors of various profiles, which requires a comprehensive&#xD;
      diagnosis of this problem&#xD;
