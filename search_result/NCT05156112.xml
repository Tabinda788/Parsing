  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance use disorder (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur and&#xD;
      having both disorders is associated with greater psychological and functional impairment than&#xD;
      having either disorder alone. This is especially true in residential settings where both&#xD;
      disorders are more severe than outpatient settings. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly&#xD;
      comorbid with both disorders and untreated OSA is associated with worse functional impairment&#xD;
      across multiple domains, worse quality of life, worse PTSD, higher suicidal ideation, and&#xD;
      higher substance use and relapse rates. Treating OSA with evidence-based positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (PAP) in Veterans with SUD/PTSD on a residential unit is a logical way to maximize&#xD;
      treatment adherence and treatment outcomes. This study compares OSA treatment while on a&#xD;
      SUD/PTSD residential unit to a waitlist control group. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      treating OSA on the residential unit, compared to the waitlist control, will have better&#xD;
      functional, SUD, and PTSD outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Substance use disorder (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur and&#xD;
      having one condition worsens the course of the other. Individuals with both disorders exhibit&#xD;
      worse functioning across a number of domains than individuals with either disorder alone.&#xD;
      This is especially true in residential settings where both disorders are more severe than&#xD;
      outpatient settings. Compared to Veterans with a single disorder, Veterans with SUD/PTSD also&#xD;
      are more likely to have suicidal ideation and to have attempted suicide. Examining treatable&#xD;
      conditions that are associated with improved SUD and PTSD outcomes, such as obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA), can maximize treatment efficacy for Veterans at a critical time in recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA is highly comorbid with both PTSD and SUD with upwards of 67 to 83% of Veterans with SUD&#xD;
      or PTSD also having OSA. Further, untreated OSA is associated with worse functional&#xD;
      impairment across multiple domains, worse quality of life, worse PTSD, and higher substance&#xD;
      use and relapse rates. Importantly, untreated OSA also contributes to higher suicide attempts&#xD;
      and completion. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the gold standard treatment for OSA with&#xD;
      large effects on multiple domains of functioning, quality of life, PTSD symptoms, physical&#xD;
      functioning, lower depression, and better emotional coping. Unfortunately, screening and&#xD;
      treating Veterans for OSA is not a part of clinical practice for SUD or PTSD treatment; as&#xD;
      such the average wait time for individuals to get PAP therapy is upward of two years. Despite&#xD;
      the widespread dissemination of knowledge regarding the detrimental effects of untreated OSA&#xD;
      and the incredible effectiveness of PAP treatment, OSA is rarely screened for or treated in&#xD;
      patients with SUD or PTSD, with approximately 80% to 90% of Veterans with OSA remaining&#xD;
      undiagnosed and untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to examine the effects of PAP treatment on Veterans with PTSD and SUD&#xD;
      on a 28-day residential unit. The investigators are proposing a randomized controlled study&#xD;
      comparing two groups: an early intervention PAP treatment group receiving PAP treatment while&#xD;
      on the residential unit, compared to a waitlist control group who will receive PAP treatment&#xD;
      at 3-months post-discharge follow-up. Participants will be 194 male and female Veterans on&#xD;
      the residential SUD and PTSD unit with SUD, PTSD, and OSA. The primary aim is to determine&#xD;
      the relative efficacy of PAP treatment on the SUD/PTSD unit, as compared to waitlist control,&#xD;
      in reducing problematic substance use, PTSD symptoms, and suicidal ideation, while improving&#xD;
      functioning among Veterans with comorbid SUD/PTSD at 3-months post-treatment follow-up. The&#xD;
      investigators will also compare PAP adherence rates on PTSD/SUD/functioning outcomes within&#xD;
      the PAP treatment group (3-months). Finally, the investigators plan on comparing adherence&#xD;
      rates between the two treatment groups at the 6-months post-treatment follow-up assessment.&#xD;
