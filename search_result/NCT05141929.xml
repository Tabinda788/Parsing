      This randomized controlled study aimed to examine the effect of web-based education related&#xD;

      Objective: To examine the effect of web-based education related to Gestational Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus on women health management self-efficacy and maternal-fetal-neonatal results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled study. Patients: Thirty one pregnant women were included in the&#xD;
      intervention group and thirty four pregnant women in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: For 8 weeks, web-based education for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus was offered&#xD;
      to pregnant women who diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus for the first time. The&#xD;
      data were collected before web-based education, after web-based education and postpartum&#xD;
      between 4-12 weeks at three different times. Control group was offered routine clinical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: health management self efficacy (primary outcomes),&#xD;
      maternal-fetal-neonatal results (secondary outcome).&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Self Rated Abilities for Health Practices levels in pregnant women with GDM</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Self Rated Abilities for Health Practices levels up to postpartum 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Self Rated Abilities for Health Practices Scale: Self Rated Abilities for Health Practices Scale: The 5-point Likert scale was adapted for Turkish version by Aypar Akbağ and Aluş Tokat (Aypar Akbağ and Aluş Tokat, 2021). The scale consists of 4 sub-dimensions: &quot;Exercise&quot;,&quot; Responsible Health Practices&quot;, &quot;Psychological Well Being&quot; and &quot;Nutrition&quot;. (from 0 (not at all) to 4 (completely). The scale total-score ranged between 0 and 112, while subscale total-scores ranging from 0 to 28 points. The higher scores from the scale indicate higher self-efficacy levels for the health applications.</description>

    <measure>Rate of maternal-fetal-neonatal complications in pregnant women with GDM</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in rate of maternal, fetal and neonatal complications up to postpartum 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The chart was used to evaluate the maternal (ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, polyhydramnios, preterm labor, vaginal or urinary infection), fetal (macrosomia, Intrauterine Growth Retardation) and neonatal (neonatal hypoglycemia, polycythemia and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, duration of treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), hypothermia, dehydration) complications of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. Complications during pregnancy and postpartum period were followed up. Complication follow-up was done by contacting the intervention group via the website. In the control group, complication follow-up was obtained by phone calls.</description>
