  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracotomy and video-assisted thoracic surgery procedures are frequently performed in&#xD;
      thoracic surgery. It is widely accepted that thoracotomy causes severe acute pain. This&#xD;
      prolongs the discharge time of the patients, and increases the frequency of postoperative&#xD;
      pulmonary complications and postoperative morbidity. Postoperative acute pain may cause&#xD;
      chronic thoracotomy pain in the later period, and may adversely affect the quality of life of&#xD;
      the patients. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become the standard procedure in&#xD;
      minor and major lung surgeries. Postoperative pain is seen in patients undergoing VATS,&#xD;
      although it is not as severe as after thoracotomy. As in thoracotomy, this affects the&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary complications and the discharge time of the patients. Likewise, this&#xD;
      pain can cause chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it was aimed to analyze the symptoms of chronic pain in the 3rd and 6th months&#xD;
      postoperatively in patients who had undergone thoracic surgery.&#xD;
