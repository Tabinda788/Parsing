  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an acellular dermal matrix&#xD;
      membrane to increase the peri-implant soft tissue thickness and to reduce marginal bone loss&#xD;
      during non-submerged implant placement, as compared with the standard protocol for implant&#xD;
      placement. The test hypothesis is that placing an acellular dermal matrix membrane&#xD;
      simultaneous to implant placement in the posterior mandible, will increase the soft tissue&#xD;
      thickness and consequently reduce the marginal bone level changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a doubled-blind, parallel groups, randomized clinical trial with a&#xD;
      1-year follow-up&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a doubled-blind, parallel groups, randomized clinical trial with a&#xD;
      1-year follow-up. The randomization sequence will be created using a computer-generated list&#xD;
      by an independent researcher. Allocation concealment will be kept by means of opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes that will be open by one of the researchers during surgery, and revealed to the&#xD;
      operator immediately after implant insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standardized oral hygiene instructions consisting on the use of a&#xD;
      manual or power-driven toothbrush and specific interdental brushes. Then, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Group :Mucoperiosteal flaps will be raised and the conventional drilling sequence&#xD;
           for implants will be implemented (Camlog Conelog Screw-Line Promote Plus implants).&#xD;
           Implants will be placed 1 mm below the bone crest. The diameter of the implant will be&#xD;
           in the range of 3.8 and 4.3 mm. Consecutively, 4 to 6 mm height healing abutments and&#xD;
           the allogenic membrane (NovoMatrix®, BioHorizon) folded in two on top of the implant&#xD;
           (secured with the healing abutment), will be placed. Finally, flaps will be sutured with&#xD;
           6/0 polypropylene monofilament. Patients will be instructed to rinse with 15 ml of 0.12%&#xD;
           chlorhexidine (Perio-Aid tratamiento, Dentaid SL, Barcelona, Spain) 60 seconds twice per&#xD;
           day until suture removal, that will take place 14 days later. Anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
           will also be prescribed (Ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours upon patient´s needs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Group: All the procedures will be the same as in the Test Group, with the only&#xD;
           difference that no attempt to thicken the mucosa with the acellular dermal matrix will&#xD;
           be performed.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in marginal alveolar crest</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable of this trial is the change in the marginal alveolar crest after the surgical intervention, assessed by the radiographic change of interproximal bone levels. It will be assessed with periapical radiographs, immediately after surgery and at 6 months and 12 months after loading, by means of computer image analysis software (Image J, National Institute of Health [NIH], Bethesda, Maryland). The calibration of the periapical radiographs will be performed using the distance between two implant threads or the length of the implant.</description>

Absence or presence of plaque on each surface in the dentition will be recorded in dichotomous manner, with subsequent calculation of the full-mouth plaque score as percentage of the surfaces with plaque to the total number of surfaces assessed; similarly, full-mouth bleeding score will be calculated, assessing presence of bleeding upon gentle probing with standardized force of 0.25 Newtons (N).</description>

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>will be reported by assessing post-surgical morbidity and patient-reported experience measures (Tonetti et al., 2018); Patients will be instructed to use a post-operative diary for the first 14 days after the surgery to capture patient-reported experience measures.&#xD;
The diary will be designed to assess patient recovery in four main areas: post-surgery sequelae, pain and discomfort, oral function and interference with daily activities. Patient perception of pain and discomfort will be rated using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale. Patients will be asked to report the number of tablets and days taken as painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Apart from that, patient perception of the difficulty of surgical intervention, patient perception of pain during the procedure and patient preference for alternate therapy will be recorded at the end of the surgery, using the VAS scale.</description>
