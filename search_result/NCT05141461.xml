  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rebound pain after nerve block could interfere with patient's recovery and&#xD;
      rehabilitation. It is not known how intravenous dexamethasone affects rebound pain. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the effect of intravenous dexamethasone on rebound pain after&#xD;
      interscalene block for shoulder surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty are associated with severe postoperative pain.&#xD;
      The interscalene block (ISB) is commonly used for this type of surgery, providing analgesia&#xD;
      by anesthetizing the nerves that supply the shoulder. Although the nerve block provides&#xD;
      extremely effective analgesia for the first 6-8 hours, patients experience severe pain once&#xD;
      its effect has been wearing off. Rebound pain is a severe pain that occurs when the effect of&#xD;
      a nerve block disappears in a patient during the postoperative period. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate whether the use of intravenous dexamethasone reduces rebound pain in&#xD;
      patients recruiting for shoulder surgery with interscalene brachial plexus blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded&#xD;
      trial in a university hospital. Patients scheduled for elective shoulder surgery will be&#xD;
      screened for enrollment in the study. All subjects will undergo ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      interscalene nerve block before induction of general anesthesia. They will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into the two groups which use intravenous dexamethasone or not. An anesthesiologist&#xD;
      who will perform blocks will not involve in the data collection. Other health care workers&#xD;
      who will involve in the evaluation of postoperative pain scores, nausea and vomiting, opioid&#xD;
      consumption, quality of Sleep, and Quality of Recovery score will be blinded to the group&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive 2 mg midazolam and 50 ug fentanyl for sedation before the block procedure. Each patient will be positioned appropriately, then a high frequency linear array transducer (13-6 MHz) will be placed in the interscalene region to define the brachial plexus on the short axis. Under sterile conditions, a 50 mm block needle will be advanced into the interscalen area using the in-plane method. After localization and negative aspiration, 15 ML of 5% bupivacaine drug will be injected into the interscalene area. 100 ml of NACI will be given intravenously within 15 minutes.&#xD;
General anesthesia will be performed using 2 mg/kg of propofol and 1-2 µg/kg of fentanyl. Tracheal intubation will be facilitated with 0.6mg/kg rocuronium. Anesthesia will be maintained using 50% oxygen and 2% sevoflurane. Patients will be extubated into the operating room after reversing residual muscle relaxation. A multimodal analgesia regimen will be applied postoperatively.</description>
