  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin condition worldwide and in&#xD;
      Singapore. There is a significant impact on the quality of life as well as psychosocial&#xD;
      burden on the patient and family. Emollients are one of the cornerstones in the treatment of&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis and are frequently prescribed with topical anti-inflammatories such as&#xD;
      topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors to be used during active flares.&#xD;
      Emollients that have additional anti-inflammatory properties may be able to reduce usage of&#xD;
      topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. In this study the investigators hope to&#xD;
      evaluate the use of a patented ceramide dominant emollient which sustainably lowers the skin&#xD;
      pH (Ceradan ® Advanced Cream, Hyphens Pharma, Singapore) with a commonly prescribed emollient&#xD;
      in Singapore (Basic Aqua Cream, ICM Pharma, Singapore) for the treatment of moderate atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis in children and adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, controlled study comparing a patented&#xD;
      ceramide dominant emollient which sustainably lowers the skin pH with a standard commercial&#xD;
      emollient for the treatment of moderate atopic dermatitis over two weeks. Subjects will be&#xD;
      concomitantly treated with a low-potency topical steroid (Desonide lotion, Galderma, France)&#xD;
      at the start of the trial to minimize any underlying skin inflammation for a more comparable&#xD;
      baseline skin state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators and subjects are blinded to the treatment allocation. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized using a random number sequence in a 1:1 ratio between the two arms. The study&#xD;
      administrator will keep this information concealed in an opaque, sealed envelope to be&#xD;
      disclosed upon completion of the trial. Allocation is secure and concealed with no further&#xD;
      changes to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be dispensed a mild potency topical steroid (Desonide lotion, Galderma, France)&#xD;
      and 480g of emollient (Ceradan ® Advanced Cream, Hyphens Pharma, Singapore or Basic Cream,&#xD;
      ICM Pharma, Singapore) for the duration of the trial. The amount of steroid dispense would&#xD;
      depend on the weight of the subject (&lt;20kg: 1 bottle, 20-40kg: 2 bottles, &gt;40kg: 3 bottles).&#xD;
      Emollients will be dispensed in identical, unmarked containers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should not wash the test areas with water or cleansing products (e.g. soap, body&#xD;
      cleansers, and bath and shower products) within the 12 hours prior to scheduled visit at 2&#xD;
      weeks (visit 1) for assessment. Subjects will be instructed to use mild potency topical&#xD;
      steroid (Desonide lotion, Galderma, France), twice a day to all affected areas with eczema&#xD;
      for the first three days of the trial. The topical steroid supplied can be used after the&#xD;
      initial period of treatment as needed and subjects will be asked to record down the areas&#xD;
      that treated and the duration of treatment. Subjects will be asked to use the emollient&#xD;
      provided twice a day on the face, trunk, and limbs. This is to be used after application of&#xD;
      topical steroids, where applicable. Subjects will be asked to not apply any other topical&#xD;
      leave-on products (e.g. creams, lotions, ointments) on the test areas, apart from those&#xD;
      products dispensed for this trial during the entire duration of the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to apply the emollient on the test areas the last time within 3-12 hours before the&#xD;
      scheduled final visit (visit 1). Dispensed product will be weighed and recorded prior to the&#xD;
      start of the trial and on completion of the trial to assess the compliance and amount of&#xD;
      product used.&#xD;
