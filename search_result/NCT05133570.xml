  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic wounds is around 2 million people in France per year. A chronic&#xD;
      wound is a wound that has been evolving for more than 6 weeks. The main causes are: venous&#xD;
      causes, arterial causes and microcirculatory causes. In some aetiologies (particularly&#xD;
      arterial causes), there is no radical therapeutic solution (no possibility of&#xD;
      revascularisation) and the wounds are often difficult to treat and may even eventually lead&#xD;
      to amputation. The recommendations for treating wounds are (in addition to carrying out an&#xD;
      etiological treatment when possible) to carry out mechanical detersion and to maintain a&#xD;
      moist wound environment. In addition to various medical devices such as dressings, adjuvant&#xD;
      treatments that are not specific to the etiology of the wound, such as electrotherapy,&#xD;
      negative pressure therapy or other devices such as the VistaCare®, are indicated in France.&#xD;
