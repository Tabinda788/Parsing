      Phase II, multicohort, single arm, open-label, multicenter, international clinical trial with&#xD;
      three cohorts (cohort A: Soft tissue sarcoma, cohort B: Bone tumors (osteosarcoma,&#xD;
      chondrosarcoma and cohort C: Small round-cell sarcomas (Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,&#xD;
      desmoplastic small round-cell tumors and other small round cell sarcomas)) with 7 sites in&#xD;
      Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) in the irradiated nodules&#xD;
      according to RECIST v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trabectedin at 1.5 mg/m2 24-h IV CI along with radiation therapy (30 Gy, 3 Gy/day for 10 days&#xD;
      for non-extremity location and 45 Gy, 1.8 Gy/day for 25 days for extremity location of target&#xD;
      lesion(s)), starting within 1 hour after the first trabectedin infusion withdrawal (day 2))&#xD;
      will be given every 3 weeks up to progression or intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 mg oral dexamethasone 24h and 12h before trabectedin administration, 20 mg IV dexamethasone&#xD;
      30 minutes before treatment. Ondansetron or analogue will also be given prior to trabectedin.&#xD;

      Cohort A: Soft tissue sarcomas (2nd or further line): A proportion of 10% of ORR will be&#xD;
      considered as not promising, whereas an ORR of 35% will be considered promising in this&#xD;
      population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 27 patients were estimated in&#xD;
      this cohort. With Simon's two-stage optimal design,36 at least 2 responses have to be&#xD;
      obtained over the 11 first patients. Then, additional 16 eligible patients will be accrued up&#xD;
      to 27 patients. If at least 6 patients show response, further investigation of this scheme is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Bone tumors (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma) (2nd or further line): A proportion of&#xD;
      3% of ORR will be considered as not promising, whereas an ORR of 20% will be considered&#xD;
      promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 29 patients&#xD;
      were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage optimal design,36 at least 1 response&#xD;
      has to be obtained over the 12 first patients. Then, additional 17 eligible patients will be&#xD;
      accrued up to 29 patients. If at least 3 patients show response, further investigation of&#xD;
      this scheme is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C: Small round-cell sarcomas (Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small&#xD;
      round-cell tumors and other small round-cell sarcomas) (3rd or further line): A proportion of&#xD;
      15% of ORR will be considered as not promising, whereas an ORR of 40% will be considered&#xD;
      promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 29 patients&#xD;
      were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage optimal design,36 at least 3 response&#xD;
      has to be obtained over the 13 first patients. Then, additional 16 eligible patients will be&#xD;
      accrued up to 29 patients. If at least 8 patients show response, further investigation of&#xD;
      this scheme is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account that 10% of enrolled patients might not be evaluable (losses), an extra&#xD;
      amount of 3 patients may be recruited per cohort.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific&#xD;
             procedures and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up. Informed&#xD;
             consent must be obtained prior to start of the screening process. Procedures conducted&#xD;
             as part of the patient's routine clinical management (e.g. blood count, imaging tests,&#xD;
             etc.) and obtained prior to signature of informed consent may be used for screening or&#xD;
             baseline purposes as long as these procedures are conducted as specified in the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age: 16-75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma (cohort A), bone tumors&#xD;
             (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma) (cohort B) or small round-cell sarcomas (Ewing's&#xD;
             sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round-cell tumors and other small round&#xD;
             cell sarcomas) (cohort C), with metastasis or locally advanced disease, and not&#xD;
             suitable for metastasectomy or surgical resection or not oncologically recommended&#xD;
             metastasectomy. A centralized diagnosis will be performed, and the central diagnosis&#xD;
             confirmation will be mandatory prior to enrollment (tumor sample must be available and&#xD;
             sent during screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Disease distribution allows meeting with normal tissue constraints of radiation&#xD;
             therapy. Radiation oncologist must confirm this point, taking into account that the&#xD;
             dose for extremities will be 45 Gy while for non-extremity will be 30 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Those lesions considered for radiation therapy must be related with a clinically&#xD;
             relevant symptom. It is not necessary to irradiate all the lesions within one organ.&#xD;
             Irradiating pulmonary lesions with infiltration of pleural serosa should be&#xD;
             discouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have documentation of disease progression within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient must have been considered eligible for systemic chemotherapy. Patients&#xD;
             should had received at least one line of systemic therapy (anthracycline-based in the&#xD;
             case of Cohort A-STS, unless the patient is not candidate for treatment with&#xD;
             anthracyclines), with a maximum of three previous lines for advanced/metastatic&#xD;
             disease are allowed as long as trabectedin has not been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The following sarcoma types are eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone tumors (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Small round-cell sarcomas (Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small&#xD;
                  round-cell tumors and other small round cell sarcomas)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Measurable disease, according to RECIST v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Performance status ≤ 1 (ECOG).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate respiratory functions: FEV1 &gt; 1L; DLCO &gt; 40% (patients with pulmonary target&#xD;
             lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mm3, absolute&#xD;
             neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3). Patients with creatinine&#xD;
             clearance (based on Cockroft and Gault) ≥30 ml/min, albumin ≥ 25 g/L, ALT and AST ≤&#xD;
             2.5 times the ULN, total bilirubin ≤ ULN, CPK ≤ 2.5 times ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤&#xD;
             2.5 times the ULN are acceptable. If the increase of alkaline phosphatase is &gt; 2.5&#xD;
             times the ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase liver fraction and/or GGT must be ≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Men or women of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception&#xD;
             before entry into the study and throughout the trial treatment and for 6 months after&#xD;
             the last dose of trabectedin. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Normal cardiac function with a LVEF ≥ 50% by echocardiogram or MUGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. HBV and HCV serologies must be performed prior to enrollment. If HbsAg is positive it&#xD;
             is recommended to reject the existence of replicative phase (HbaAg+, DNA VHB+). If&#xD;
             these were positives the inclusion is not recommended, remaining at investigators'&#xD;
             discretion the preventive treatment with lamivudine. If a potential patient is&#xD;
             positive for anti-HCV antibodies, presence of the virus should be ruled out with a&#xD;
             qualitative PCR, or the patient should NOT be included in the study (if a qualitative&#xD;
             PCR cannot be performed then patient will not be able to enter the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient must have a central venous catheter for treatment, required for trabectedin&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous treatment with trabectedin or previous treatment with radiotherapy (this&#xD;
             latter just in case the previous radiotherapy treatment does not allow the&#xD;
             radiotherapy treatment of this study due to tissue constrains).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Liver inclusion in irradiation fields is not permitted, not even partially.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Normal tissue constrains for radiation therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. History of other neoplastic disease with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or in&#xD;
             situ cervical cancer adequately treated or no evidence of recurrence for more than 5&#xD;
             years after primary tumor treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other severe pulmonary&#xD;
             diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Significant cardiovascular disease (for example, dyspnea &gt; 2 NYHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Significant systemic diseases grade 3 or higher on the NCI-CTCAE v5.0 scale, that&#xD;
             limit patient availability, or according to investigator judgment may contribute&#xD;
             significantly to treatment toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Uncontrolled bacterial, mycotic or viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
