    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomised, stratified, multicentre phase 2 clinical trial recruiting&#xD;

Overall scores can be from a minimum of 28 indicating a better quality of life and higher scores with a maximum of 112 indicating lower overall quality of life. The questionnaire also has two summary questions which asks participants to rank 1) overall health and 2) overall quality of life on scale of from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent).</description>
