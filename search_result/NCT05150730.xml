  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation for work-related musculoskeletal disorders involves physical, behavioral,&#xD;
      psychological treatment and counseling on how to deal with pain and disability. The study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the profile and indicators on the perception of health, pain intensity, and&#xD;
      work ability (WA) of disability with work-related chronic musculoskeletal disease, assisted&#xD;
      in a multidisciplinary program of worker health care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is an intervention pre and post, 88 individuals diagnosed with work-related&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders were followed up during a multidisciplinary program at the&#xD;
      Reference Center for Workers' Health of the Unified Health System (SUS), SP, Brazil. The&#xD;
      study was carried out six groups of individuals were followed (16 to 21 meetings; 10 to 19&#xD;
      participants). Sociodemographic, occupational, general health, pain intensity, and work&#xD;
      ability (WA) were assessed at the baseline. Participants included has work-related&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders diagnosis and complaints of chronic pain in one or more regions of&#xD;
      the body, of different age groups, education levels, income, and occupational status&#xD;
      (unemployed, leave work, or is working). Chronic pain is defined as a persistent or recurrent&#xD;
      symptom lasting longer than three months. Criteria whose main diagnosis was a work-related&#xD;
      mental disorder or musculoskeletal complaints related to previous injuries resulting from an&#xD;
      accident or typical displacement from work, such as amputations and fractures, were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain complains - Body region The diagnoses of musculoskeletal diseases were grouped by&#xD;
           body segments: cervical spine, lumbar spine, upper limbs and lower limbs. Pain&#xD;
           complaints reported by individuals were also grouped by segments: cervical, lumbar, more&#xD;
           than one spinal segment, upper limbs, lower limbs, two areas of the body, three or more&#xD;
           body region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain intensity To measure pain intensity, the Numerical Rating Scale was used, an&#xD;
           instrument that presents itself as a numbered line from zero (no pain) to ten points&#xD;
           (maximum pain). Individuals responded about pain in the last seven days and in the last&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Work ability - using two questions (current and future work ability). Based on the Work&#xD;
           Ability Index (WA) have been inserted into this script questions about health&#xD;
           perception, current and future WA (two years from now).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Emotional State&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Job Satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two questions were also added to assess emotional state and job satisfaction. A Likert&#xD;
           scale from 0 to 10 was used to answer all questions, and for the perception of health,&#xD;
           current WA, future WA, and emotional state, the extremes represented respectively &quot;very&#xD;
           bad&quot; and &quot;great&quot;, and for satisfaction, 0 meant &quot;totally dissatisfied&quot; and 10 &quot;totally&#xD;
           satisfied&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Work demand The work demand was also evaluated based on the individual's perception of&#xD;
           their work, in which they could refer to a greater physical or mental demand or the&#xD;
           perception that their work involved both physical and mental demand, without any&#xD;
           predominance.&#xD;

    <description>Participants were instructed to respect their pain threshold during body practice and the evolution of the participants happened gradually and individually. Associated with the practice of exercise, workers received information about their disease, chronic pain, guidelines for daily activities, and the importance of physical exercise. In the second hour, the responsible psychologist addressed issues such as the repercussions of illnesses on the individual's social and affective life, self-esteem, self-image, conformism, and self-indulgence after the illness and prospects for the future. Throughout the program, participants also received informative lectures from other professionals, such as social workers, nurses, and dentists.</description>
