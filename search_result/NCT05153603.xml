  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four phase III trials in ovarian cancer consistently showed that front-line poly(ADP-ribose)&#xD;
      polymerase (PARP) inhibition can significantly improve progression-free survival. Based on&#xD;
      these findings, current clinical guidelines recommend the olaparib + bevacizumab combination&#xD;
      as a maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1/2 wild-type or unknown&#xD;
      mutation status who have a complete response (CR)/ partial response (PR) after completing&#xD;
      bevacizumab-containing first-line therapy. However, bevacizumab is not a NATIONAL MEDICAL&#xD;
      PRODUCTS ADMINSTRATION（NMPA）-approved agent for ovarian cancer patients. In this setting,&#xD;
      olaparib mono-maintenance therapy has been implemented among patients with BRCA-wild type&#xD;
      tumors in clinical practice in China.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the outcome of olaparib-based maintenance therapy by&#xD;
      proportion of patients alive and progression free at 1 year (1-yr PFS rate) We hypothesize&#xD;
      that olaparib monotherapy could be beneficial for tBRCAwt high-grade serous ovarian cancer&#xD;
      (HGSOC) patients who are treated with platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the outcomes of olaparib-based maintenance therapy&#xD;
      by: 1) 2-yr PFS rate; 2) median PFS; 3) median Time to First Subsequent Therapy or death&#xD;
      (mTFST) ; 4) post-progression treatment after first progression; 5) reason for olaparib dose&#xD;
      adjustment, dose interruptions, and dose discontinuations; 6) Reason for use of concomitant&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective is to evaluate the status quo of genetic testing, R0 resection and&#xD;
      related outcomes.&#xD;
