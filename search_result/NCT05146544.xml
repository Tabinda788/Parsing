  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to better characterize an adapted physical activity (APA) program within of&#xD;
      the management of chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, since 2016, medical doctors have been able to prescribe APA to their patients with&#xD;
      chronic diseases but while there are indeed prescription recommendations, there is no clear&#xD;
      characterization of the practical reality of APA programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of this work is to benefit from the experience of the Center of Sports Medicine&#xD;
      and Adapted Physical Activities in Nancy (France) specifically dedicated to the prescription&#xD;
      and the initiation of an APA program for of patients with a chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this work aims to determine the real intensity of the APA, the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      assessment necessary for the dispensation of the APA and other parameters likely to modify&#xD;
      the result of the treatment.&#xD;
