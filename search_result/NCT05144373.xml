    <textblock>
      Infants with Down syndrome show significant delays and weaknesses in motor, cognitive, and&#xD;
      language development compared to typically developing infants. This project aims to examine&#xD;
      the developmental cascade effects of specific gross and fine motor experience on motor,&#xD;
      cognitive and language development in infants with Down syndrome. We propose that both gross&#xD;
      and fine motor experience will facilitate cognitive and language development in infants with&#xD;
      Down syndrome, and particularly, fine motor experience will help advance gesture and early&#xD;
      words production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic condition and causes significant development&#xD;
      delays and weaknesses in the motor, cognitive, and language domains. It is important to study&#xD;
      these co-occurring developmental challenges and develop effective intervention strategies for&#xD;
      positive learning outcomes in multiple domains simultaneously. It was found that motor&#xD;
      development is closely associated with cognitive and language development in typically&#xD;
      developing infants and advances in motor development have developmental cascade effects on&#xD;
      other domains. However, this interrelation has not been studied in infants with DS. Our prior&#xD;
      work has shown that gross motor experience through body-weight-supported treadmill stepping&#xD;
      leads to an earlier onset of walking and improves subsequent locomotor ability in infants&#xD;
      with DS. However, we do not yet know the extent to which this motor experience advances&#xD;
      cognitive and language development in infants with DS. Research also suggests that grasping,&#xD;
      a major fine motor skill emerging in infancy, provides the needed scaffolding for subsequent&#xD;
      gesture and speech production. However, research on grasping and its potential effects on&#xD;
      other domains in infants with DS remains scarce. The objectives of this proposal are to&#xD;
      understand: the role of (a) specific gross motor experience and (b) specific fine motor&#xD;
      experience on the motor, cognitive and language development of infants with DS. Our central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that motor (both gross and fine) experience will help advance cognitive and&#xD;
      language development in infants with DS. We will recruit 45 infants with DS from the greater&#xD;
      Atlanta area and beyond. There will be three groups: (a) gross motor (GM) group (n=15),&#xD;
      entering the study at about 10 months of age; (b) gross motor plus fine motor (GM+FM) group&#xD;
      (n=15), entering the study at about 10 months; and (c) control group (n=15), entering the&#xD;
      study at about 20 months. Aim 1: Determine the effects of gross motor experience on cognitive&#xD;
      and language development in infants with DS, comparing the GM and control groups. Only the GM&#xD;
      group will receive a home-based, parent-guided practice of treadmill stepping from 10 months&#xD;
      of age (T1) until onset of walking. We hypothesize that the GM group will show higher Bayley&#xD;
      scores and better gesture and word production at termination of the GM intervention (T3) and&#xD;
      five months thereafter (T4) than the control group. Aim 2: Determine the effects of fine&#xD;
      motor experience on cognitive and language development in infants with DS who receive the GM&#xD;
      intervention, particularly in gesture and word production, comparing the GM and GM+FM groups.&#xD;
      Only the GM+FM group will receive fine motor experience in practice of grasping using &quot;sticky&#xD;
      mittens&quot; from 10 months of age for about five months. We hypothesize that the GM+FM group&#xD;
      will show further improvements in motor, cognitive and language domains, particularly in&#xD;
      gesture and word production, than the GM group at termination of the FM intervention (T2) and&#xD;
      again at T3 and T4. Our study will gain an in-depth understanding of the cascading effects of&#xD;
      motor experience on cognitive and language development and lay the groundwork for future&#xD;
      clinical trials in infants with DS.&#xD;
