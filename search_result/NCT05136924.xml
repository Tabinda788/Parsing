    <description>OC-01 nasal spray containing varenicline for treatment of signs and symptoms of DED. OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray activates the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway and stimulates natural tear production to bathe the corneal nerve endings in a protective layer of tear film. In addition, OC-01 (varenicline) acts as a cholinergic agonist and may provide analgesia by activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway VS Placebo</description>
