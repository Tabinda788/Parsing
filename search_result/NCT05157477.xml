  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish a cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) based virtual exposure (VR)&#xD;
      exposure program to train ASD adults coping with everyday sensory scenarios. Through the&#xD;
      practice and training, the ASD participants may learn the strategy to deal with the common&#xD;
      sensory scenarios and master the anxiety around the exposure. The anticipatory anxiety and&#xD;
      the maladaptive behaviors may be decreased along with the process of desensitization, while&#xD;
      the functional impairment related to sensory sensitivity can partly be recovered.&#xD;

    <description>The participants who are randomized into 'CBT-based VR exposure program' (CBT+VR group) will receive the individual intervention weekly with a total of 8 sessions. The therapists, PI (Chien YL) and a clinical psychologist who is familiar with ASD psychopathology and CBT approach, will provide the CBT-based VR exposure intervention for each individual every week based on the above protocol. The participants complete the homework (i.e., relaxation and real-life exposure) between the sessions, and record 'anxiety level' before, during, and after the real-life exposure. The outcome measures will be scheduled at the end of intervention (8th week) within one week of program closure.</description>

    <description>The participants who are randomized into control group will be regularly followed in a naturalistic outpatient clinic setting (every 2-4 week). During the clinic, sensory and socioemotional problems will be discussed face-to-face for 10 to 20 minutes, some self-help books will be recommended.</description>

    <intervention_name>CBT-based VR exporsure program</intervention_name>
    <description>This project seeks to establish a 8-week CBT-based VR exposure program to tackle sensory problems in ASD according to the theory of exposure and desensitization (both social and non-social scenarios) as well as identifying dysfunctional thought and searching for alternative thinking. In brief, this program aims to build up the core competence of the ASD individuals in facing the sensory environment, including (1) Relaxation skills (2) Ranking the fearful sensory situations (3) Anxiety coping strategy (3) Graded exposure (4) Cognitive appraisal and restructuring: identifying the dysfunctional thought when facing the social situations and figuring out alternative thinking.</description>
