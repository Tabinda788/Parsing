    <textblock>
      In order to define distinct and reliable arterial 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) thresholds&#xD;
      identifying patients at risk for cardiovascular events, patients with a history of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction will be included in this international multicenter trial. Non-enhanced whole-body&#xD;
      FDG PET/CT will be performed in all patients and the arterial FDG uptake in the carotid&#xD;
      arteries as well as the aorta will be quantified by calculating different uptake parameters.&#xD;
      In addition, FDG uptake in hematopoietic tissues (spleen, bone marrow), visceral adipose&#xD;
      tissue (VAT) and different brain regions (e. g. amygdala) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, specific blood biomarkers including genetic biomarkers, which are linked to&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease with predictive power for future cardiovascular events, will be&#xD;
      analyzed in a subgroup of patients. In part 2 of the trial, a 4-year follow-up period will be&#xD;
      analyzed with a focus on the prediction of cardiovascular events (acute coronary syndrome,&#xD;
      non-fatal ischemic stroke, ischemic cardiac death, other causes of death, coronary/vascular&#xD;
      revascularization, new-onset of angina, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease and heart&#xD;
      failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive value of the arterial, hematopoietic and cerebral FDG uptake parameters as&#xD;
      well as of the specific blood and genetic biomarkers will be determined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From a clinical perspective, atherosclerosis leading to arterial plaque rupture is one of the&#xD;
      most important causes of death that still misses a personalized, reliable and quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of risk. This is particularly true for patients who suffered from a non-fatal&#xD;
      coronary syndrome, were recent studies described severe CVD event rates of up to 5 % per year&#xD;
      despite the use of aggressive secondary prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in previous clinical interventional trials inflammatory atherosclerotic activity was&#xD;
      mainly determined by the surrogate marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, other studies&#xD;
      have shown superiority of FDG PET/CT in the stratification of patients in high versus low&#xD;
      risk groups, where risk in the highest (vs. lowest) TBR tertile was approximately 3-fold&#xD;
      greater compared with what has been historically observed for the inflammatory blood&#xD;
      biomarker, hsCRP. It is, thus, expected that imaging (vs. blood) biomarkers provide&#xD;
      additional prognostic information that is more relevant to the artery wall per se, whereas&#xD;
      currently used blood biomarkers carry information from vascular as well as nonvascular&#xD;
      sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research aims at identifying distinct and reliable FDG PET threshold values,&#xD;
      which specify the individual risk of a distinct patient. For this purpose, a well-designed&#xD;
      and well-powered multicenter trial is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundamentally, the research project aims at evaluating the prognostic value of arterial FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging of individuals with known cardiovascular disease (CVD). Specifically, we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the hypothesis that the baseline measures of arterial inflammation (as assessed by&#xD;
           FDG PET/CT) independently predict the risk of CVD events (as coronary death, myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, coronary insufficiency, angina, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke,&#xD;
           transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, revascularization, or heart&#xD;
           failure) in a large cohort of individuals with prior MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the incremental prognostic value of arterial inflammation (PET) over&#xD;
           circulating blood biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the prognostic value of inflammation data derived from various arterial&#xD;
           locations (e.g. aorta, carotids, or other locations) for their ability to predict severe&#xD;
           cardiovascular events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify cut-off values that indicate higher risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the predicted value of specific brain uptake, hematopoietic tissue (spleen,&#xD;
           bone marrow) and visceral adipose tissue on emerging CV events. Evaluate the added value&#xD;
           of combining those uptake values with arterial uptake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the different established arterial FDG uptake parameters with regards to&#xD;
           standardization and scanner type/variability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apply deep-learning algorithms for detection of organ/tissue interactions and CV event&#xD;
           hypothesis generation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate a subset of patients for inter-observer variability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the detection rate of incidental PET/CT findings in the study cohort (suspected&#xD;
           malignancies, other diseases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suggest novel diagnostic algorithms and clinical protocols accordingly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the prognostic value of additionally derived genetic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specifically, we propose that patients with higher GRS have increased FDG PET/CT based&#xD;
           inflammatory atherosclerotic activity and are prone to more MACE&#xD;
