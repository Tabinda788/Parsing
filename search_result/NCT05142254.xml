    <textblock>
      To conduct a randomized controlled internal pilot feasibility trial for the prevention of&#xD;
      recurrent ischemic priapism referred to as the Priapism in Nigeria (PIN) trial. The study&#xD;
      team will enroll a minimum of 30 participants and a maximum of 200 participants. Study&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that hydroxyurea therapy combined with tadalafil is superior to a&#xD;
      combination of hydroxyurea and placebo in the prevention of recurrent ischemic priapism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest genetic diseases in the world.&#xD;
      Approximately 300,000 newborns are born with SCD every year, with 50% of the birth being in&#xD;
      Nigeria alone.(1) This huge burden makes Nigeria critical to any intervention that seeks to&#xD;
      address the challenges of individuals with SCD. Men with SCD experience many complications,&#xD;
      which can even affect their sexuality and reproductive health.(13) One of the most common,&#xD;
      but often neglected complications of SCD in men is priapism. Priapism is defined as a&#xD;
      painful, purposeless, and sustained erection.(3,8) In men with SCD, priapism tends to be&#xD;
      recurrent and devastating.(14) The prevalence of priapism was 42% in Jamaican men with&#xD;
      SCD.(15) Serjeant et al. reported the incidence of priapism in SCD to be very low before the&#xD;
      age of 10 years, but the cumulative incidence rose to 32.7% by the age of 20 years.(16)&#xD;
      Adeyoju et al. reported the prevalence of priapism in SCD to be 35%, out of which 72% was&#xD;
      recurrent ischemic priapism (lasting &lt;4 hours).(14) The majority of the individuals with SCD&#xD;
      experienced their first episode of priapism before the age of 20 years, with a mean age of&#xD;
      onset being 15 years.(14) In a cross-sectional study of 353 men with SCD, conducted by our&#xD;
      team in Kano, Nigeria, the prevalence of priapism was approximately 32%; out of which 74% was&#xD;
      recurrent ischemic priapism (unpublished). In the same study, the prevalence of priapism in&#xD;
      men without SCD (n=250) was 2%. The results from focus groups (3 in Nigeria and 3 in the&#xD;
      U.S.) our team conducted revealed men with SCD who experienced recurrent ischemic priapism&#xD;
      struggled with embarrassment, shame, anxiety and depression, and declining sexual function&#xD;
      (unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevention and treatment of ischemic priapism in SCD is still inadequate. Virag et al.&#xD;
      used a combination of preventive oral etilefrine and self-administered intracavernosal&#xD;
      injection of etilefrine for breakthrough priapism lasting &gt;1 hour. Sixty-six percent (4 of 6)&#xD;
      had no recurrence of priapism while the remaining two used intracavernosal injection of&#xD;
      etilefrine.(20) In a non-RCT study, Okpala et al. reported a good response to oral&#xD;
      etilefrine; which was shown to have reduced the frequency of recurrent ischemic priapism in&#xD;
      SCD (mean difference 5.78); P &lt; 0.0001.(21) However, in the only RCT for this drug,&#xD;
      etilefrine was found to have no efficacy over placebo.(22) Daibes et al. showed that in 35&#xD;
      patients on graded doses of finasteride (5-alpha reductase inhibitor), priapism recurrences&#xD;
      were reduced from an average of 22.7 to 2.1 at the end of the 120-day follow-up.(23) A&#xD;
      combination of oral ketoconazole with prednisolone showed a promising result in case-series&#xD;
      reported by Abern et al.(24) However, an RCT (n=40) showed no efficacy of ketoconazole&#xD;
      (81.25% and 83% in both arms still having post-operative painful erections).(25) In another&#xD;
      study by Saad et al., hydroxyurea was shown to have decreased priapism recurrences in 4 of 5&#xD;
      men treated with a high dose.(26) Nonetheless, stopping hydroxyurea heralded relapse of&#xD;
      priapism. Burnett et al. reported that sildenafil has controlled priapism experiences in 6 of&#xD;
      7 men observed.(27) Non-RCT designs, small sample sizes, or adverse effects of the trial&#xD;
      medications limit most of these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This conceptual framework is based on the synergistic effect of tadalafil (PDE-5 inhibitor,&#xD;
      which increases the bioavailability of cGMP),(7), and hydroxyurea (NO donor).(9) In SCD there&#xD;
      is chronic hemolysis causing depletion of NO and dysregulation of PDE-5, which underpin the&#xD;
      molecular basis of priapism. Chronic dosing of low-dose tadalafil inhibits PDE-5 to&#xD;
      paradoxically restore the normal homeostatic mechanism of the NO-cGMP-PDE-5 pathway. Restored&#xD;
      PDE-5 function helps prevent recurrent ischemic priapism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the need, all prior priapism studies did not provide sufficient evidence for&#xD;
      practice-based outcomes. Several reasons exist for the lack of any substantial progress for&#xD;
      secondary prevention of ischemic priapism, the foremost of which is that SCD is a rare&#xD;
      disease in high-income settings where most of the studies have been conducted. To overcome&#xD;
      these limitations, the investigators propose an internal pilot trial to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility trial in a setting where there are over 5000 men available to be enrolled in one&#xD;
      city, Kano Nigeria. The trial will also build on the infrastructures and workflow established&#xD;
      by NIH-funded pre-existing SCD stroke prevention trials conducted at the same hospitals in&#xD;
      Kano.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are 1) To conduct a randomized internal pilot trial and possible complete a phase&#xD;
      III trial for the prevention of recurrent ischemic priapism (hydroxyurea + tadalafil vs&#xD;
      hydroxyurea + placebo), referred to as the Priapism in Nigeria (PIN) trial, and 2) To assess&#xD;
      the tolerability of moderate-dose hydroxyurea and its effect on spermatogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained study personnel will approach the eligible participants for consenting. After&#xD;
      obtaining signed informed consent and ensuring they have fulfilled inclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 1:1 to the treatment and placebo arms. The primary study&#xD;
      statistician will be supported by a local statistician in Nigeria to perform the&#xD;
      randomization process. After the random allocation, all study personnel and participants will&#xD;
      be blinded to the treatment. The treatment arm will include tadalafil, given orally initially&#xD;
      at a low-dose of 2.5 mg daily for four weeks. If tolerated very well during the four weeks,&#xD;
      the dose will be increased to 5.0 mg daily as the final dose. Tadalafil and the identical&#xD;
      placebo will be purchased from a local pharmaceutical company, Bond Chemical Nigerian&#xD;
      Limited, which is licensed to produce tadalafil and hydroxyurea in Nigeria. Participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to take tadalafil or placebo in the morning for this trial. Chronic morning&#xD;
      dosing with tadalafil will allow the drug to be metabolized and is unlikely to be associated&#xD;
      with sleep-related erections. Both treatment and placebo arms will be on hydroxyurea as&#xD;
      standard care. Hydroxyurea will be given orally at a moderate-dose of 20mg/kg/day and is also&#xD;
      produced by the Bond Chemical Nigerian Limited. The moderate-dose of hydroxyurea is found to&#xD;
      be effective, with minimal adverse effects, in the preliminary data of stroke prevention in&#xD;
      Nigeria (1R01NS094041) trial just recently completed in Kano, Nigeria. Both arms of the trial&#xD;
      will be followed for one year; afterward, the trial will go into the open-label phase. The&#xD;
      participant can select whether they want to continue either therapy or start a new treatment.&#xD;
      At the baseline, demographic and clinical data from medical records of the participants will&#xD;
      be collected. The data will include but are not limited to: co-morbidities (hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, etc.), drug history (antihypertensives, aphrodisiacs, hormonal shots, alpha&#xD;
      receptor agonists, antipsychotics, etc.), pain history, and blood transfusions history. The&#xD;
      investigators will use internationally validated questionnaires (International Index of&#xD;
      Erectile Function [IIEF],(24) PROMIS Erectile function,(25) sexual activity, and satisfaction&#xD;
      with sex life) to evaluate erectile and sexual functions of the participants at baseline and&#xD;
      subsequent follow-ups.&#xD;
