  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of an&#xD;
      intervention that provides a behavioral weight gain prevention intervention in advance of&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatment in individuals with overweight or obesity who smoke cigarettes.&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine feasibility and acceptability and initial&#xD;
      efficacy regarding whether preceding 8 weeks of smoking cessation treatment with 8 weeks of&#xD;
      self-regulation strategies + large changes for weight gain prevention (SR), compared to 8&#xD;
      weeks of healthy lifestyle education (LE), will result in greater smoking cessation and&#xD;
      reduced weight gain. Secondary aims are to study effects on self-efficacy for managing weight&#xD;
      and for quitting smoking, negative affect, and delayed reward discounting. Methods:&#xD;
      Individuals with overweight or obesity who smoke cigarettes will participate in a 16-week&#xD;
      group-based multiple health behavior change intervention. Groups will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either 8 weeks of SR followed by 8 weeks of smoking cessation treatment or 8 weeks of&#xD;
      LE followed by 8 weeks of smoking cessation treatment. Smoking cessation treatment in both&#xD;
      conditions will include counseling and combination nicotine replacement therapy (patch +&#xD;
      lozenges), with a quit day at week 9 of the 16-week intervention. Assessments will occur at&#xD;
      baseline, on quit day and 1, 2, and 3 months later. Determining the viability of this&#xD;
      strategy in terms of effects on both smoking and weight has high significance to public&#xD;
      health.&#xD;

      Aims - The specific aims are to examine: (1) the feasibility, acceptability, and initial&#xD;
      efficacy of using self-regulation strategies for weight gain prevention (SR), relative to the&#xD;
      provision of healthy lifestyle education (LE), prior to smoking cessation treatment in a&#xD;
      pilot study; (2) compare the effect of self-regulation strategies for weight gain prevention&#xD;
      (SR), relative to the provision of healthy lifestyle education (LE), prior to smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment, on mechanisms thought to underlie smoking abstinence. Mechanisms include&#xD;
      self-efficacy for managing weight and for quitting smoking, negative affect, and delayed&#xD;
      reward discounting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology - A randomized trial will be used to test the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      initial efficacy of using self-regulation strategies for weight gain prevention prior to&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatment. Eligible participants will complete baseline assessment and be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions. Participants assigned to the SR condition will&#xD;
      receive 8 weeks of self-regulation strategies + large changes for weight gain prevention,&#xD;
      followed by 8 weeks of smoking cessation treatment. Participants assigned to the LE condition&#xD;
      will receive 8 weeks of healthy lifestyle education, followed by 8 weeks of smoking cessation&#xD;
      treatment. The intervention will be delivered using a group-based format and will last 16&#xD;
      weeks. Random assignment will occur at the group level. Participants will receive nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy and counseling as part of the smoking cessation intervention and will&#xD;
      quit smoking as a group halfway through treatment (week 9). Assessments will occur at&#xD;
      baseline, on quit day (week 9), 1 month after quit day (week 13), 2 months after quit day&#xD;
      (week 17), and 3 months after quit day (week 21). Approximately 30 participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to each condition (study N=60).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two study conditions at the group level after they have completed baseline assessment. The principal investigator, who is not involved in conducting assessments, will use a random number generator to determine assignment.

    <description>The first 8 weeks (weeks 1-8) of the 16-week program will include weekly group sessions focused on teaching self-regulation and efforts to produce a 10 lb weight loss to buffer against anticipated post-cessation weight gain. Participants will be taught the core self-regulation skills for controlling their weight. In order to produce an initial weight loss buffer, they will be instructed to self-monitor their intake, given a daily calorie goal, and taught strategies for reducing caloric intake. Structured physical activity, such as brisk walking will also be prescribed and self-monitored. During smoking cessation treatment (weeks 9-16), participants will be asked to continue to use self-regulation skills for monitoring their weight and to use a color zone system (red, yellow, green) to determine what course of action to follow based on whether changes in weight have occurred.</description>

    <description>The first 8 weeks (weeks 1-8) of the 16-week program will include weekly group sessions focused on living a healthy lifestyle. Information provided will include education on why weight gain happens while quitting smoking, principles of healthy eating (e.g., simple versus complex carbohydrates), physical activity guidelines, and other topics related to living a healthy lifestyle. Participants can choose to use the healthy lifestyle information and education provided however they would like. Participants will not be asked to use self-regulation strategies during either part of the 16-week program.</description>

    <description>The second 8 weeks (weeks 9-16) of the 16-week program will include weekly group counseling sessions focused on smoking cessation. The smoking cessation treatment provided will be the same in both arms of the study. In preparation of quitting, nicotine replacement therapy lozenges will be provided for 3 weeks prior to quitting (weeks 6-8). A group quit day will occur on week 9. During the smoking cessation portion of treatment (weeks 9-16), participants will be provided with combination nicotine replacement therapy (patches + lozenges) and daily supportive text messages.</description>
