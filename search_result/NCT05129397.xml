      This study is a randomized controlled confirmatory efficacy trial of virtual Mom Power (MP),&#xD;
      a group-based, relationship-focused multifamily intervention with previously demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness improving maternal mental health and parenting stress in randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials. vMP targets 5 core components: 1) enhancing social support; 2) attachment-based&#xD;
      parenting education; 3) self-care, including affect regulation; 4) guided parent-child&#xD;
      interactions, and 5) connecting to care. Eligible and enrolled participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive the 10 week group-based intervention or 10 weeks of informational&#xD;
      mailings; both groups will receive individual home-based sessions. Outcomes include maternal&#xD;
      social support, psychopathology, sensitive parenting, child psychopathology, two-generational&#xD;
      biobehavioral self-regulation targets (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia), parent and child&#xD;
      emotion and behavior regulation, and dyadic behavioral and physiological synchrony.&#xD;
      Assessments will occur at intake, post, and 6 months following the group.&#xD;

    <description>The experimental arm of Virtual Mom Power is a manualized multi-family group intervention consisting of 10, 90-minute virtual group + 2 individual sessions led by two co-facilitators. The curriculum includes 5 core components: (1) Attachment-Focused Parenting Education; (2) Self-Care; (3) Parenting Practice; (4) Social Support; &amp; (5) Connection to Resources. Individual sessions combine motivational interviewing with MP core components and focus on identifying goals and barriers. We will work with mothers in individual coaching to problem-solve childcare and privacy during group time. Weekly between-group phone/text check-ins are also a part of the curriculum, used to strengthen connection, build trust, ensure safety, and assess basic needs. Data regarding attendance will be recorded and total dosage examined in treatment effects.</description>

    <description>The control arm of this study consists of two individual sessions with mothers, along with 10 weeks of virtual informational mailings. The mailings will contain Mom Power curriculum about attachment-based parenting and self-care. The individual sessions will focus on individual goal-setting related to parenting and reflection on the parent-child relationship. The control group does not include the components of social support, affect regulation skills coaching, or guided parent-child interaction that are part of the experimental arm.</description>
