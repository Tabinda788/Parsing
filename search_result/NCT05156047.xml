    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pitolisant&#xD;
      compared with placebo in treating excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the impact of pitolisant on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient impression of the overall change in their IH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of overall symptoms of IH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator assessment of overall disease severity of IH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional status and activities of daily living in patients with IH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep-related impairment in patients with IH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep inertia in patients with IH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive function in patients with IH&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in adult patients&#xD;
      (ages ≥18 years) with IH. The study will consist of a Screening Period (up to 28 days), an&#xD;
      8-week Open-Label Phase, and a 4-week Double-Blind Randomized Withdrawal Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Open-Label Phase of the study will be 8 weeks, which includes a 6-week Dose Optimization&#xD;
      Period and a 2-week Stable Dose Period. In the Dose Optimization Period, all patients will be&#xD;
      titrated to their optimal dose of open-label pitolisant (17.8 mg or 35.6 mg) based on&#xD;
      Investigator assessment of tolerability and efficacy. The 3-week titration period will be&#xD;
      followed by 3 weeks of flexible dosing (weeks 4-6) during which patients will continue to&#xD;
      receive their optimal dose of 17.8 mg or 35.6 mg open-label pitolisant. Following completion&#xD;
      of the 6-week Dose Optimization Period, patients will enter the 2-week Stable Dose Period.&#xD;
      During this period, patients will remain at their optimal dose (the same dose they were&#xD;
      taking at the end of the Dose Optimization Period [17.8 mg or 35.6 mg]) of open-label&#xD;
      pitolisant for 2 weeks; dose adjustments are not allowed during the Stable Dose Period. At&#xD;
      the end of the Stable Dose Period, patients will be defined as responders or non-responders.&#xD;
      Responders will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive blinded study drug (pitolisant or&#xD;
      matching placebo) in the Double-Blind Randomized Withdrawal Phase of the study.&#xD;
      Non-responders will not be randomized to treatment in the Double-Blind Randomized Withdrawal&#xD;
      Phase and will complete two safety follow-up telephone contacts (TCs) at 15 (±3) days and 30&#xD;
      (+3) days after their final dose of open-label pitolisant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Double-Blind Randomized Withdrawal Phase, patients (approximately 64 patients per&#xD;
      treatment group) will receive blinded study drug either at the same dose they were taking in&#xD;
      the Stable Dose Period (17.8 mg or 35.6 mg pitolisant) or matching placebo. The duration of&#xD;
      the Double-Blind Randomized Withdrawal Phase will be 4 weeks (weeks 9-12); dose adjustments&#xD;
      are not permitted during this phase of the study. After completion of the Double-Blind&#xD;
      Randomized Withdrawal Phase (End-of Treatment [EOT] Visit is on Day 84, the last day of&#xD;
      blinded treatment), patients will complete two safety follow-up TCs with the site at 15 (±3)&#xD;
      days and 30 (+3) days after their final dose of blinded study drug, which will include&#xD;
      assessment for AEs and concomitant medication use; alternatively, patients will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to enroll in a long-term, open-label safety study under a separate protocol.&#xD;
      Patients that opt to enroll into the long-term, open-label study will not complete the 15 day&#xD;
      and 30 day follow-up TCs.&#xD;
