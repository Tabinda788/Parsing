      BACKGROUND: Long-acting injectable antiretroviral therapy (LAI-ART) is poised to&#xD;
      revolutionize HIV treatment and prevention. Community pharmacies could serve as another place&#xD;
      for people with HIV to get their ART injections. However, pharmacist and healthcare&#xD;
      practitioner attitudes towards pharmacist administration of LAI-ART are understudied.&#xD;
      Financial and human resources, pharmacist training, or changes in workflow have not been&#xD;
      outlined. Little is known about whether patients will accept ART injections given in&#xD;
      pharmacies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to address the above knowledge gaps. The&#xD;
      information generated can assist in the development of tools that can help scale community&#xD;
      pharmacy-based delivery of LAI-ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Using a mixed-methods approach to better understand the pre-implementation&#xD;
      environment, the study will employ electronic surveys and will administer semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews via telephone for three key stakeholder groups: HIV clinic staff members,&#xD;
      community pharmacists, and persons with HIV. Surveys will assess the appropriateness,&#xD;
      acceptability, and feasibility of LAI-ART administration in community pharmacies. A&#xD;
      semi-structured interview guide has been developed using constructs from the Consolidated&#xD;
      Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Comparisons between and across stakeholder&#xD;
      groups will be performed, looking for common themes as well as discrepancies.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to facilitate the future delivery of long-acting injectable&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy in community pharmacies by developing an in-depth understanding of&#xD;
      attitudes, barriers, and facilitators for implementing this intervention. The mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach will incorporate three quantitative implementation outcome measures (Acceptability&#xD;
      of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and Feasibility of&#xD;
      Intervention Measure) and semi-structured qualitative individual interviews which will be&#xD;
      analyzed for relevant themes. This would be considered pure implementation research of the&#xD;
      pre-implementation stage of LAI-ART administration in community pharmacies. Participants will&#xD;
      be purposively sampled from four different geographical sites (San Francisco Bay Area, Corpus&#xD;
      Christy Texas Area, Montgomery Alabama Area, and Miami/Hollywood Area) and over three&#xD;
      different key stakeholder groups (pharmacists, patients, clinic staff) to obtain a variety of&#xD;
      experiences, attitudes, and opinions. Most participants will have a single study visit which&#xD;
      consists of their interview. A small proportion of pharmacists will have a second study visit&#xD;
      for a follow up interview and questionnaire if their pharmacies have implemented a program to&#xD;
      administer LAI-ART or are close to launching one.&#xD;
