    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate the role of a convective&#xD;
      warming blanket to prevent hypothermia during sedation for an endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiography (ERC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), deep medical sedation of the patient is&#xD;
      routinely perform. Since ERC is a complex examination and in addition sometimes several&#xD;
      intervention steps are necessary (bougienage, dilatation, brush cytology, specimen&#xD;
      collection, insertion of plastic and metal stent prostheses), the sedation time is almost&#xD;
      always &gt; 30min, in many cases even up to one hour or longer. These patients are at risk for&#xD;
      developing hypothermia (drop in core body temperature below 36 degrees Celsius).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known from anesthesiologic research that even moderate perioperative hypothermia,&#xD;
      however, can have potentially serious complications. These include increased mortality,&#xD;
      cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and infarctions, coagulation disorders, and&#xD;
      increased transfusion requirements and wound infections. Changes in serum concentrations of&#xD;
      potassium and peripheral vasoconstriction with decrease in subcutaneous partial pressure of&#xD;
      oxygen are also clinically important side effects of perioperative hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the current 2014 German S3 guideline &quot;Sedation in gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot; does&#xD;
      not mention peri- or intra-interventional temperature measurement or temperature management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate the role of a convective&#xD;
      warming blanket to prevent hypothermia during sedation for an ERC. From the description of&#xD;
      various clinical endpoints, we seek to obtain sufficient evidence to support routine use of&#xD;
      such a system in ERC examinations. This study has the potential to set the new standard for&#xD;
      modern sedation during ERC interventions that recognizes the risk of hypothermia and&#xD;
      identifies a strategy to avoid it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, we will use a device, that is already routinely used in all operation rooms&#xD;
      in Germany, the so-called warm air device &quot;Twinwarm, Generation III&quot;. This device has a valid&#xD;
      CE mark and will be used according to its purpose &quot;pre-, intra- and postoperative maintenance&#xD;
      of the normothermic body temperature of the patient&quot;. The device will be used strictly in&#xD;
      accordance with the existing in-house SOP &quot;Heat Management&quot; of 04/2021 of the Department of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine of Hannover Medical School (MHH).&#xD;
