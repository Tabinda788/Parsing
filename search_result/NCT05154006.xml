  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Women Lift Safely! Intervention study aims to increase safe carrying behavior to reduce&#xD;
      health risks of heavy lifting in a rural area of Nepal (i.e. reducing weight and using safe&#xD;
      lifting techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Test whether a psychological intervention that promotes self-efficacy can promote women's&#xD;
      use of safe carrying behavior effectively compared to an information only control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Test whether including a social partner in the intervention is more effective than an&#xD;
      individual psychological intervention.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequent carrying of heavy loads bears health risks for women in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries, such as Nepal (Geere et al. 2018,2020; Koyucu et al., 2021; Walker &amp; Gunasekera,&#xD;
      2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent the physical health impacts of carrying heavy loads, e.g. pelvic organ prolapse,&#xD;
      research has shown that preventive behaviors in terms of applying safe carrying behaviors can&#xD;
      enable women to minimize adverse health outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reducing the carried load, especially during pregnancy and postpartum (Darshan, 2009;&#xD;
           Koyucu et al., 2021; MacDonald et al., 2013; Oxford University Hospitals, 2016; Sharma,&#xD;
           2012; SUVA, the Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund, 2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using safe lifting techniques (exhale, tighten pelvic floor and use a safe body posture&#xD;
           when lifting load) (Caagbay et al., 2020; Hagins et al., 2004)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study, the investigators identified low self-efficacy (belief in the own&#xD;
      capability to engage in healthy behavior) and insufficient social support (emotional,&#xD;
      practical or informational assistance by social partner) as reasons for risky carrying&#xD;
      behavior (Tomberge et al., 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3-arm parallel non-randomized controlled trial will be conducted in three rural villages in&#xD;
      the Kavre and Sindhupalanchowk districts of Nepal. The villages will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the three groups: (1) individual promotion of self-efficacy, (2) promotion of&#xD;
      self-efficacy + social support (3) active control group to test the effect of promoting&#xD;
      self-efficacy and the additional effect of social support on safe carrying behavior against&#xD;
      an information only control group. The latter, in the sense of a waiting list control group,&#xD;
      will receive the most effective intervention after completing the study. The assignment of&#xD;
      groups to the villages will be random (drawing lots by a person not included in the research&#xD;
      team). All participants from one village will receive the same intervention. This&#xD;
      village-based allocation of interventions prevents the transfer of information within the&#xD;
      village (spillover effect, Benjamin-Chung et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and informed consent procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The villages included were already part of the prestudy in 2019. 100 women from each of the&#xD;
      three villages and a self-selected social partner from the same or neighboring household&#xD;
      (e.g. husband, mother-in-law) having experience in carrying loads will be included (N = 600).&#xD;
      Households / Participants within the villages will be selected using the random route method&#xD;
      (Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik, 2003). Due to their acute vulnerability, women who are pregnant or who&#xD;
      have delivered in the last month will be approached specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arriving at the households, trained local research assistants will present themselves and&#xD;
      briefly inform about the study purpose and procedures in Nepali language. The respondents&#xD;
      willing to participate will be provided with more detailed explanation of the study both&#xD;
      verbally and with participant information sheets. Respondents will also be provided with&#xD;
      information and consent forms written in easy language and will be informed that the&#xD;
      participation will be voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since all the participants will be interviewed in personal communication with enumerators&#xD;
      with a professional background in health science the informed consent will be fully read out&#xD;
      to the participants and can be explained more deeply in case of any dubiety. After explaining&#xD;
      the content of the study the participant will ask the woman if she and also a self-selected&#xD;
      social partner are willing to participate in the study. If the women and the social partner&#xD;
      agree and all their doubts and questions are answered, they will be requested to sign the&#xD;
      informed consent sheet either by signature or thumbprint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training: Before the beginning of the study, the local team (practitioners graduated in&#xD;
      nursing sciences or physiotherapy and research assistants graduated in health/social&#xD;
      Sciences) will be trained in interviewing techniques and data collection tools. Additionally,&#xD;
      a pelvic physiotherapist will train them in instructing and assessing safe lifting&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training will last one week, 2 pretests in villages not part of the analyses included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Survey and Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistants will conduct baseline interviews in one village. They will collect&#xD;
      quantitative data in computer-assisted, structured face-to-face interviews with women and&#xD;
      their social partners and conduct structured behavioral observations of the women while&#xD;
      carrying a water-filled container. A local field coordinator will monitor the quality of data&#xD;
      during the data collection during fieldwork to reduce interviewer bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline interview, the households will be visited again by the health&#xD;
      practitioners in order to receive one of the three interventions to promote safe carrying&#xD;
      behaviors (information only control, individual promotion of self-efficacy, promotion of&#xD;
      self-efficacy + social support) for which the study participants will be blinded. The study&#xD;
      team cannot be blinded to condition, but the specific intervention assignment is concealed&#xD;
      until the arrival at the intervention site. The intervention will be delivered via household&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up survey to test intervention effects will be conducted 8 weeks after baseline.&#xD;
      In a debriefing after the follow up survey, the allocated intervention group will be revealed&#xD;
      to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research questions and hypotheses of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does the promotion of self-efficacy lead to more safe carrying behavior in women?&#xD;
&#xD;
           H1a: Women in the two intervention groups with self-efficacy promotion indicate&#xD;
           increased reduction of carried weight compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H1b: Women in the two intervention groups with self-efficacy promotion indicate&#xD;
           increased use of safe lifting techniques compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can adding social support by a social partner increase safe carrying behavior&#xD;
           additionally?&#xD;
&#xD;
           H2a: Women in the group with self-efficacy + social support indicate increased reduction&#xD;
           of carried weight compared to the group with individual self-efficacy promotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H2b: Women in the group with self-efficacy + social support indicate increased use of&#xD;
           safe lifting techniques compared to the group with individual self-efficacy promotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can the intervention effects on safe carrying behavior be explained by increased&#xD;
           self-efficacy?&#xD;
&#xD;
           H3a: The intervention effect on carried weight of the two intervention groups with&#xD;
           self-efficacy promotion compared to controls is explained by increased self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H3b: The intervention effect on the use of safe lifting techniques in the two&#xD;
           intervention groups with self-efficacy promotion compared to controls is explained by&#xD;
           increased self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H3c: The increased reduction of carried weight of the group self-efficacy + social&#xD;
           support compared to the group with individual self-efficacy promotion is explained by&#xD;
           increased self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H3d: The increased use of safe lifting techniques in the group self-efficacy + social&#xD;
           support compared to the group with individual self-efficacy promotion is explained by&#xD;
           increased self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can the intervention effects be explained by increased received social support? H4a: The&#xD;
           increased reduction of carried weight of the group self-efficacy + social support&#xD;
           compared to the group with individual self-efficacy promotion is explained by increased&#xD;
           social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H4b: The increased use of safe lifting techniques in the group self-efficacy + social&#xD;
           support compared to the group with individual self-efficacy promotion is explained by&#xD;
           increased social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H4c: The increased self-efficacy in the group self-efficacy + social support compared to&#xD;
           the group with individual self-efficacy promotion is explained by increased received&#xD;
           social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, the investigators will investigate the following exploratory research&#xD;
           questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Can the interventions increase women's self-efficacy and intention to reduce carried&#xD;
           weight in future pregnancies and postpartum?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is the reduction of carried weight related to an increased carrying frequency?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Does the intervention have an impact on other psychosocial determinants of carrying&#xD;
           behavior?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Can the interventions improve women's quality of life, and reduce strain during lifting,&#xD;
           pain, symptoms of incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, and perceived personal control&#xD;
           over symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Do the interventions have an impact on relationship quality with the social partner and/&#xD;
           or the social partners' behavior and attitudes towards safe carrying behavior?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori power analysis with a desired power of &gt; 95%, a significance level of Œ± = 0.05&#xD;
      and the assumption of medium effects (based on a study by Ernsting et al.,(2015)) resulted in&#xD;
      a required sample size of N = 251 to detect a significant difference between the three groups&#xD;
      when using repeated-measures ANCOVA (Faul et al., 2009). This analysis is based on including&#xD;
      six covariates (Outcome at baseline, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, education and&#xD;
      pregnancy status). Due to an expected dropout rate of up to 20% from baseline to follow-up&#xD;
      (Wood et al., 2004) we will recruit 100 women in each of the three villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of descriptive statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primary and secondary outcomes will be presented. For the evaluation of the intervention&#xD;
      effects, repeated measures covariance analyses (ANCOVA) with the two measurement points (pre/&#xD;
      post) will be calculated using the intervention groups as independent variables and reduced&#xD;
      weight and use of safe lifting techniques as well as self-efficacy and social support as&#xD;
      dependent variables. Further secondary outcomes, e.g. effects of the intervention on&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing and physical health symptoms, will be calculated additionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediation analyses will be carried out for self-efficacy and social support as mediators.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Carried weight will be assessed through the sum of two self-reported items referring to the weight carried in the last week. Open answers in kg.&#xD;
&quot;In the last 7 days, what was the usual weight of water you carried per trip?&quot; &quot;In the last 7 days, what was the usual weight of other loads (e.g. grass, fodder, firewood you carried per trip?&quot;</description>

    <measure>Index of self-reported safe lifting techniques during performance at follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>An index of safe lifting will be calculated by the product of a safe lifting score x self-reported frequency of using safe-lifting techniques, ranging from 0 (= never uses safe lifting techniques) to 7 (= always uses safe lifting techniques)&#xD;
Score: The participants will be asked to lift a water-filled container at local standard size. Lifting techniques will then be assessed through two self-reported items, e.g.:&#xD;
&quot;What did you do with your pelvic floor during lifting?&quot; 1 = &quot;Tightening&quot;; 0 &quot;Relax&quot;; 0 &quot;did not feel the pelvic floor&quot;; 0 = &quot;I don't know&quot;; 0 = &quot;other&quot;.&#xD;
The safe lifting score is calculated by summing the points of the two items, thus ranging from 0 (= unsafe lifting) to 2 (= safe lifting).&#xD;
Frequency: Average of two items &quot;In the last 7 days, how often did you tighten your pelvic floor when lifting loads?&quot;; &quot;In the last 7 days, how often did you exhale when lifting loads?&quot; Answer options 0 (= never) to 7 (= 7 out of the last 7 days).</description>

    <description>A secondary self-reported score assesses perception and use of pelvic floor muscles when lifting a water-filled container through two items with answering options coded 0 (= unsafe) or 1 (=safe) will serve to validate the answers given for the safe lifting score. The pelvic floor muscle score is calculated by summing the points:&#xD;
&quot;Did you feel any muscles tightening during lifting?&quot; &quot;If yes, which ones?&quot; 0 = &quot;Back&quot;; 0 = &quot;Stomach&quot;;0 = &quot;Legs&quot;; 0 = &quot;Head&quot;; 0 = &quot;Neck&quot;; 0 = &quot;Muscles of arms&quot;; 1 =&quot;Pelvic floor&quot; &quot;; 0 = &quot;Other.&#xD;
&quot;How did you tighten the pelvic floor muscles?&quot; 1 = &quot;Imagine stopping flow of urine&quot;; 1 = &quot;Feeling a lift inside the pelvis&quot;; 1 = &quot;Feeling a squeeze inside the pelvis&quot;; 1 = &quot;Small tightening of muscles in lower stomach&quot;; 0 = &quot;I don't know&quot;; 1 = &quot;other&quot;.</description>
