  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical experience of adding intraluminal brachytherapy with traditional applicator after&#xD;
      definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for local-regional thoracic esophageal cancer&#xD;
      is limited due to high complication risk and non-superiority in survival. The innovative&#xD;
      applicator can maximize the therapeutic efficacy by reducing dose inhomogeneity in the&#xD;
      esophageal wall, which will translate into less over-dosing and less risk of the side effects&#xD;
      of fistula or stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study by using new applicator is to observe the change in local&#xD;
      tumor control rate, while secondary goals are treatment related toxicity, progression-free&#xD;
      survival, and overall survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) provided guidelines for brachytherapy in esophageal&#xD;
      cancer in 1997, which defines the general principle for brachytherapy used in definitive&#xD;
      CCRT. (1) Patients with unifocal thoracic adeno- or squamous cancers &lt; or = 10 cm in length,&#xD;
      with no evidence of intra-abdominal or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Contraindications include tracheal or bronchial involvement, cervical esophagus location,&#xD;
      or stenosis that cannot be bypassed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) The esophageal brachytherapy applicator should have an external diameter of 6-10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (4) If 5FU-based chemotherapy and 45-50-Gy EBRT are used, recommended brachytherapy is HDR 10&#xD;
      Gy in two weekly fractions of 5 Gy each and should not be given concurrently with&#xD;
      chemotherapy In the esophageal cancer treatments, tumor recurrence in the primary tumor site&#xD;
      approaches 50% in most non-surgical CCRT series reported. Brachytherapy has the advantages of&#xD;
      introducing higher doses to the tumor site to improve tumor control, but it is like the&#xD;
      double edge of the sword, higher dose may bring higher risk of serious side effect, such as&#xD;
      fistula formation in the esophagus noted over previous studies. The innovative Braxx&#xD;
      applicator can maximize the therapeutic efficacy by reducing dose inhomogeneity in the&#xD;
      esophageal wall (3mm to surface: 136-175%), which will translate into less over-dosing and&#xD;
      less risk of the side effects of fistula or stenosis as noted in traditional brachytherapy&#xD;
      using NG tube (3mm to surface: 160%-265%). Without much changing the user's habits in&#xD;
      performing brachytherapy, the innovative applicator is expected to be easier to be accepted&#xD;
      for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Screening Phase: All non-T4b or M1 (non-nodal organ involvement) stage esophageal cancer&#xD;
      patients who received neoadjuvant/ definitive chemoradiation first, which includes&#xD;
      radiotherapy dosage between 4140-5040cGy concurrently with chemotherapy of carboplatin +&#xD;
      paclitaxel or cisplatin + 5FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluation for feasibility of surgery takes place 5-6 weeks after CCRT. Any subject&#xD;
           whose tumor status is resectable at evaluation but declines surgical proposal will be&#xD;
           eligible to be enrolled in the following study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patient receives consolidative CCRT, which includes EBRT dosage of 2000cGy&#xD;
           concurrently with chemotherapy of carboplatin + paclitaxel or cisplatin + 5FU as our&#xD;
           status quo.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Brachytherapy Study Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy protocol starts within 2 weeks after consolidative EBRT (This is &quot;Week 1&quot;),&#xD;
      subjects who are enrolled will receive brachytherapy with specified balloon applicator.&#xD;
      High-dose-rate (HDR) Nucletron brachytherapy system will be used in the treatment, 5-Gy per&#xD;
      fraction is delivered to the pre-treatment esophageal length of primary tumor(s), second&#xD;
      treatment will be finished within 2 weeks after the first one, a total of 10Gy in 2 fractions&#xD;
      will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distance from the center of radiation source to the surface of applicator is 6-9mm&#xD;
      depending on the air volume inflated into the balloons in the applicator, the esophageal&#xD;
      mucosa will be attached against to the surface of inflated balloon, radiation dose prescribed&#xD;
      at 3mm away from the balloon surface will cover most of the esophageal wall, and 5Gy will be&#xD;
      prescribed there. Efforts will be made to reduce the high dosage volume in adjacent normal&#xD;
      organs, also to reduce the hot spot within treated esophageal wall. It is NOT allowed to give&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy on the days of HDR brachytherapy. Grade 3 and higher grade toxicity&#xD;
      may cause a prolonged interval between the two brachytherapy treatments, either dose&#xD;
      reduction or delay treatment according to tolerability of individual patient is allowed. If&#xD;
      patient can't tolerate full course of brachytherapy, the total dose (EBRT+brachytherapy) can&#xD;
      be reduced to 25Gy without violation of protocol. The management of adverse effects will&#xD;
      follow general principles.&#xD;
