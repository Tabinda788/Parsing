  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT2527, a Cyclin-dependent Kinase 9 (CDK9)&#xD;
      inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to define the&#xD;
      dosing schedule, and maximally tolerated dose to be used in subsequent development of&#xD;
      PRT2527.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of PRT2527, a CDK9&#xD;
      inhibitor, evaluating patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including sarcomas,&#xD;
      castrate resistant prostate cancer, ER+/Her2- and triple negative breast cancer, and solid&#xD;
      tumors displaying MYC amplification. The study plan expects to evaluate approximately six&#xD;
      dose levels of approximately 3-6 patients per dose level; however additional dose levels may&#xD;
      be explored. Taking into account pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the preceding&#xD;
      dose levels, the dose may be escalated until a dose limiting toxicity is identified. Up to 21&#xD;
      patients may be enrolled at a dose shown to be tolerated for confirmation of the MTD and/or&#xD;
      RP2D, with a maximum of up to 100 patients total that may be enrolled.&#xD;
