      In addition to a medical history and clinical examination, the diagnosis of osteoporosis&#xD;
      includes the measurement of bone surface density by means of dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).&#xD;
      In addition, blood tests are performed for certain parameters, such as vitamin D, calcium,&#xD;
      phosphate and C-reactive protein. In order to optimize osteoporosis diagnostics, the&#xD;
      development of further specific methods is required. The modulation of the immune system&#xD;
      seems promising in this respect, since osteoporosis is based on an inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
      Various regulatory markers of the innate and acquired immune system, which seem to be&#xD;
      relevant in the development of the disease, have already been detected in osteoporosis&#xD;
      patients. This study may help to gain new insights into disease-associated immunoregulatory&#xD;
      markers that could revolutionize both the diagnosis and therapy of osteoporosis in the long&#xD;
      term. By means of a simple blood test, patients could be diagnosed early and without&#xD;
      additional radiation exposure, and effective therapy options could be developed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a disease of bone metabolism. The underlying disturbance of bone homeostasis&#xD;
      promotes bone fractures and, in advanced stages, especially spontaneous fractures. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of osteoporosis is carried out as part of routine clinical practice. In addition to&#xD;
      the patient's medical history and clinical examination, blood tests are also carried out on&#xD;
      certain parameters, including the concentrations of vitamin D, calcium and phosphate as well&#xD;
      as C-reactive protein. In addition, bone density is measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DXA). The results can be used to determine the degree of osteoporosis, which affects the&#xD;
      further therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy is essentially based on fracture prevention through optimization of dietary habits,&#xD;
      promotion of physical activity, and adequate vitamin D intake. Pharmacological options mainly&#xD;
      do not counteract the pathological bone loss and are usually not tolerable due to serious&#xD;
      side effects or are only approved for a limited period of use. Consequently, the development&#xD;
      of further options to complement existing methods is required for the diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      of osteoporosis. The modulation of the immune system seems to be promising, since&#xD;
      osteoporosis is based on an inflammatory reaction. Thus, various regulatory markers of the&#xD;
      innate and acquired immune system, which seem to be relevant in the development of the&#xD;
      disease, have already been detected in osteoporosis patients. However, central questions&#xD;
      regarding the immune phenotype of affected individuals remain unanswered. For example, it is&#xD;
      unclear to what extent certain molecules, mostly growth factors or chemokines, influence the&#xD;
      inflammatory processes in the context of osteoporosis. Furthermore, it is controversial&#xD;
      whether and, if so, how immune markers influence each other and what effects this has on bone&#xD;
      metabolism.In the long term, new insights regarding the properties of disease-associated&#xD;
      immunoregulatory markers could revolutionize the diagnostic possibilities for osteoporosis,&#xD;
      as affected individuals could be identified early and without additional radiation exposure&#xD;
      by simple blood tests. Equally relevant is corresponding information for the improvement of&#xD;
      therapy. In the future, the causative immune processes could be treated by regulating the&#xD;
      corresponding immunological markers and meaningfully expand existing therapy options.&#xD;

    <description>Standardized values for the diagnosis of osteoporosis are examined in the blood samples taken. In addition, one serum sample and one EDTA sample (S-Monofat, Sarstedt AG &amp; Co. KG, Nümbrecht, Germany, 7.5 ml each) are taken in order to analyze the immunophenotype on the cellular level as well as on the basis of soluble markers. Following the puncture, these samples are processed in the research laboratory of the Clinic for Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery and examined using various immunoassays.</description>

    <description>In addition to the medical history and clinical examination, all patients included in the study will complete a questionnaire to exclude a secondary form of osteoporosis. Among other things, previous occurrence of (spontaneous) fractures of the patients as well as the family history with regard to other diseases and fractures will be asked. The questionnaire is based on the S3 guideline of the German Osteoporosis Organization.</description>
