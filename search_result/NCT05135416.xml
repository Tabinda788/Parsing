      Surgical interventions, such as restoring the health of patients and eliminating their&#xD;
      existing symptoms, the surgical process can have many negative effects on the patient. In&#xD;
      order to minimize these complications, the Accelerated Recovery Protocol After Surgery (ERAS)&#xD;
      has also found widespread use in obstetric surgery. The ERAS protocol consists of different&#xD;
      evidence-based practices at each stage, before, during, and after surgery. Stool and gas&#xD;
      extraction, especially colorectal reported that chewing gum has a positive impact on the&#xD;
      time/ can be used after pelvic surgical procedures, perioperative care guide contains&#xD;
      reported in ERAS protocols, evidence-based, inexpensive, easily applied, and easily tolerated&#xD;
      a practice that is emphasized.&#xD;

      a practice that is emphasized. Different studies have been conducted to determine the effect&#xD;
      of chewing gum on intestinal peristalsis. Intestinal sounds and defecation of chewing gum&#xD;
      after cesarean section surgery. A limited number of studies on patients with total&#xD;
      laparoscopic hysterectomy exist on this topic.&#xD;

    <description>Questions related to surgery and bowel function found in the Participant Information Form it will be filled in. The chewing gum group data will be followed up with the &quot;Follow-up Form- Chewing Gum Group &quot;. Women who make up the gum group, based on the time of arrival in the room 2. per hour, 4. and 6 o'clock. they'll chew gum an hour. Chewing gum based on knowledge of the literature its duration will be limited to 15 minutes, and a new gum will be introduced with each chewing. To all women the same brand will be given unsweetened chewing gum, which is easy to chew, does not contain sorbitol and xylitol. Sorbitol GIS problems in the case of ingestion of gums containing it, while gums containing xylitol are more in order not to ignore the decongestant risk of diarrhea when consumed, sugar-free chewing gum was preferred.</description>

The control group data were followed up with the &quot;Follow-up Form-Control Group&quot; will be. Of the women who made up the control group, it was not until the bowel sounds were first heard that bowel sounds will be listened to by the service nurse december 2 hours intervals. The patient has gas-stool by querying the output, it will be saved. Application of analgesics to pain levelsin the case of &quot;Visual Analog Scale&quot; (Visual Analog Scale -Vas) within 15 minutes it will be evaluated with. After the end of the researcher's 8-hour shift, the time of gas extraction and defecation is estimated since it cannot be done, women can set the time of gas extraction and defecation as time/date; they'll record it. Assessment of pain level, first 8. After the time of 16 and 24. in the hours will be made.</description>
