  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-blinded, open-label, single-arm,&#xD;
      comparator study will enroll up to 100 eligible subjects from multiple sites undergoing LAAC&#xD;
      procedure to evaluate the safety and performance of the KALPA™ mapping, imaging and&#xD;
      navigation device in patients undergoing Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will undergo pre-procedural cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) no&#xD;
      more than 1 year prior to the performance of the LAAC procedure to evaluate left atrial&#xD;
      appendage (LAA) anatomy. Before and after a transseptal puncture, the right atrium (RA), left&#xD;
      atrial appendage (LAA), and left upper superior pulmonary vein (LUSPV) will be mapped using&#xD;
      the KALPA™ system in combination with a commercially available catheter. Subjects will then&#xD;
      undergo LAAC as per routine clinical care. Following implantation of the LAAC device,&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for the peri-device leak (PDL) with a transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiogram (TEE) as well as PDL assessment using the KALPA X™ system (the operator will&#xD;
      be blinded to KALPA X™ PDL reading). The entire LAAC procedure will be conducted as customary&#xD;
      practice using standard and approved off-the-shelf equipment (body surface electrodes,&#xD;
      catheters, etc.) the operator will be blinded to the KALPA™ and KALPA X™ system information.&#xD;
      The physician will neither use nor rely on any of the KALPA™ or KALPA X™system output for&#xD;
      clinical decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will then undergo cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and TEE at 45&#xD;
      days following the index LAAC procedure to assess residual PDL. Intra-procedure PDL post-LAAC&#xD;
      assessed by KALPA X™ will be compared to the detection of PDL by TEE. The value of PDL as&#xD;
      measured by TEE compared to KALPA X™ at the time of the index LAAC procedure in predicting&#xD;
      PDL at 45 days post-LAAC as assessed by CCTA will be compared.&#xD;
