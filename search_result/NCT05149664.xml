  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All evaluable subjects will receive VibratoSleeve therapeutic ultrasound (TUS) treatments.&#xD;
      The device will be programmed to deliver TUS at a pre-determined level. Three different&#xD;
      acoustic intensity levels will be tested during the first three treatment visits (one at each&#xD;
      visit day). The most effective treatment that is comfortable to a subject will be prescribed&#xD;
      for the remaining treatment sessions. Treatment time will be 90 minutes per session, one&#xD;
      session per day. Thirty treatment sessions will be performed over a 45-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will appear for on-site follow-up visits at 1-, 3-, and 6-months following subject's&#xD;
      last (30th) treatment session.&#xD;

      Screening procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will be recruited for participation and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained after all information is presented and all questions are answered to the patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction. Once informed consent is obtained, the study team will confirm the patient&#xD;
      meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is a list of all assessments and tests that are required during the screening&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, demographics, and Rutherford Class, vital signs, &amp; circumference&#xD;
           measurement of one calf.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ankle Brachial Index and Toe Brachial Index (ABI/TBI) will be measured at screening to&#xD;
           determine eligibility and baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonography and Perfusion Imaging of the Foot will be undertaken prior to, during&#xD;
           and after application of the VibratoSleeve TUS. All patients will undergo arterial&#xD;
           duplex ultrasound at the level of the calf, ankle and/or foot to document the baseline&#xD;
           vessel diameter, vessel velocity and volume flow. Perfusion imaging of the foot will be&#xD;
           completed, using non-invasive methods like Flowmet by Medtronic, Inc. and Clarifi system&#xD;
           by Modulim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial three VibratoSleeve therapy sessions in this study will be performed at a&#xD;
      clinical research center (VISOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only subjects who have met all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      receive therapy. The device will be fitted and operated by Vibrato team member(s) while&#xD;
      accompanied by site study staff. Study-related imaging will be performed by licensed vascular&#xD;
      ultrasound technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After pre-treatment imaging, Vibrato staff will fit the device to the posterior calf and&#xD;
      couple it to skin with ultrasound gel. Therapy will be initiated using a Vibrato generator,&#xD;
      gradually increasing acoustic output over the first 5 minutes of therapy to a nominal goal&#xD;
      peak negative pressure, while assessing patient comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first three 90-minute therapy sessions, ABI, TBI, ultrasonography and perfusion&#xD;
      imaging of foot will be performed pre-treatment, during the 90-minute treatment, and&#xD;
      immediately after the end of treatment, using identical methods to those described for&#xD;
      screening (see above). It should be noted that ultrasound administration can be immediately&#xD;
      stopped at any point in the 90-minute treatment period if there is significant subject&#xD;
      discomfort or any evidence of an adverse event. Adverse events (if any) will also be recorded&#xD;
      and assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment measurements are completed, each subject will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire to capture subject's therapeutic experience. The feedback obtained may be used&#xD;
      in developing future design enhancements of the VibratoSleeve device and/or a future pivotal&#xD;
      trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first three of 30 scheduled therapy sessions are completed, 25 of the remaining 27&#xD;
      sessions may be done at either the clinic or the patient's home, based upon subject's&#xD;
      convenience and preference. A Vibrato representative will be present for all treatments to&#xD;
      ensure proper operation and protocol compliance. No diagnostic/perfusion measurements will be&#xD;
      taken during at-home sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mid-treatment session (number 15 +/- 2 sessions) and the last session (number 30) will be&#xD;
      done in identical manner to the first treatment in the clinic, including all the perfusion&#xD;
      measurements. After the final 30th treatment, subjects will commit to 1-, 3-, and 6-month&#xD;
      follow up visits to assess the durability of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 30 treatments will be done within 45 days to allow subjects the option of receiving&#xD;
      treatments 5 days per week, over a 6-week time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-, three- and six-month follow up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each follow-up visit, the subject will receive the same diagnostic and perfusion&#xD;
      measurements as carried out during treatment sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABI/TBI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonography at calf level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perfusion Imaging of foot&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (if any) will also be identified, recorded and assessed, not only for&#xD;
           clinic visits but also for at-home treatments.&#xD;
