  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this cluster-randomized trial in rural Guatemala is to assess intervention&#xD;
      strategies to reduce plastic burning in 8 intervention villages compared to 8 control&#xD;
      villages. The intervention group participants will participate in 12 weekly behavioral&#xD;
      working group sessions; the control group will not receive any specific activities. Two&#xD;
      hundred women of reproductive age as well as other community members from these villages will&#xD;
      be enrolled in each group. The follow-up period is 12 months. A Community Advisory Board will&#xD;
      be formed in order to provide input on study activities, evaluate working group intervention&#xD;
      strategies, and discuss the potential to expand activities regionally. Data will be collected&#xD;
      via interviews, focus groups, air pollution sampling, plastic waste collection, urinary&#xD;
      biomarker assessments, and ambient air sampling. Program evaluation and results dissemination&#xD;
      will occur in the last year of the project.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Household air pollution from solid fuel combustion (e.g., wood) is a major environmental risk&#xD;
      factor in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for an estimated 2.6 million deaths&#xD;
      annually (World Health Organization, 2018). The contribution of plastic waste incineration in&#xD;
      household fires has not been quantified. This is problematic for countries like Guatemala,&#xD;
      where 71% of households burn waste as a primary means of disposal (Government of the Republic&#xD;
      of Guatemala 2019). Plastic waste incineration is a critical, but understudied, public health&#xD;
      and environmental hazard, as communities are inundated with cheap plastic without the means&#xD;
      of safely disposing of plastic waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to conduct a cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the uptake and&#xD;
      sustainability of intervention strategies to reduce use, recycle, and repurpose plastic that&#xD;
      will lead to reductions in household-level plastic burning in selected villages in rural&#xD;
      Guatemala. The 200 intervention group participants, along with other interested community&#xD;
      members, will participate in 12 weekly behavioral working group sessions. Each intervention&#xD;
      community will commit to alternatives to burning plastic and drive initiatives they can&#xD;
      achieve over the next 9 months. The 200 control group participants will not receive any&#xD;
      specific activities until year 5 when dissemination of results will include control villages.&#xD;
      . Primary outcomes include personal air pollution exposure, comparison of urinary biomarkers&#xD;
      of exposure to plastic combustion, quantification of emissions estimated or air pollutants&#xD;
      from plastic incineration, Health-related Quality of Life, self-efficacy and social cohesion,&#xD;
      and implementation quality and fidelity of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first year, formative research involving a rapid assessment, formation of a Community&#xD;
      Advisory Board, working group refinement, and a working group pilot will occur. The&#xD;
      implementation science Capabilities-Opportunities-Motivations-Behavior (COM-B) framework will&#xD;
      guide the development of the behavioral intervention (community working groups) during the&#xD;
      formative phase. In Years 2 - 4 (the main trial), data collection will include participant&#xD;
      surveys (at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months), the community working groups (12 weeks),&#xD;
      focus groups (month 12), biomarker (urine) collection (baseline, 4 months and 12 months),&#xD;
      plastic waste collection (baseline and 4 months), and modeling activities around emissions&#xD;
      scenarios and regional air quality. In Year 5, program evaluation will occur, and results&#xD;
      will be disseminated to the participating intervention and control communities and to&#xD;
      regional and national policymakers.&#xD;
