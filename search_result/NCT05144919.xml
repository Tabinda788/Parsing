  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agricultural biodiversity can have an important role in improving diet diversity, quality and&#xD;
      nutrition and can be seen as the foundation of the food and nutrition value chain. Increasing&#xD;
      the availability and access to local agricultural and/or wild biodiversity genetic resources&#xD;
      has the potential to increase production, making more food available for consumption as long&#xD;
      as entitlements to access it exist. However, as the history of food security interventions&#xD;
      has shown, increasing the production and supply of staple crops alone is not enough to&#xD;
      improve food security or nutritional status. However, while agricultural diversification is&#xD;
      an important component, it is not alone sufficient to improve diet diversity. Other system&#xD;
      elements including women's education and knowledge, intra-household dynamics and women's&#xD;
      status and cultural beliefs and practices that improves children's health and nutrition are&#xD;
      important to ensure biodiversity has a successful role in improving dietary diversity and&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  villages: Characterized as Thai village. Only Thai villages will be selected for the&#xD;
             study as agriculture practices, diets, food preferences, language and cultures can&#xD;
             change drastically between ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  participants: i) Woman of reproductive age (between 15-49 years) who are the mother or&#xD;
             primary caregiver of a child between 12 and 23 months of age. This age group is part&#xD;
             of the critical 1000 day window for child development and marks the time when young&#xD;
             children can potentially consume all foods from the household pot and consume a more&#xD;
             diverse diet. As such, it is from this age group that biodiversity can have an effect&#xD;
             on children's diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii) Both the woman and the child should be permanent residents in the village selected and&#xD;
        do not temporarily migrate outside the village cluster during the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  villages: Urban center of commune/province as these villages/cities do not have&#xD;
             agriculture or home garden opportunities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  participants: currently engaged in other agriculture or nutrition programme or&#xD;
             intervention apart from what is offered by government extension workers&#xD;
