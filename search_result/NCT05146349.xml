  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Retaining Employment and Talent after Injury/Illness Network (RETAIN) demonstration is a&#xD;
      collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the Social Security&#xD;
      Administration (SSA) to improve employment outcomes for individuals who experience injuries&#xD;
      or illnesses that put them at risk of exiting the labor force and relying on disability&#xD;
      programs and other public supports in the long term. RETAIN projects include a combination of&#xD;
      medical provider services, stay-at-work/return-to-work (SAW/RTW) coordination services, and&#xD;
      other SAW/RTW services.This evaluation will focus on the Minnesota Department of Employment&#xD;
      and Economic Development implementation of &quot;Minnesota RETAIN&quot; statewide. The evaluation will&#xD;
      document how the project is implemented, describe enrollees, estimate the project's impacts&#xD;
      on enrollees' outcomes, and assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development works with state and local&#xD;
      partners, including the Mayo Clinic, to implement &quot;MN RETAIN&quot; statewide. SSA contracted with&#xD;
      Mathematica to conduct an independent evaluation of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the RETAIN model medical providers receive training and incentives to use occupational&#xD;
      health best practices. The state agency also coordinates SAW/RTW services for the enrollee,&#xD;
      fosters communication among MN RETAIN stakeholders about the treatment enrollee returning to&#xD;
      work, and monitors the enrollee's medical and employment progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minnesota uses a multi-method approach toward recruitment that includes referrals from health&#xD;
      care providers, screening of Family and Medical Leave Act forms filed by injured or ill&#xD;
      workers, screening daily emergency department visit logs, reviewing provider clinical&#xD;
      calendars to identify workers with injuries or illness affecting employability, outreach to&#xD;
      employers, marketing to the general public within the state via social media campaigns, and&#xD;
      self-referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation team randomly assigns each enrollee to either a treatment group that is&#xD;
      eligible to receive the full set of RETAIN intervention activities or a control group that is&#xD;
      not. The evaluation team then compares the outcomes of the treatment and control groups and&#xD;
      gathers evidence on how MN RETAIN shaped the outcomes of enrollees who were eligible for its&#xD;
      services, regardless of whether they participated in those services. Data sources include&#xD;
      enrollment data, surveys, administrative records, program data, and qualitative data.&#xD;
