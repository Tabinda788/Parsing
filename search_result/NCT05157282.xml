      In support of the long-term goal of developing new strategies to increase limb function after&#xD;
      SCI, the objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Examine the behavioral and physiological&#xD;
      effects of TESS on upper-limb muscles after cervical SCI; and 2) Maximize the recovery of&#xD;
      reaching and grasping potential by using tailored TESS in a task-specific manner with motor&#xD;
      training. Veterans with cervical spinal injuries and healthy volunteers will be recruited for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current studies demonstrate that electrical spinal stimulation, either invasive or&#xD;
      noninvasive, can play an important role in rehabilitation strategies aimed at improving limb&#xD;
      function in humans with SCI (Taccola et al., 2018). Among current stimulation strategies, one&#xD;
      of the most promising candidates to emerge in recent years is transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      spinal stimulation (TESS). TESS is a noninvasive technique that can be tailored to the needs&#xD;
      of each individual, where several segments of the spinal cord can be stimulated at the same&#xD;
      time, and delivery can be programed to interact with a rehabilitation strategy during&#xD;
      functional movements, such as reaching or grasping. A key element to TESS is its ability to&#xD;
      access spared spinal cord networks with minimal discomfort. Although promising, the knowledge&#xD;
      of TESS remains limited in scope and more studies are needed to further identify its&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1, subjects will participate in two randomized sessions: 1) TESS, and 2) sham-TESS.]&#xD;
      In Aim 2, the investigators will examine the effect of stimulation and training for a total&#xD;
      of 20 sessions (3 to 5 per week). Participants will be randomly assigned to: [1) Closed-loop&#xD;
      TESS applied during grasping + training, or 2) Closed-loop TESS applied during reaching +&#xD;
      training.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1 Subjects with SCI and without SCI (controls) will participate in two testing sessions,&#xD;
      separated by 2-3 days, using a crossover design. In each session, TESS or sham-TESS will be&#xD;
      applied over the cervical spinal cord. Functional and physiological measures will be acquired&#xD;
      before and after each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2 Develop methodologies to promote recovery of reaching and grasping movements. To&#xD;
      accomplish this goal, the investigators will combine TESS applied in a closed-loop manner&#xD;
      with massed practice upper-limb training. Participants will be assigned to one of three&#xD;
      groups in a randomized order using a sham controlled design: [1) Closed-loop TESS applied&#xD;
      during grasping + training, 2) Closed-loop TESS applied during reaching + training, and 3)&#xD;
      Closed-loop TESS applied during grasping &amp; reaching + training.] TESS for 20-min will be&#xD;
      followed by 60 min of massed practice exercise training (total=20 sessions).&#xD;

Dorsal sensation: (3 locations, each scored 0-4, sum=0-12)&#xD;
Palmar sensation: (3 locations, each scored 0-4, sum=0-12)&#xD;
Strength: (10 muscles of arm and hand, motor score 0-5, sum=0-50)&#xD;
Prehension ability: (3 grasps (cylindrical, lateral key, tip to tip), each scored 0-4, sum=0-12)&#xD;
Prehension performance: There are 6 prehension tasks. Pouring water from a bottle, opening jars, picking up and turning a key, transferring 9 pegs from board to board, picking up four coins and place in slots, screwing four nuts onto bolts. Each task is scored 0-5, sum=0-30.</description>
