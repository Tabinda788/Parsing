  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IRIS study aims to investigate the way Mepolizumab affects the structure of the airway&#xD;
      cells in patients with Severe Eosinophilic Asthma and how the immune function of these cells&#xD;
      changes with treatment. The aim is to take samples of cells from the airways before starting&#xD;
      Mepolizumab and after 6 months of treatment. These samples will be taken during a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy (a camera test looking into the lungs) and we will analyse these cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory. These investigations will allow us to better understand how Mepolizumab affects&#xD;
      the cells within the airways.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      IRIS is a prospective observational study investigating Mepolizumab in the treatment of&#xD;
      severe eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eosinophilic airway inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and is&#xD;
      particularly relevant in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA), in which standard asthma therapies&#xD;
      fail to adequately control the disease. In severe asthma, there is bronchial epithelial&#xD;
      damage and loss of tight junction integrity, goblet cell hyperplasia, enhanced collagen&#xD;
      generation within the airway wall and impaired innate immune responses. Mepolizumab has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce exacerbations and improve disease control in SEA but there are no studies&#xD;
      assessing the impact of Mepolizumab on structural airway cell activity and function and&#xD;
      airway remodelling processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate changes within bronchial epithelial cells following completion of 6 months (7&#xD;
      doses) of Mepolizumab using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Frac-seq (subcellular&#xD;
      fractionation and RNA-sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the following after completing treatment with 6 months of Mepolizumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Changes in epithelial barrier integrity using Frac-seq, transepithelial resistance ii)&#xD;
      Changes in epithelial antiviral responses fusing Frac-seq in unstimulated and virus-infected&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Changes in airway remodelling by assessing the profile of fibroblasts isolated from&#xD;
      bronchial biopsies employing Frac-seq and immunostaining of bronchial biopsies iv) Evaluate&#xD;
      the impact on peripheral airways by obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral&#xD;
      airway brushings for Frac-seq analysis and protein analysis v) Peripheral airway dysfunction&#xD;
      using impulse oscillometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives i) Evaluation of neural structural changes using biopsies&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited from University Hospital Southampton (UHS). UHS operates a&#xD;
        regional specialist clinical severe asthma service, prescribing biological therapies,&#xD;
        including Mepolizumab. Patients will be exclusively recruited from a pool of patients&#xD;
        awaiting biological therapies for severe asthma at these centres. Patients are only&#xD;
        eligible for Mepolizumab following NICE mandated multidisciplinary team approval reviewing&#xD;
        biological eligibility, treatment adherence and satisfaction that other co-morbid&#xD;
        conditions have been satisfactorily addressed.&#xD;
