    <textblock>
      Prior evidence suggests that capsinoids ingestion may increase resting energy expenditure&#xD;
      (EE) and fat oxidation (FATox) in humans, although whether they can modulate those parameters&#xD;
      during exercise conditions remains poorly understood. Investigators aimed to determine the&#xD;
      effects of dihydrocapsiate (DHC) ingestion on EE and FATox during an acute bout of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise at FATmax intensity (the intensity that elicits maximal fat oxidation [MFO] during&#xD;
      exercise) in overweight/obese men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 sedentary overweight/obese men participated in this randomized, triple-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover trial. On the first day, participants underwent a submaximal&#xD;
      exercise test in a cycloergometer to determine their MFO and FATmax intensity during&#xD;
      exercise. After 72 hours had elapsed, the participants returned in 2 further days (≥ 72 hours&#xD;
      apart) and performed a 60 min steady-state test (SST, i.e., cycling at their FATmax, constant&#xD;
      intensity) after ingesting either 12 mg of DHC or placebo; these conditions were randomized.&#xD;
      Respiratory gas exchange was monitored by indirect calorimetry. Serum markers concentrations&#xD;
      (glucose, triglycerides, and non-esterified fatty acids), skin temperature, thermal&#xD;
      perception, heart rate and perceived fatigue were assessed as secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      The study protocol and design have been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      the University of Granada (n°839/CEIH/2019) and the Servicio Andaluz de Salud and adhered to&#xD;
      the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were asked to confirm having commuted to the research center by car, bus, tram,&#xD;
      or motorcycle, having slept, as usual, having refrained from stimulant beverages within 24 h,&#xD;
      and having avoided any moderate or vigorous physical activity within 24 h and 48 h&#xD;
      (respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, in the first visit, sociodemographic and lifestyle data were registered, and medical&#xD;
      screening was performed, blood samples were collected, and anthropometry and body composition&#xD;
      measures were taken. On the second visit, the MFO during exercise and cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness (peak volume of oxygen consumption, VO2 peak) were respectively assessed through a&#xD;
      submaximal exercise test coupled to a maximal effort test. On visits third and fourth,&#xD;
      participants performed a 60 min steady-state exercise bout on a cycle ergometer at FATmax&#xD;
      intensity (i.e., at the intensity at which MFO is elicited) after having ingested either 12&#xD;
      mg of DHC or placebo. The conditions (DHC or placebo) on visits 3 and 4 were randomized. The&#xD;
      washout period between visits 3 and 4 was ≥72 h. Of note, all exercise tests took place at a&#xD;
      strictly controlled temperature of 22-23 ºC, given that environmental temperature largely&#xD;
      influences EE and FATox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXTENDED METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL SCREENING, SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION, AND ANTHROPOMETRY AND BODY COMPOSITION&#xD;
      ASSESSMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first visit, participants arrived at the research center at 08:00 h, in fasting&#xD;
      conditions (8 h). Participants were informed about the study protocols details and gave their&#xD;
      oral and written informed consent to participate in the study. Sociodemographic data and data&#xD;
      related to participants´ dietary habits (including pungent consumption), appetite, physical&#xD;
      activity levels, sleep, and other lifestyle habits were recorded by questionnaires (some of&#xD;
      them filled at home). Afterward, a medical doctor conducted an anamnesis to ensure that each&#xD;
      participant was in suitable physical conditions to participate in the study and to practice&#xD;
      exercise. Next, participants underwent an electrocardiogram in resting conditions, which was&#xD;
      conducted by an expert medical doctor. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also&#xD;
      measured with an automatic sphygmomanometer (Omron M2; Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). These&#xD;
      measurements were repeated on 3 consecutive occasions and the average systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure were calculated. Only participants presenting a non-risk medical history and&#xD;
      normal electrocardiogram were allowed to participate in the study. Blood samples were&#xD;
      collected from the antecubital vein in the morning (8.00-9.00 am), with subjects sitting and&#xD;
      in resting conditions. Blood samples were collected in serum Vacutainer Tubes® (Vacutainer®&#xD;
      SST™ II Advance tubes) and centrifuged following the manufacturer's instructions. Afterward,&#xD;
      serum samples were sent to the hospital lab for the analysis of the analytes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry and body composition assessments also took place on the first visit. Body&#xD;
      weight and height were measured (no shoes, light clothing) using a model 799 Seca scale and&#xD;
      stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Waist circumference was measured twice at the minimum&#xD;
      perimeter area with a measuring tape (mm precision), and the mean value was calculated. For&#xD;
      those participants with abdominal obesity, waist circumference was measured just above the&#xD;
      umbilicus (horizontal plane). Body fat mass and percentage, lean body mass, and visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissue (VAT) mas were then measured by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (HOLOGIC, Discovery Wi, Marlborough, MA). Body mass, lean mass, and fat mass indexes were&#xD;
      calculated as kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBMAXIMAL AND MAXIMAL EXERCISE TESTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second visit, individuals arrived at the research center normally between 15:30 and&#xD;
      19:00. Participants confirmed having met the above-stated pre-experimental conditions, as&#xD;
      well as arriving in fasting conditions (5-6 h) and having followed a standardized diet that&#xD;
      participants were instructed to follow during the previous day. Then, participants urinated,&#xD;
      dressed as above, and entered a quiet, warm (22-23 °C) room. A submaximal-graded exercise&#xD;
      test was performed (to determine the MFO) coupled to a maximum effort test (used to determine&#xD;
      the VO2peak) employing an Ergoselect 200 cycle ergometer (Ergoline GmbH, Lindenstrasse,&#xD;
      Germany). More in detail, the submaximal exercise protocol coupled to indirect calorimetry&#xD;
      started with a 3 min stage at 20 watts (W) as a warm-up, followed by increments of 20 W every&#xD;
      3 min, until resting exchange ratio (RER) was ≥1 at least for 30 s (as determined by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry). At this point, the maximal exercise protocol started (with no interruptions),&#xD;
      and increments of 20 W took place every 1 min until volitional exhaustion was reached, or&#xD;
      participants had to stop because of peripherical fatigue. Of note, the cycling power values&#xD;
      (W) at which MFO happened for each individual were used as the target exercise intensity&#xD;
      (i.e. FATmax) for the subsequent steady-state tests. Through the exercise test, participants'&#xD;
      perceived fatigue was assessed using a rating of the reported perceived exertion (RPE) scale,&#xD;
      and heart rate was measured using a Polar RS800 heart-rate monitor (Polar Electro Inc.,&#xD;
      Woodbury, NY, USA). Respiratory gas exchange was monitored with a CPX Ultima CardioO2 system&#xD;
      (Medical Graphics Corp., St Paul, MN) with a facemask model 7400 (Hans Rudolph Inc., Kansas&#xD;
      City, MO), and a preVent™ metabolic flow sensor (Medical Graphics Corp.). Oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (VO2) was measured using a galvanic fuel cell and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) was&#xD;
      assessed using a non-dispersive infrared sensor. According to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations, the gas analyzer was calibrated using standard gas concentrations&#xD;
      immediately before each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEADY-STATE EXERCISE TESTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the third visit (≥72 h after the second day), and again on the fourth visit (≥72 h later&#xD;
      to avoid carry-out effects), participants came to the laboratory and underwent the&#xD;
      steady-state tests after the ingestion of DHC or placebo, in a randomized order. Participants&#xD;
      arrived at the same time as on the second visit and confirmed having met exactly the same&#xD;
      pre-experimental conditions. Participants urinated, dressed in standard clothing, and entered&#xD;
      a quiet, warm (22-23 °C) room. A Polar RS800 heart-rate monitor was placed on their chest&#xD;
      using a chest wrap band. Then, a set of 16 DS-1922 L Button TM wireless thermometers&#xD;
      (Thermochron, Dallas, TX, USA) were attached to the subject's skin in different places to&#xD;
      monitor skin temperature changes through the experiment. They were put on the forehead, left&#xD;
      pectoralis, left elbow region, left index fingertip, left forearm, rear neck central area,&#xD;
      right clavicula, right deltoid, right shinbone, right sub-clavicular area, right&#xD;
      supra-clavicular area, right thigh, and upper breastbone. Afterward, participants sat and&#xD;
      stay relaxed for 10 min (resting period, timepoint -20´), and were instructed not to move nor&#xD;
      cross their arms and legs, and their baseline skin temperature and heart rate measures were&#xD;
      taken. The first intravenous blood sample was collected 10 min before starting the&#xD;
      steady-state test (timepoint -10'). Immediately 3 min after the first blood collection&#xD;
      (timepoint -7'), participants ingested either 12 mg of DHC (4 pills 3 mg each one) or&#xD;
      placebo. Then participants sat in the cycle ergometer where the steady-state tests would be&#xD;
      performed, and a gas mask was put on for the gases exchange measurement. The same metabolic&#xD;
      cart as on the second visit was used. The gas collection started 1 min before the beginning&#xD;
      of the steady-state test (timepoint -1') with the participants sitting in the cycle ergometer&#xD;
      without pedaling. After 1 min of gases recording in resting conditions, the steady-state test&#xD;
      at FATmax intensity started and continued until min 60, the moment at which the test was&#xD;
      ended. Gases exchange and heart rate were continuously monitored. At time points 15', 30',&#xD;
      45', and 60', blood samples were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST SUBSTANCES: DIHYDROCAPSIATE AND PLACEBO:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators employed Capsiate Gold™ soft-gel capsules from Ajinomoto®. These capsules&#xD;
      consisted of 3 mg of purified DHC vehiculated with canola oil, modified corn starch,&#xD;
      vegetable glycerin, carrageenan, water, disodium hydrogen phosphate, and soy lecithin.&#xD;
      Hemicellulose powder was used as a placebo. Both DHC and hemicellulose were encapsulated by&#xD;
      independent manufacturers and put in different containers by an independent researcher (not&#xD;
      involved in the current study). Each container was labeled with a different code (0 or 1) so&#xD;
      that evaluators were not aware of the administered substance - therefore preventing bias. Of&#xD;
      note, both DHC and placebo capsules looked exactly similar to unable the identification of&#xD;
      the content by either researchers or participants.&#xD;
