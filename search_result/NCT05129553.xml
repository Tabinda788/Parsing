    <textblock>
      This is a Clinical Study Designed to Validate the Usability and Safety of the&#xD;
      Over-the-counter (OTC) Béa Applicator and Béa Cervical Cap Device in a Home Use Environment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female participants will undergo a baseline physical assessment performed by a physician at&#xD;
      the study site. The participants will then be given the Béa Applicator and Béa Cervical Cap&#xD;
      device with accompanying instructions and a semen collection pot. The participants will&#xD;
      return home to use the device as per the Instruction for Use (IFU). The Béa Cervical Cap will&#xD;
      remain in place for a minimum of 4 hours and a maximum of 6 hours. At the follow-up&#xD;
      assessment, the investigator will investigate all primary objectives via a physical exam or&#xD;
      via questioning the participant.&#xD;
