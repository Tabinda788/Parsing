      With all of the gains that have been achieved with endovascular mechanical thrombectomy&#xD;
      revascularization and intravenous thrombolysis logistics, there is still a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with salvageable brain tissue for whom persistent emergent large vessel occlusion&#xD;
      (ELVO) portends a catastrophic outcome. Study aims to test the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      emergent microsurgical intervention in acute ischemic stroke patients with symptomatic middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery occlusion after failure of mechanical thrombectomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      EMIAS is a prospective bi-center randomized case-control study. All consecutive AIS patients&#xD;
      with acute symptomatic occlusion of middle cerebral artery (in M1 or M2 segment) with or&#xD;
      without intracranial ICA occlusion who failed to reach recanalization using MT (with or&#xD;
      without IVT) will be included in the study at Comprehensive Stroke Center of the České&#xD;
      Budějovice Hospital and Comprehensive Stroke Center of the University Hospital Ostrava.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria: 1) age of ≥ 18 years; 2) indication for MT according to valid&#xD;
      guidelines22-24; 3) modified Rankin score (mRS) of ≤ 32 before stroke onset; 4) baseline&#xD;
      Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of ≥ 6; 5) MCA occlusion in M1 or M2 segment&#xD;
      with or without intracranial ICA occlusion; 6) estimated onset-to-skin cut time of ≤6 h or&#xD;
      core/penumbra mismatch in cases with wake-up stroke or stroke with unknown onset; and 7) MT&#xD;
      failure with TICI score of 0-1 declared by an interventional neuroradiologist and expectation&#xD;
      to achieve recanalization within 24 h from stroke onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: 1) indication for MT according to valid guidelines22-24; 2) thrombocyte&#xD;
      count of ≤ 100,000/µL; and 3) contraindication for general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients after MT failure at the first Comprehensive Stroke center (Center 1) were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to the microsurgery group (MSIG) or standard of care Control group 1 (CG1). No true&#xD;
      randomization was performed, allocation was done only according to surgeon availability&#xD;
      (surgeon present or in reach of site to start the procedure within 30 minutes). All&#xD;
      consecutive patients with standard stroke care and recanalization failure after MT without&#xD;
      any subsequent surgical interventions at the second Comprehensive Stroke center (Center 2)&#xD;
      were included in the Control group 2 (CG2) to support reproducibility and eliminate bias in&#xD;
      patient selection for MSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics (age, sex) and medical history (arterial hypertension; diabetes mellitus;&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia; body mass index; previous stroke or transient ischemic attack; ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease; atrial fibrillation; smoking; alcohol abuse; previous use of antithrombotics,&#xD;
      anticoagulants, and statins; glucose and cholesterol level at admission; and blood pressure&#xD;
      at admission) data will be collected in all patients at admission. The neurological status&#xD;
      will be assessed using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at&#xD;
      admission and 24 h and seven days after stroke onset. Collected data for clinical outcomes&#xD;
      include mRS 90 days after stroke onset, 7- and 90-day mortality, and incidence of symptomatic&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH). SICH is defined as type 2 parenchymal hematoma and clinical&#xD;
      worsening with an NIHSS score of ≥ 4. Favorable clinical outcome is defined as an mRS score&#xD;
      of 0-2 on day 90 after stroke onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVT and MT treatment Both Comprehensive Stroke centers have at least 15 years of experience&#xD;
      in acute stroke treatment with a high number of IVT (more than 100 per year) and MT (more&#xD;
      than 80 per year) cases complying with local or European stroke organization certification&#xD;
      regulations. The IVT and MT treatment protocols at both centers followed the current&#xD;
      recommendations by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, European&#xD;
      Stroke Organization, and/or national guidelines throughout the study duration. All patients&#xD;
      will be examined using computed tomography and computed tomography angiography at admission.&#xD;
      Patients with wake-up stroke or unknown stroke onset will be also examined using CT perfusion&#xD;
      mismatch scans or magnetic resonance diffusion weighted images/fluid-attenuated inversion&#xD;
      recovery mismatch to evaluate ischemic core and penumbra for treatment indication according&#xD;
      to the above-mentioned guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following stroke data and logistical information will be collected in all patients:&#xD;
      occlusion location, occlusion side, stroke etiology, early ischemic changes evaluated using&#xD;
      ASPECTS, onset-to-admission time, onset-to-needle time for IVT, onset-to-groin time for MT,&#xD;
      and final TICI score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MT failure declaration The MT procedure will be always indicated by a stroke physician and&#xD;
      performed by an experienced interventional neuroradiologist with expertise in cerebral vessel&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment techniques. MT recanalization success will be assessed using the&#xD;
      TICI scale. Cases with TICI scores of 0 and 1 are evaluated as recanalization failure.&#xD;
      Recanalization failure will be declared after at least three unsuccessful attempts to&#xD;
      retrieve the thrombi using a retrieval or aspiration tool, or after failure to reach the site&#xD;
      of occlusion using the guiding wire. The declaration of onset-to-failure time will be&#xD;
      assessed in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microsurgical intervention A protocol for emergent microsurgical treatment as a rescue&#xD;
      therapy for cases with mechanical thrombectomy failure as a third-tier option was established&#xD;
      and approved by the local ethical committee. The revascularization is always indicated by a&#xD;
      stroke physician after MT failure declaration by an interventional neuroradiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The request for MSI will reported to the surgeon immediately after encountering the first&#xD;
      difficulties in reaching the occlusion site or a failure to resolve vessel obturation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microsurgery technique and its prerequisites&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the microsurgical interventions will be performed by vascular neurosurgeon with&#xD;
      experience of more than 200 EC-IC bypasses. Surgical technique will be chosen according to&#xD;
      the classification of MT failure with the following scenarios:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EC-IC bypass distal to the occlusion will be prepared in A) patients with a failure to&#xD;
      pass the lesion using microwire and B) subjects with a failure to reach the occlusion. Middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery exploration and eventual embolectomy will performed before the bypass. A&#xD;
      transverse arteriotomy will be used in the M1 segment occlusion, while a longitudinal&#xD;
      arteriotomy with optional subsequent lesion retrieval using a Fogarty catheter will be used&#xD;
      in the upper or lower M2 trunk occlusions. The M2 with longitudinal arteriotomy can be used&#xD;
      as the recipient artery for a superior temporal artery to M2 artery anastomosis. Minimally&#xD;
      invasive and rapid surgical embolectomy technique will be used in cases with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation as the suspected source of emboli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) In cases with successful passage using a microwire or catheter, but with failure of&#xD;
      thrombus retrieval, a calcified cerebral embolus can be an example of failure. In cases with&#xD;
      suspected occlusion due to intracranial atherosclerosis, the superior temporal artery will be&#xD;
      always dissected and EC-IC bypass will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be administered by a dedicated anesthetist. Any hypotension episodes&#xD;
      will be carefully avoided after the introduction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrinogen levels will be checked at least 1 h after IVT administration to predict early&#xD;
      fibrinogen degradation coagulopathy and to decrease procedural and post procedural risk of&#xD;
      bleeding. Fibrinogen will be supplemented with Haemocomplettan P® (CSL Behring GmbH, Marburg,&#xD;
      Germany) in cases with levels of &lt; 1 g/L. The fibrinogen level will be checked again upon&#xD;
      skin closure and then the following day 24 h after IVT. In patients with no antiplatelet drug&#xD;
      history prior to stroke, 500 mg of an intravenous acetylsalicylic acid will be administered&#xD;
      during the revascularization procedure.&#xD;
