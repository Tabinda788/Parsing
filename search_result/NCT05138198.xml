  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized control trial (RCT) is to test the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of a lifestyle intervention with a focus on implementing a high dose Mediterranean Diet&#xD;
      protocol with physical activity to reduce systemic inflammation and body weight among WTC&#xD;
      first responders having overweight/obesity and PTSD. The findings of this study will&#xD;
      demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach to reduce comorbidities among similar&#xD;
      populations exposed to traumatic events; the findings will also inform the World Trade Center&#xD;
      Health Program's extensive research and clinical efforts with the potential to provide a&#xD;
      preventive care model to reduce systemic inflammation and related chronic disease among WTC&#xD;
      responders with PTSD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a lifestyle intervention,&#xD;
      including a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) with a physical activity (PA) component. The study&#xD;
      is a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) among WTC responders with PTSD who have overweight&#xD;
      and obesity. The 10-week intervention has two-arms, the intervention (MedDiet) with tips to&#xD;
      increase PA (n=30) and control (care as usual n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high dose and high fidelity intervention combines several previously tested intervention&#xD;
      modalities, including individual nutrition counseling, group cooking sessions, and&#xD;
      communication and education through smartphones, including motivational texts &amp; reminders,&#xD;
      videos, teach-back surveys, and goal setting. While the main goal of the intervention is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, the study will also assess&#xD;
      changes in the overall dietary intake, the MedDiet score, and PA of the intervention group&#xD;
      and between the two groups from baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the intervention group will experience a significant increase in the&#xD;
      MedDiet score and PA activity from baseline to post-intervention; compared to the control&#xD;
      group, the intervention group will achieve a significantly higher MedDiet score and will&#xD;
      engage in more PA after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in body weight, inflammatory biomarkers, and prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS)&#xD;
      in the intervention group and between the two groups from baseline to post-intervention will&#xD;
      be explored; whether changes in inflammatory biomarkers, are moderated by changes in MetS,&#xD;
      body weight, or MedDiet score will also be explored. The hypothesis is that the intervention&#xD;
      group will experience a significant decrease in inflammatory biomarkers and prevalence in&#xD;
      MetS from baseline to post-intervention; compared to the control group, the intervention&#xD;
      group will achieve a significantly higher decrease in these measures; the decline in&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers will be moderated by a reduction in the prevalence of MetS and/or&#xD;
      increase in MedDiet score.&#xD;

    <description>At the beginning of each week (1-10), members were sent a text message introducing the week and providing the link to the week's website. This website includes downloadable material for this group with recipes and other important nutrition information, as well as the weekly topic information and informative video. After receiving the link to the website, members received a Qualtrics survey with a teach-back question related to the video and a goal-setting question related to the topics of the week. At the end of each week, members received another Qualtrics survey with a question regarding the goal of the past week.&#xD;

    <description>As part of usual care, members attended one-on-one monthly counseling sessions with the assigned dietitian and reviewed their current eating habits and physical activity, as well as other environmental factors that may be affecting their weight such as work, home environment, sleeping issues, and medications. After reviewing current practices, the RD provided medical nutrition therapy (MNT), a specific application of the Nutrition Care Process in clinical settings that focuses on the management of diseases (e.g. diabetes, heart disease, etc.). Specific dietary recommendations are based on the Bull's Eye Food Guide, used by Stony Brook University Hospital for outpatient nutrition counseling. Individuals in the standard care received more individualized calorie recommendations (usual care) than the Mediterranean diet group.</description>
