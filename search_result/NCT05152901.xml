  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the relative bioavailability of inhaled epinephrine compared&#xD;
      with 0.3mg epinephrine administered IM in healthy male and female participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DMC-IH1 (Investigational Product) is a capsule containing epinephrine bitartrate dry powder&#xD;
      blend contained within a single-use, proprietary inhalation device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dosages for inhalation are 0.3 mg on Visit 2, 1.3 mg (dose will not exceed 6 mg)&#xD;
      on Visit 3, and 4 mg (dose will not exceed 6 mg) on Visit 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up. Total duration of the&#xD;
      study is approximately 66 days including -28 days from screening to visit to follow up&#xD;

         15. Participant has any clinically relevant respiratory (especially with reduction of&#xD;
             respiratory capacity) or cardiovascular abnormality (eg, high blood pressure,&#xD;
             myocardial infarction in previous 3 months, etc), or any other abnormality that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator may pose a safety risk to a participant in this study, may&#xD;
             confound the clinical performance or safety assessment, or may interfere with study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
