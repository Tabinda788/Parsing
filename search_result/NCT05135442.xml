  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in the first-line treatment of patients&#xD;
      with acquired TTP，we design this prospective, multi-center, single-arm interventional&#xD;
      study.All enrolled TTP patients were given bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 intravenous injection d1, 4,&#xD;
      8, on the basis of standard single membrane plasma exchange (2L/d) and hormone therapy&#xD;
      (1mg/kg prednisone or equivalent methylprednisolone). 11 (4 doses in total). Bortezomib&#xD;
      should be administered immediately after each plasma exchange, and the interval between the&#xD;
      next plasma exchange is&gt; 24h. Plasma exchange continued until the patient's platelet count&#xD;
      was &gt;100×109/L for 2 consecutive days, and then changed to once every other day for a total&#xD;
      of two times and then stopped.&#xD;
