  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to find out whether the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      is an effective treatment for advanced uterine carcinosarcoma. The researchers will also do&#xD;
      tests to find out whether biomarkers in the blood can predict the cancer's response to the&#xD;
      study treatment. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or&#xD;
      tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease. A&#xD;
      biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or&#xD;
      condition&#xD;

             lenvatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant hemoptysis or tumor bleeding within 2 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
