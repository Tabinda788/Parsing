    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, open-label, 2-cohort, fixed-sequence, DDI study in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects. Healthy volunteers will be administered multiple oral doses of ATI-2173 in&#xD;
      combination with midazolam or clarithromycin and assessed for safety and tolerability&#xD;
      including blood tests to show how the body metabolizes and eliminates the investigational&#xD;
      drug as well as how the investigational drug interacts with midazolam or clarithromycin.&#xD;
