  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of TTI-621 or TTI-622 in combination with daratumumab&#xD;
      hyaluronidase-fihj in people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The researchers look&#xD;
      for the highest dose of TTI-621 and TTI-622 that causes few or mild side effects in&#xD;
      participants when given in combination with daratumumab hyaluronidase-fihj. Once the&#xD;
      researchers find the highest safe dose of each study drug, they will further test the&#xD;
      combinations (TTI-621 + daratumumab hyaluronidase-fihj and TTI-622 + daratumumab&#xD;
      hyaluronidase-fihj) in new participants to find out if the combinations are effective in&#xD;
      treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Researchers think that combining TTI-621 or&#xD;
      TTI-622 with daratumumab hyaluronidase-fihj, a standard treatment for multiple myeloma, may&#xD;
      be an effective treatment approach.&#xD;

             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;

             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
