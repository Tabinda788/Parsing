  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To verify the correlation between the proposed artificial intelligence based bowel&#xD;
      preparation assessment system and the missed detection rate of adenomas, and to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the system can effectively assist doctors in identifying patients who need to be&#xD;
      re-examined by colonoscopy due to poor intestinal cleanliness.&#xD;

    <description>(≥ 5mm adenoma missed rate, ≥ 5mm AMR) : Each patient will receive two colonoscopy examinations. The ≥ 5mm adenoma that were not detected in the first colonoscopy was define as missed ≥ 5mm adenoma. Numerator is the number of missed detection of ≥5mm adenomas during colonoscopy, and denominator is the total number of ≥ 5mm adenomas receiving colonoscopy.</description>

    <description>During the examination, the endoscopic physician required to stay in place while rinsing, and the lens could only be withdrawn after rinsing.&#xD;
During the examination, the recorder should record the time points of the right colon, transverse colon, and left colon, as well as the time of irrigation.&#xD;
If both are considered to be properly, then second colonoscopy was performed immediately.&#xD;
If both results agree or either side agrees that the gut is not well prepared, the review will be carried out within a year</description>
