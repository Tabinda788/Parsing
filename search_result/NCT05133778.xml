      Background of the study: Polyphenols have been studied for their protective effect against&#xD;
      the development of ROS-related diseases like cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. The combined supplementation of pomegranate and&#xD;
      sweet orange polyphenols could be an effective strategy to improve exercise performance, due&#xD;
      to their antioxidant character and ability to stimulate NO production, to stimulate&#xD;
      mitochondrial biogenesis and to accelerate muscle repair and decrease muscle tissue damage.&#xD;
      The study aims to assess the effect of a combined supplementation of pomegranate and sweet&#xD;
      orange extract on exercise capacity, physical activity, muscle strength and quality of life&#xD;
      in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study: The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of 12-week&#xD;
      long daily administration of a sweet orange and pomegranate extract on exercise capacity in&#xD;
      healthy adults (40 - 65 y).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy, overweight, sedentary adults between 40 and 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 12-week supplementation with 650 mg sweet orange and pomegranate extract (2&#xD;
      capsules per day) compared to placebo (760 mg maltodextrin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome of the study: Change in aerobic capacity (VO2max), assessed with an&#xD;
      Ekblom-Bak submaximal cycling test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily physical activity as determined by accelerometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary intake as measured by a 3-day food record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handgrip strength&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle cell proliferation and differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis assessed in&#xD;
           skeletal muscle biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life as measured by the WHO-QOL-100 questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General health as measured by SF-36 questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitality as measured by the Dutch Vitality Questionnaire (Vita-16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiometabolic health biomarkers, cortisol, C-reactive protein determined with ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antioxidative capacity measured with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC)&#xD;
           assay&#xD;
