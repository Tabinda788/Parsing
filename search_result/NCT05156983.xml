  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the potential of PROTHROMPLEX TOTAL compared to&#xD;
      investigator-assigned four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) as a part of SOC&#xD;
      for the reversal of anticoagulation in participants treated with Factor Xa inhibitors who&#xD;
      require urgent surgery/invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be randomized to PROTHROMPLEX TOTAL or investigator-assigned 4F-PCC as a&#xD;
      part of SOC prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will need to be hospitalized. They will also be&#xD;
      contacted (via telehealth/remote monitoring) 30 days after the surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Percentage of participants with intraoperative effective hemostasis using Intraoperative Four Point Hemostatic Efficacy Scale that incorporates the surgeon's subjective opinion as to whether intraoperative hemostasis is sufficient and if there is the need for administration of non-study hemostatic treatments will be reported.</description>

    <time_frame>At the end of the surgery/procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with intraoperative effective hemostasis based on hemostatic efficacy rating algorithm will be reported. The hemostatic efficacy rating (composite) algorithm incorporates the difference between predicted and actual bleeding during surgery, the surgeon's subjective opinion as to whether intraoperative hemostasis is sufficient, and the need for administration of non-study hemostatic treatments.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 30 days after the end of the surgery/invasive procedure (up to 33 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (including a symptom or disease or an abnormal laboratory finding) in a participant or clinical investigation participants administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. TEAEs is defined as those with a start date on or after the first dose of study treatment, or with a start date before the date of first dose of study treatment but increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment. A SAE is any event that results in: death; life-threatening event; requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or a medically important event. AESI will include hypersensitivity reactions, events of disordered coagulation such as bleeding AESI, hypercoagulable AESI.</description>

    <description>Number of thrombotic events within 30 days after the end of the surgery/invasive procedure will be assessed. Thrombotic events occur when a blood clot, known as a thrombus, is formed within a blood vessel. It prevents blood from flowing normally through the circulatory system.</description>
