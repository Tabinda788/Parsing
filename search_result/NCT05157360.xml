    <masking_description>A randomization list will be used to show whether patients will be in group A or B. Only the Research Scientist who made the randomization list and the Pharmacy will know what group patients are in. The Burn Program Coordinator will get consent and enroll patients to the study. After that, the Burn Program Coordinator will call the pharmacy and report what group the patient is enrolled in, A or B. Then, the pharmacy will order the respective medications.&#xD;
The doctors and nurses providing care for the patients will not know who is in what treatment group, and neither will the patients.</masking_description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will be enrolled within 24 hours of diagnosis of sepsis related to a necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTI). HAT will be initiated within 4 hours of enrollment (thus treatment with HAT can occur no later than 28 hours from diagnosis).&#xD;
Per Dr. Marik's original study, HAT consists of:&#xD;
1.5 g vitamin C every 6 hours for 4 days or until ICU discharge&#xD;
50 mg hydrocortisone every 6 hours for 7 days or until ICU discharge (followed by a taper over 3 days)&#xD;
200 mg thiamine every 12 hours for 4 days or until ICU discharge In our study, due to the prolonged ICU course typical of most patients with NSTIs, it is not felt feasible to continue indefinitely &quot;until ICU discharge.&quot; Thus, treatment will be continued for 4 to 7 days plus a 3 day taper (respectively) as above, with no plan for a longer duration of treatment.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control Arm</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control arm will receive the same standard ICU care for NSTI but will not receive HAT. They will receive a placebo consisting of normal saline, indistinguishable to the treatment team (blinded) but known to the pharmacy team (unblinded to treatment and placebo groups). This is so that if the treatment team elects to give stress dose steroids, they can be administered without breaking protocol (i.e. if the patient is getting HAT, it includes steroids, so if the treating team wanted to start hydrocortisone - because they didn't know if the patient was on HAT or placebo and felt steroids were indicated - the pharmacist could ensure the patient was on steroids one way or another without unblinding the providers).</description>
