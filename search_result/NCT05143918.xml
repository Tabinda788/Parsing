      Hypothyroidism is an underactive thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism means that the thyroid gland&#xD;
      can't make enough thyroid hormone to keep the body running normally. People are hypothyroid&#xD;
      if they have too little thyroid hormone in the blood. Common causes are Iodine deficiency,&#xD;
      autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, surgical removal of the thyroid, and&#xD;
      radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three types of hypothyroidism: primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary&#xD;
      hypothyroidism results from a low level of thyroid hormone due to destruction of the thyroid&#xD;
      gland. This condition results in increased secretion and elevation of serum&#xD;
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. If the structure of the gland remains normal,&#xD;
      dysfunction can be caused by decreased TSH secretion from the pituitary; this Is called&#xD;
      secondary hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In tertiary hypothyroidism, a decrease in thyroid hormone arises from inadequate secretion of&#xD;
      thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. It is not always possible to&#xD;
      differentiate between secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism, and they are often collectively&#xD;
      referred to as central hypothyroidism. About 99%ofhypothyroidism cases are primary&#xD;
      hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothyroidism is common throughout the world. In iodine-sufficient countries, the prevalence&#xD;
      of hypothyroidism ranges from 1% to 2%. rising to 7% in individuals aged between 85 and 89&#xD;
      years. In the absence of age-specific reference ranges for TSH, an ageing population is&#xD;
      likely to result in a higher prevalence of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is approximately&#xD;
      ten times more prevalent in women than men10. the awareness of hypothyroidism has increased&#xD;
      gradually, as has rate of initiation of levothyroxine substitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms usually develop slowly and the patient may not realise to have a medical problem for&#xD;
      several years. Common symptoms include: tiredness, being sensitive to cold, weight gain,&#xD;
      constipation, depression, slow movements and thoughts, muscle aches and weakness, muscle&#xD;
      cramps, dry and scaly skin, brittle hair and nails, loss of libido (sex drive), pain,&#xD;
      numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome),irregular&#xD;
      periods or heavy periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is a subjective assessment of the effects of disease&#xD;
      and its treatment on the physical, social, psychological, and somatic dimensions of a&#xD;
      patient's life. Thus, HRQL is considered an important supplementary outcome measure in the&#xD;
      management of different conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid hormones are important for the body's total energy metabolism and the neuroendocrine&#xD;
      function. Hence, it seems apparent that a dysfunction of the thyroid hormone secretion should&#xD;
      have a major influence on the total capacity of the body, both physically and mentally.&#xD;
      Increasing attention is being paid to assessing HRQL among patients with thyroid disorders,&#xD;
      and previous studies have revealed that HRQL is frequently affected in patients with&#xD;
      hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to our knowledge, no previous study explored the quality of life and its correlates among&#xD;
      Egyptian hypothyroidism patients. The current study aims to assess the quality of life and&#xD;
      its predictor among hypothyroidism in Assiut University Hospital&#xD;
