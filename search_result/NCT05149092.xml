    <textblock>
      In this randomized, placebo controlled, double blind trial, effects of relatively high doses&#xD;
      of chicken protein hydrolysate (CPH) or casein hydrolysate (placebo) supplementation will be&#xD;
      investigate in healthy persons with abdominal obesity. The 12-week study examines potential&#xD;
      effects on body weight, abdominal obesity, body composition, plasma parameters of metabolic&#xD;
      health including lipids, inflammatory parameters, redox state and microbiota biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small peptides in the range of 2 - 12 amino acids are believed to cross the intestinal wall&#xD;
      undigested and enter the circulation where they can have a range of activities based on their&#xD;
      amino acid composition and structure. Natural peptides isolated from a number of food&#xD;
      proteins, including plants and marine organisms, are shown to have antioxidant effects in in&#xD;
      vitro tests, and anti-hypertensive effects in mice through inhibition of the&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE). Protein hydrolysates from both animal- and plant-based&#xD;
      sources will consist of a mixture of potentially bioactive peptides that can have specific&#xD;
      effects based on their composition. Studies have shown that egg- and soy-derived hydrolysates&#xD;
      have anti-diabetic and anti-obesity properties in rodents. Pre-clinical studies in mice have&#xD;
      demonstrated potent plasma cytokine lowering abilities and atherosclerosis-prevention by&#xD;
      chicken protein hydrolysate (CPH) diets, as well as effects on plasma cholesterol level,&#xD;
      cytokines and lipid metabolism, including mitochondrial function. In addition, an isolated&#xD;
      peptide fraction from chicken inhibits the dipeptyl peptidase IV, and thus has the potential&#xD;
      to restore glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hydrolysate supplements used in this study are obtained from rest raw materials (RRM)&#xD;
      from mechanical deboning of chicken meat (Food Grade, Nortura AS HÃ¦rland, Norway). Freshly&#xD;
      minced chicken RRM has been treated with enzymes optimized to generate bioactive&#xD;
      hydrolysates. The supplement is given in a dose of 18 g protein per day, corresponding to the&#xD;
      protein content of a standard meal, and similar to doses recommended in protein shake&#xD;
      supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 60 males and females age &gt;20 years with abdominal obesity participate, recruited&#xD;
      primarily through social media advertisements (Facebook) limited to a 12 km radius around the&#xD;
      city center of Bergen. Participants provided written informed consent, and were screened via&#xD;
      self-reporting in an online form in EasyTrial hosted by the Research Unit for Clinical Trials&#xD;
      at the University of Bergen. Data collection by the study staff at baseline verifies&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and participant eligibility prior to randomization. The&#xD;
      potential participants are informed about practical details at a digital or physical meeting&#xD;
      1-2 weeks prior to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups of participants (40-60% males/females) are block randomized to the two treatments (CPH&#xD;
      or placebo casein supplementation) using randomly selected block sizes, and stratified&#xD;
      according to sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are given a container with the powder sufficient for the entire 12-week&#xD;
      study period, and a spoon to measure the intake at breakfast (6 g), lunch (6 g) and supper (6&#xD;
      g), or morning (9 g) and evening (9 g) according to individual preference. The patients will&#xD;
      mix the powder products in water or mineral water.&#xD;
