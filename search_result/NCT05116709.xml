      The study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: single drug dose escalation study. Accelerated titration and &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation&#xD;
      rule were used to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of&#xD;
      BAT6005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the clinical benefit of a single agent may be limited, the study used accelerated&#xD;
      titration and the &quot;3+3&quot; dose-escalation rule to explore the safe dose range from the ethical&#xD;
      point of view of exposing fewer subjects to ineffective doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six dose groups were set up, including 10mg (initial dose) group, 30mg group, 100mg group,&#xD;
      300mg group, 600mg group and 900mg group, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole is divided into two phases. The first stage: 10mg group, 30mg group, 100mg group&#xD;
      using accelerated titration method to increase the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage: 300mg group, 600mg group, 900mg group according to the standard &quot;3+3&quot; rule&#xD;
      dose increase study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group/Increasing Method Dose group (mg) Number of fixed dose cases (person) A/ Accelerated&#xD;
      titration 10 1, or 3~6 B/ Accelerated titration 30 1, or 3~6 C/ accelerated titration 100 1,&#xD;
      or 3~6 D/ Standard 3+3 300 3 to 6 E/ Standard 3+3 600 3 to 6 F/ Standard 3+3 900 3 to 6 Note:&#xD;
      After the dose-increasing study is completed, it can be considered as appropriate after&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of safety and other factors, or a new dose can be selected between&#xD;
      the dose that stops climbing and the previous lower dose group according to the above rules&#xD;
      to determine the more accurate maximum tolerated dose according to the specific situation and&#xD;
      the discussion with the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation rules are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 3 dose groups A, B and C, accelerated titration was used in dose-increasing&#xD;
      scheme, i.e. cohort size =1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, 1 subject in group A was included. If no grade ≥2 toxicity was observed related to the&#xD;
      study drug (except for simple laboratory abnormalities that the investigator judged to be&#xD;
      asymptomatic and without intervention), the subject could be directly transferred to group B&#xD;
      for dose escalation, which was accelerated to group C by the rule (&quot; 1+1 &quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accelerated titration dose increase should be discontinued once a class 2 or greater&#xD;
      toxicity associated with the drug under study is observed in one group (except for simple&#xD;
      laboratory abnormalities that the investigator judged to be asymptomatic and without&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 2 subjects in the dose group will be transferred to the standard &quot;3+3&quot; dose&#xD;
      escalation (i.e. cohort size =3) mode until MTD or MAD is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from group D, the dose increasing mode was adjusted to the standard &quot;3+3&quot; rule, as&#xD;
      shown in the following table:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT population/current dose group population dose increase or decrease decision appears 0/3 3&#xD;
      new subjects received the next high-dose group 1/3 of the current dose group followed by 3&#xD;
      new subjects 1/3 and 0/3 new subjects received the next high-dose group&#xD;
&#xD;
      ≥2/3 or ≥2/6 indicates that the dose has exceeded MTD and should be stopped. If there are 6&#xD;
      people in the former dose group, the former lower dose group is used as MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are only 3 people in the previous dose group, add 3 people to the previous dose&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the addition of 3 persons, MTD continued to be down-regulated if there were ≥2 DLT in&#xD;
      the previous dose group If MTD is found, the sponsor may select a dose of MTD or lower as the&#xD;
      recommended dose for phase II clinical studies after discussion with the investigator based&#xD;
      on the specific situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If MTD is not reached, the sponsor may select a dose of MAD or one of the following dose&#xD;
      groups as the recommended dose for phase II clinical studies, depending on the specific&#xD;
      situation and discussion with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study progresses, protocols may be allowed to revise the definition of DLT as&#xD;
      appropriate in light of new clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events that meet DLT criteria occurring outside the DLT evaluation period or other&#xD;
      adverse safety information that the investigator considers meaningful do not directly&#xD;
      influence dose-escalation decisions, but should be taken into account in the final&#xD;
      determination of THE RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each dose increase, the sponsor and investigator will discuss and comprehensively&#xD;
      evaluate the decision to increase or decrease the dose, using available information on&#xD;
      safety, PK (if any), and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to inclusion in the next dose team, all subjects in the previous dose group must&#xD;
      complete 21 days of DLT observation before toleration is explored according to the standard&#xD;
      &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dose-escalation studies, the first subject in the same dose group may be included in the&#xD;
      next subject 1 week after the first dose observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each dose group, a minimum of 24 hours should be allowed between the administration of&#xD;
      the prior subject and the administration of subsequent subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reduction adjustments are not allowed; The dose of BAT6005 should be upregulated as&#xD;
      appropriate, but with extreme caution, at least simultaneously: ① Subjects have received at&#xD;
      least 4 cycles of study medication; ② After discussion between the sponsor and the study, it&#xD;
      was concluded that the subjects receiving the higher primary dose group might bring more&#xD;
      clinical benefits than the current dose group;&#xD;
&#xD;
      ③ The higher dose group has been shown to fail to reach MTD by subsequent dose escalation&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part TWO: dose extension study. According to the preliminary safety and efficacy results of&#xD;
      the dose-escalation study, the investigator discussed with the sponsor to select the&#xD;
      appropriate dose and tumor species for the extended study, so as to further study the safety&#xD;
      and clinical efficacy of BAT6005 single drug, providing a basis for subsequent clinical&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1~2 dose cohort studies were planned, with no less than 6 patients in each dose cohort, and&#xD;
      PK study was carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study period can be roughly divided into screening period, treatment period and&#xD;
      follow-up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period: -28d~0d, that is, after the informed consent is signed, the screening&#xD;
      evaluation can be completed within 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period: Every 3 weeks is one administration cycle, the study drug is given on the&#xD;
      first day of each cycle, starting from the second cycle, the time window of administration&#xD;
      can be ±3 days, but in addition to imaging examination, subjects must complete vital signs,&#xD;
      laboratory examination, physical status score and other tests within 3 days before each&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be required to complete clinical tumor radiographic evaluations&#xD;
      (consistent, CT or MRI) every 6 weeks (±7 days) during the first 24 weeks after initial&#xD;
      dosing, and every 9 weeks (±7 days) thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug therapy should continue until the onset of disease progression, withdrawal due to&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, acceptance of new antitumor therapy due to lack of therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit, withdrawal of informed consent and voluntary withdrawal for other reasons, or a&#xD;
      maximum of 17 cycles (approximately 1 year), whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DLT evaluation period was defined as the first treatment cycle, from initial dosing to 21&#xD;
      days after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Period: If subjects discontinue study drug Therapy, EOT will be considered as the&#xD;
      End of Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects, including those who have discontinued treatment for any reason (except loss of&#xD;
      follow-up, death, withdrawal of informed consent), will be scheduled for an EOT visit within&#xD;
      21+7 days of receiving their last study drug or prior to receiving subsequent new antitumor&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EOT visits should include vital signs, physical examination, laboratory examination, and&#xD;
      clinical tumor imaging evaluation (CT or MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the last dose of the study drug, subjects were required to be followed up for&#xD;
      safety, including immune-related adverse events (irAE), at 21+7, 60 (±7) days, and 90 (±7)&#xD;
      days until 90 (±7) days or after receiving new antitumor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety visits should be conducted at the study center, where vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examination, laboratory examination and other examinations should be performed to evaluate&#xD;
      AE, concomitant medication and concomitant treatment until the adverse reactions related to&#xD;
      the study drug disappear (or reduce to ≤1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If adverse reactions persist after discontinuation of treatment, the investigator has the&#xD;
      discretion to determine the frequency of follow-up based on clinical practice until the&#xD;
      investigator believes that the adverse reactions will return to normal, stabilize at an&#xD;
      acceptable level, or show no further improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up for survival: After the safe follow-up, the subjects were followed up once every 12&#xD;
      weeks (±14 days) by telephone until death, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent&#xD;
      or termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longest treatment time of the drugs studied in this project is about 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no disease progression or intolerance of toxicity after 1 year of initial study&#xD;
      use, subjects may return to the study facility for continued use by the investigator.&#xD;
