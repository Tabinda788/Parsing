  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wheat is the most important staple food consumed in the Western world and provides beneficial&#xD;
      health effects and functional properties. Nevertheless, an increasing proportion of the&#xD;
      general population is avoiding or reducing its consumption of wheat products due to&#xD;
      self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as patients with non-coeliac wheat&#xD;
      sensitivity (NCWS) and/or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      the amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), accounting for up to 15% of wheat proteins, play a&#xD;
      role in the symptom generation in NCWS and IBS. In vitro studies showed ATIs can induce an&#xD;
      innate immune response via direct interaction with the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),&#xD;
      activating the TLR4-MD2-CD14 complex with subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
      These results were confirmed in mice. Furthermore, in mice ATIs triggered intestinal&#xD;
      epithelial lymphocytosis and barrier dysfunction, and modified microbiota composition and&#xD;
      metabolism. Thus far, there have been no placebo-controlled studies investigating these&#xD;
      effects of isolated ATIs in human subjects. Understanding the role of ATIs in symptom&#xD;
      generation in NCWS and IBS patients is important to provide these patients with appropriate&#xD;
      dietary advice, improving their quality of life and decreasing their risk of nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to perform a proof-of-concept study to assess the effect of ATIs on the&#xD;
      intestinal barrier and immune function in healthy volunteers. The investigators hypothesise&#xD;
      that the ATIs either directly affect the intestinal barrier function, or indirectly by&#xD;
      activating an immune response via TLR4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study conforms a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, using&#xD;
      healthy human volunteers (male and female), 18-65 years old. Volunteers will each undergo two&#xD;
      test days, separated by a wash-out period of at least 4 weeks. At the test day, volunteers&#xD;
      receive either isolated ATIs or placebo (physiological saline), ingested using a nasogastric&#xD;
      intraduodenal feeding catheter.&#xD;
