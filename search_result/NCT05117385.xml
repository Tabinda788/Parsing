  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the capacity of botanical extracts to modulate immune mechanisms&#xD;
      compared to a placebo group in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this ex-vivo pilot study, healthy volunteers will consume extracts during 28 days and&#xD;
      blood will be sampled at baseline and end of study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the ex vivo immune responses with and without stimulation after consumption of botanical&#xD;
      extracts and identify the main mechanisms involved. The effect of the consumption of 4&#xD;
      botanical extracts on the quality of life in healthy adults compared to placebo will be also&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
