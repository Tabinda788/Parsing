  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In high-volume trauma centers, multi-slice CT scanners have become the routine imaging&#xD;
      modality for screening trauma patients due to their speed and accuracy. In trauma patients&#xD;
      with no known neurologic deficits, diagnostic CT is often obtained though it remains unclear&#xD;
      whether this affects management of the patient [1]. With the growing cost of health care, a&#xD;
      careful look at the benefit and cost of CT is needed to determine how to best utilize this&#xD;
      modality in the evaluation of trauma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: In trauma patients with absence of neurologic defects, the addition of&#xD;
      comprehensive CT does not change overall clinical management.&#xD;

      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the benefit of the CT scan in&#xD;
      the clinical management or outcomes of the trauma patients with no neurologic deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Percentage of trauma patients with no known neurologic deficits who&#xD;
      underwent a CT, any clinically impactful CT findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome: Percentage of benefits CT provides in clinical features, clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, injury severity score, GCS, age, sex, ethnicity, cause of injury, mechanism of&#xD;
      injury, hospital length of stay, operative vs. non-operative, discharge disposition,&#xD;
      radilogy, pathology results and images, any additional morbidities, total cost, 30-day&#xD;
      readmission rate, and morality. And when operation does occur, the types of operation and the&#xD;
      resulting cost and length of stay.&#xD;
