  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial using telemedicine as an intervention twice in the first 6 hours of&#xD;
      life to assess neonatal encephalopathy, one of the key factors involved in the decision to&#xD;
      treat a neonate with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). The investigators aim to enroll up to 150&#xD;
      neonates, anticipating that there will be about 100 neonates, who do not demonstrate moderate&#xD;
      to severe neonatal encephalopathy, and therefore do not meet criteria for treatment with TH.&#xD;
      The investigators will prospectively follow the clinical course of all 150 neonates through&#xD;
      monitoring with electroencephalogram (EEG) for up to 24 hours after birth to determine if&#xD;
      seizures are present and by MRI of the brain prior to hospital discharge to determine if&#xD;
      there is evidence of brain injury. Neonates will be enrolled in the study for the duration of&#xD;
      their hospital admission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal encephalopathy is a clinically defined condition of disturbed neurological function&#xD;
      in an infant of greater than 35 weeks gestation. Neonatal encephalopathy is most likely to&#xD;
      occur following a traumatic birth that requires some degree of neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;
      Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the standard-of-care neuroprotective therapy employed for&#xD;
      neonates who have symptoms of moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy. Assessment of&#xD;
      neonatal encephalopathy can be challenging because the symptoms can fluctuate and because&#xD;
      there is time pressure to decide to initiate TH before the neonate is 6 hours old, after&#xD;
      which TH has almost no beneficial effect. Doctors struggle with the decision to treat&#xD;
      neonates with milder symptoms and these neonates are at risk for two possible adverse&#xD;
      outcomes; 1) an eligible neonate is not recognized and therefore not treated with TH or 2) an&#xD;
      ineligible neonate may receive unnecessary treatment. The first error is one that can result&#xD;
      in lifelong impairments such as learning delays, epilepsy and cerebral palsy for the&#xD;
      untreated child and the second error, of unnecessary treatment is costly, invasive and not&#xD;
      without risk of associated issues with morphine exposure, cold-induced injury to the skin or&#xD;
      complications from venous access such as infection or blood clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Maine, the investigators have successfully implemented telemedicine both in the tertiary&#xD;
      care center and in the rural community hospital to permit visual evaluation of neonates and&#xD;
      inform joint decision making in these challenging instances. Telemedicine provides the&#xD;
      opportunity to have synchronous, unscheduled immediate expert consultation for neonatologists&#xD;
      with pediatric neurology in the tertiary care center and for primary care physicians with&#xD;
      both specialists in the community hospital setting. The objective of the present study is to&#xD;
      develop the telemedicine consultative network to continue to improve patient selection for&#xD;
      TH. The investigators aim to use telemedicine consults in three tertiary care centers (Maine&#xD;
      Medical Center, Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center and the University of Vermont&#xD;
      Medical Center) to develop evidence for the threshold at which neonates can be safely&#xD;
      excluded from TH treatment. In Aim 1, the investigators will assess neonates with milder&#xD;
      symptoms at least twice in the first 6 hours of life and for those not meeting criteria for&#xD;
      moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy, perform electroencephalogram (EEG) to rule out&#xD;
      seizures and MRI of the brain to rule out injury. In aim 2, the investigators will compare&#xD;
      the interrater reliability between the neonatologist neonatal encephalopathy exam and the one&#xD;
      performed via telemedicine by the pediatric neurologist.&#xD;
