      The investigators will implement a 2-arm online pragmatic feasibility randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) of E-ROD (final digital intervention name is pending but will be referred to here&#xD;
      as E-ROD - &quot;Empowered Relief: On-Demand&quot;) to reduce pain-specific distress, opioid craving,&#xD;
      and opioid misuse. They will compare E-ROD to an interactive digital health education (HE)&#xD;
      intervention in community-based individuals with comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse&#xD;
      (N=220). Completion of the brief post-treatment survey is a binary measure of treatment&#xD;
      engagement; treatment feasibility and appraisal are assessed with three items (satisfaction,&#xD;
      perceived utility, and likelihood to use skills learned). Electronic surveys will measure&#xD;
      opioid misuse behaviors, craving, and use; and pain intensity and psychological status at:&#xD;
      baseline, immediately post-treatment; at post-treatment weeks 1 and 2; and months 1, 2, and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most people who misuse prescription opioids report doing so for pain relief. This study will&#xD;
      investigate a digital intervention for people with comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention, tentatively entitled &quot;Empowered Relief: On-Demand&quot; (E-ROD), will include&#xD;
      roughly 60 minutes of interactive digital pain education and pain management skills content&#xD;
      with multimedia features. The investigators will conduct a fully online RCT of E-ROD in a&#xD;
      national sample of people with comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will implement a 2-arm online feasibility RCT of E-ROD to reduce&#xD;
      pain-specific distress, opioid craving, and opioid misuse. They will compare E-ROD to an&#xD;
      interactive digital health education (HE) intervention in community-based individuals with&#xD;
      comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse (N=220). Completion of the brief post-treatment&#xD;
      survey is a binary measure of treatment engagement; treatment feasibility and appraisal are&#xD;
      assessed with three items (satisfaction, perceived utility, and likelihood to use skills&#xD;
      learned). Electronic surveys will measure opioid misuse behaviors, craving, and use; and pain&#xD;
      intensity and psychological status at: baseline, immediately post-treatment; at&#xD;
      post-treatment weeks 1 and 2; and months 1, 2, and 3.&#xD;
