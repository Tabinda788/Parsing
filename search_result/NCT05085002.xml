  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      lerociclib in combination with standard endocrine therapy in female or male participants with&#xD;
      HR+/HER2- MBC. The study population will consist of either newly diagnosed, treatment naïve&#xD;
      participants with HR+/HER2- MBC (1L population) and participants with HR+/HER2- MBC who have&#xD;
      already progressed on first line endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen, anastrozole, or&#xD;
      letrozole (2L population). All premenopausal or perimenopausal female participants, and all&#xD;
      male participants, must be receiving goserelin for at least 28 days prior to entering the&#xD;
      study and will remain on goserelin throughout the study, in accordance with the prescribing&#xD;
      information and according to the study site's standard practice.&#xD;
