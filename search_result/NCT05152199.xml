  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rigid cystoscopy is a common procedure to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms in females.&#xD;
      This procedure can be done with or without an instrument called a sheath obturator. Both&#xD;
      techniques are used by surgeons and are considered safe, but have never been studied to see&#xD;
      if one technique leads to less discomfort with the patient's first void after the procedure.&#xD;
      The obturator's use may potentially reduce urethral irritation and bothersome postprocedural&#xD;
      symptoms, primarily dysuria. The investigators aim to determine whether there is a difference&#xD;
      in dysuria outcomes postoperatively when cystoscopy is performed with or without an&#xD;
      obturator.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rigid cystoscopy is a common procedure to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms in females.&#xD;
      This procedure can be done with or without an instrument called a sheath obturator (or&#xD;
      obturator for short). There are two acceptable insertion techniques for performing cystoscopy&#xD;
      in women. Surgeons can perform cystoscope without the use of the obturator by using a&#xD;
      &quot;visual&quot; technique where a telescope with a sheath is inserted for entry into the bladder&#xD;
      (referred to as cystoscopy without the obturator). Surgeons can also perform cystoscopy by&#xD;
      using an obturator with a sheath allowing for smooth entry without needing the telescope&#xD;
      (referred to as cystoscopy with the obturator). Both techniques are used by surgeons and are&#xD;
      considered safe, but have never been studied to see if one technique leads to less discomfort&#xD;
      with the patient's first void after the procedure. The obturator's use may potentially reduce&#xD;
      urethral irritation and bothersome postprocedural symptoms, primarily dysuria. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine whether there is a difference in dysuria outcomes&#xD;
      postoperatively when cystoscopy is performed with or without an obturator.&#xD;
