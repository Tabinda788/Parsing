  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to optimize patient outcomes and treatment intervention using a&#xD;
      robotic exoskeleton in adults with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA, stroke) by investigating&#xD;
      the following: AIM 1 is to investigate the effect of backward gait training with exoskeleton&#xD;
      on motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2 is to investigate the effect of backward gait training with exoskeleton on depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3 is to investigate the impact of social determinants of health and depression on patient&#xD;
      adherence to physical therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on previous findings on backward gait training as well as the use of a wearable robotic&#xD;
      exoskeleton in forward gait training, we hypothesize that backward gait training using&#xD;
      exoskeleton leads to greater improvements in functional mobility, neuromuscular control and&#xD;
      balance (AIM 1) and depression (AIM 2) in patients with stroke, when compared to standard of&#xD;
      care, which includes forward gait training using exoskeleton. Findings from AIM 1 and 2 will&#xD;
      provide novel evidence on the effects of backward gait training with exoskeleton in people&#xD;
      with stroke and serve as a foundation for optimizing physical therapy protocols to improve&#xD;
      motor functions and mental health. AIM 3 investigates the impact of social determinants of&#xD;
      health and depression on patient adherence to physical therapy. Patient adherence (also&#xD;
      called compliance) refers to the degree to which patients follow treatment recommendations&#xD;
      prescribed by their health care provider.34 Even though patient adherence leads to positive&#xD;
      treatment outcomes,35,36 it is affected by many factors, including patients' understanding of&#xD;
      their disease and associated treatment (i.e., health literacy), social support, and&#xD;
      depression.36-38 This experimental study employs a repeated measures design with participants&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either a Standard Care with Ekso Group (SCG; control group, n=31) or a&#xD;
      Standard Care with Ekso and Backward Walking Group (SCBWG; experimental group, n=31) in AIMs&#xD;
      1 and 2. AIMs 1 and 2 will be achieved using the group assignment as independent variables&#xD;
      and motor function and depression as dependent variables. AIM 3 will be achieved using social&#xD;
      determinants of health and depression as independent variables and patient adherence to&#xD;
      physical therapy as an independent variable.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to physical therapy is defined as â‰¥ 80% attendance to weekly physical therapy as recorded in the Data Collection Sheet. Based on the definition, patient adherence will be considered a dichotomous variable (yes/no) and will be used to test the association between health literacy and patient adherence.</description>

    <measure>Level of health literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Level of health literacy is measured by Newest Vital Sign. The Newest Vital Sign is a 6-question screening tool that identifies participants' risk of low or limited health literacy (HL) based on interpreting an ice cream nutrition label, available from Pfizer Pharmaceutical Company. The score ranges 0-6. A score of 0-1 suggests a high likelihood of limited literacy, a score of 2-3 indicates the possibility of limited literacy, and a score of 4-6 almost always indicates adequate literacy.</description>

    <description>Level of perceived social support is measured by Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. It is a self-administered scale, and the score ranges from 12 to 84. A score of 12-35 suggests a low perceived social support, a score of 36-60 suggests a medium social support, and a score of 61-84 suggests a high social support.</description>
