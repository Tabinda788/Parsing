    <textblock>
      Errors during a stressful pediatric critical situation occur more frequently than thought.&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to quantify the number and the type of errors made by pediatric&#xD;
      paramedical teams during the management of vital emergencies (medication dosage calculation,&#xD;
      compliance with algorithms for management of cardiac arrest…). Then, simulations with and&#xD;
      without the EasyPédia software will be compared during a high-fidelity simulation of a&#xD;
      standardized pediatric cardiac arrest scenario in order to evaluate its impact on reducing&#xD;
      errors during the management of a resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a single-center and observational trial in the pediatric intensive care&#xD;
      unit of the Besançon University Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study is divided in two parts :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 : non-interventional study Part with children in vital distress enrollment. Fifteen&#xD;
      patients will be recruited over a period of 1 year in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 : high-fidelity simulation tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part at a simulation platform with assessment of the EasyPedia software. Sixty health care&#xD;
      givers divided in 2 groups, experts (intensive care units and specialist mobile emergency&#xD;
      units) and non experts (pediatric medicine and pediatric emergencies units) in vital distress&#xD;
      care, will be included over a period of 4 months. They will be submitted to two simulation&#xD;
      scenarios : with and without the EasyPedia software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part follows a case-only observational study model and the second part follows a&#xD;
      case-crossover one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the time perspective, the first part is a cross-sectional study and the second&#xD;
      part is prospective.&#xD;
