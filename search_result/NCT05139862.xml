  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heartbeat is controlled by the brain and is regular but flexible to change in response to&#xD;
      environmental and internal stimuli. This feature is known as heart rate variability (HRV).&#xD;
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with diminished HRV and this is a&#xD;
      reflection of abnormal brain function caused by MDD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment that stimulates specific areas of the brain. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to test the hypothesis that rTMS induces changes in connectivity between the&#xD;
      area of the brain stimulated with rTMS and deeper areas in the brain associated to heart rate&#xD;
      regulation. 110 patients with TRD will be recruited and will undergo a concurrent TMS-fMRI&#xD;
      session before receiving a course of iTBS to the L-DLPFC for 30 sessions at 120% rMT.&#xD;
