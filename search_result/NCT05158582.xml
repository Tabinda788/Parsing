    <textblock>
      Racketlon is a combination sport in which competitors play a sequence of the four most&#xD;
      popular racket sports: Table Tennis, Badminton, squash and tennis. Squash (racquet sport) is&#xD;
      an intermittent high-intensity competitive racquet sport that requires quick movements as&#xD;
      maintaining control over the placement of the ball with the greatest spatial awareness that&#xD;
      is played globally through racquet sports are enjoyed throughout the world and are increasing&#xD;
      in their popularity. Since this game encumbers a high level of fitness from the players, who&#xD;
      are usually active for the majority of the playing time. Squash players are physically&#xD;
      challenged as they are engaged in continuous repetitive training and frequent participation&#xD;
      in game to improve their fitness and skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the effects of modified exercise program on LBP in&#xD;
      racketlon players. The modified exercise program is a 5-Week Linear Periodization Program,&#xD;
      which had effects on Maximal Strength and Speed on elite squash players. This study will find&#xD;
      whether this 5-week linear periodization program has an effect to prevent low back pain in&#xD;
      racketlon players.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Micheli functional scale (MFS):</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Micheli functional scale (MFS) was developed as a back-specific tool for functional assessment in young athletes. This scale is a brief and reliable rating scale to quantify pain intensity and athletic function and determines the degree of the back pain associated with sports activity limitations, back extension/or upright activities, sitting/or flexion activities, and jumping activity. The MFS is a self-report questionnaire and contains 5 items consisting of a symptom question, 3 activity-related questions, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain intensity. The total score is calculated by adding questionnaire responses (range 0 - 15) plus VAS score (range 0 - 10). This maximum total score of 25 is then multiplied by 4. The range of total scores is from 0 (least amount of difficulty) to 100 (the most amount of difficulty).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>1 Minute Push-up Test (PUT):</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The test began with the athlete in a push-up position, hands placed shoulder width apart with elbows in full extension. The athlete was asked to maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement. A 4-inch block was positioned directly below the athletes' chests to standardize push up depth every time. 1 repetition was counted when the athlete performs a push up and the chest comes into contact with the block and then returning to the starting position. Each athlete was given 1 minute to perform a maximum number of repetitions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kraus -Weber Test for lower back muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kraus-Weber Test involves a series of tests that measure minimum strength &amp; flexibility of the back, abdominals, psoas, and hamstring muscles. The Kraus-Weber fitness test protocols, a series of six medical fitness tests measuring the strength and flexibility of key postural (core) muscles. This abdominal test assesses the strength of the abdominal and psoas muscles.</description>
