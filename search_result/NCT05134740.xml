  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have previously used this sort of therapy to treat Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma that is associated with the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (&quot;mono&quot; or&#xD;
      the &quot;kissing disease&quot;), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found in cancer cells of up to half&#xD;
      of all patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This suggests that it may play a&#xD;
      role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's&#xD;
      immune system and escape being killed. Investigators previously tested special white blood&#xD;
      cells (cells that help the body fight disease and infection), called T cells. The T cells&#xD;
      were trained to kill EBV-infected cells and were tested to see whether treatment with these&#xD;
      cells could affect these tumors. In many patients investigators found that giving these&#xD;
      trained T cells caused a complete or partial response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many patients do not have EBV found in their lymphoma cells. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigators now want to test whether special T lymphocytes directed against other types of&#xD;
      proteins that show on the tumor cell surface can result in similar promising results. The&#xD;
      proteins that will be targeted in this study are called tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) -&#xD;
      these are cell proteins that are specific to the cancer cell, so they either do not show or&#xD;
      show up in low quantities on normal human cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this stage of the study, investigators will target five TAAs which commonly show on&#xD;
      lymphoma cells , called NY-ESO-1, MAGEA4, PRAME, Survivin and SSX. Investigators will do this&#xD;
      by using special types of T cells called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated in the lab.&#xD;
      These TM-specific T cells are an investigational product not yet approved by the U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this stage of the study is to find out if TM-specific cytotoxic T cells are&#xD;
      safe in children. Investigators want to learn what the side-effects are, and to see whether&#xD;
      this therapy might help treat patients with Hodgkin disease or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, patients provide blood for us to make TAA-specific cytotoxic T cells in the lab. The&#xD;
      amount of blood to be drawn will be less based on the child's weight per blood draw (3&#xD;
      mL/kg). Under certain conditions related to the patient's health, investigators may need to&#xD;
      collect the blood using a process called apheresis. Apheresis is the process where blood is&#xD;
      passed through a machine that separates out the components of the patient's blood that is&#xD;
      needed. The remainder of the patient's blood is then returned to the patient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the TAA-specific cytotoxic T cells can be made, the time from collection of the blood to&#xD;
      manufacture of T cells for administration to the patient is about 1 to 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells will then be injected by IV into the patient over 10 minutes. The patient may be&#xD;
      pre-treated with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Acetaminophen&#xD;
      (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are given to prevent a possible allergic reaction to&#xD;
      the T cell administration. Initially, two doses of T cells will be given two weeks apart. The&#xD;
      patient's lymphoma will be assessed before the infusion (pre-infusion) and then 6 weeks after&#xD;
      the second infusion. If after the second infusion there is a reduction in the size of the&#xD;
      patient's lymphoma on CT or MRI scan as assessed by a radiologist, the patient can receive up&#xD;
      to six (6) additional doses of the T cells at 6-8 week intervals. All of the treatments will&#xD;
      be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children 's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In between the first and second T cell infusions and for 6 weeks after the last infusion,&#xD;
      investigators ask that the patient not receive any other anti-cancer treatments such as&#xD;
      radiation therapy or chemotherapy. If the patient does receive any other therapies in-between&#xD;
      the first and second infusion of T cells, they will be taken off treatment and will not be&#xD;
      able to receive the second infusion of T cells .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL TESTS BEFORE TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated,the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the patient's tumor by routine imaging studies. Investigators will use&#xD;
           the imaging study that was used before to follow the tumor: CT, MRI, or PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test if the patient is a female who can have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL TESTS AFTER TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Imaging study 8 weeks after the 2nd TAA-CTL infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body , an extra 20-40 ml&#xD;
      (4-8 teaspoons) of blood or 3ml/kg of body weight of blood (whichever is less) will be taken&#xD;
      before the infusion, and at weeks 2, 4 and 8. Afterwards, blood will be collected at 3, 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months after the last infusion. The blood may be drawn from the patient's central line&#xD;
      at the time of his or her regular blood tests. Investigators will use this blood to see how&#xD;
      long the T cells last, and to look at the patient's immune response to their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient receives additional doses of T cells this blood will also be collected before&#xD;
      each infusion and 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks post each infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum amount of blood that may be drawn over the course of the study is 156 to 312&#xD;
      teaspoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators may request a sample of a previous tumor biopsy the patient has had or from a&#xD;
      tumor biopsy performed at any time while the patient is on this study. The sample will be&#xD;
      used for research purposes related to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of death, investigators will request permission to perform an autopsy to learn&#xD;
      more about the effects of the treatment on the patient's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION The patient's active participation in this study will last for approximately&#xD;
      one 1 year. If they receive additional doses of the T cells as described above, their active&#xD;
      participation will last until one 1 year after their last dose of T cells. Investigators will&#xD;
      then contact them once a year for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) in&#xD;
      order to evaluate their disease response long-term.&#xD;
