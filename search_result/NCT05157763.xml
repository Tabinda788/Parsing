      This study will be a multicenter, prospective, open label, one-arm study intended to assess&#xD;
      the Safety and Efficacy of EscharEx (EX-02) in the treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with one primary superficial or nodular basal cell carcinoma lesion with a&#xD;
      diameter of 5-10mm (Histologically confirmed BCC) located on the trunk or upper extremities&#xD;
      (not including the hands), with well-defined borders and no previous radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      32 patients are planned to be enrolled into the study from 2-4 US sites. This study will be&#xD;
      an Open-Label Study where all patients will be treated with the investigational product&#xD;
      EX-02.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be conducted in 2 stages. In the first stage, a group of sixteen (16)&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and treated as detailed below for group 1. Safety results from the&#xD;
      first group of patients will be evaluated by the sponsor and by the DSMB. Based on the safety&#xD;
      results and DSMB recommendations, the second group of patients will include additional 16&#xD;
      patients that will be enrolled and treated, as detailed below for group 2. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo complete surgical excision at the end of the 8 weeks post treatment period and will&#xD;
      be followed up until complete clearance is confirmed by biopsy and the wound is closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will go through the following periods during the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening and enrollment period (up to 2 weeks, visit#1):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening and enrollment duration will be up to 2 weeks and will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           signing informed consent, recording demographics, medical history and concomitant&#xD;
           medications, vital signs, physical examination, lesion photography and assessments, and&#xD;
           shave biopsy. Only patients with histologically confirmed BCC can be enrolled and start&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment Period (1-3 weeks, 10-14 visits- visits#2-15)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1: 16 patients- 8 patients with superficial BCC and 8 patients with nodular BCC&#xD;
           will undergo 7 treatment applications, once every other day (2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 2: Based on safety results of stage 1 and following DSMB review and&#xD;
           recommendations, 16 additional patients (8 patient with superficial BCC and 8 patients&#xD;
           with nodular BCC) will undergo 7 daily applications. In case of tolerability issues a&#xD;
           rescue therapy of either 7 applications every other day (same as in group 1) or 1 day of&#xD;
           drug holiday after which daily treatment will continue, will be allowed as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In both groups, EX-02 5% will be topically applied on the lesion's surface including a&#xD;
           margin of 5-10mm, for 8-12 hours each application. All pre application assessments and&#xD;
           applications s will be performed at the clinic. Dressing removal will be completed by&#xD;
           the patient (by a family member/caregiver) at the patient's home. Between applications,&#xD;
           the lesion will be covered by hydrocolloid dressing (applied by the patient or by a&#xD;
           family member/caregiver). The treatment area including the skin around the lesion will&#xD;
           be photographed before each application at the clinic and assessment of AEs will be&#xD;
           performed by the investigator before application and post dressing removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This period will include 10 on-site visits, 7 visits for pre application assessments and&#xD;
           drug application (visits# 2, 4, 6, 8,10, 12, 14) and 3 on-site visits for post dressing&#xD;
           removal and assessments. The following three (3) post dressing removal visits will be&#xD;
           performed at the clinic: after first application (post dressing removal) (visit#3),&#xD;
           after second application (post dressing removal) (visit#5) and after last application&#xD;
           (post dressing removal) (Visit#15). Additional 4 visits post dressing removal (visits#7,&#xD;
           9, 11 and 13) are optional and will be completed only if needed per PI discretion. These&#xD;
           optional visits, if performed, can be performed either at the clinic or remotely (by an&#xD;
           IRB approved HIPAA compliance telecommunication). Local lab tests will be obtained on&#xD;
           visits#1(screening) and visit#15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post Treatment period (8 weeks, 4 bi-weekly remote or on site visits, visit#16-19):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post completion of treatment course, the raw bed and the surrounding skin will be&#xD;
           treated toward healing of the skin by Vaseline petrolatum or Aquaphor. Once in 2 weeks&#xD;
           the treated area will be photographed, the healing status of the wound and adverse&#xD;
           events will be assessed. Assessments on first 3 bi-weekly visits, visit#16- 18 will be&#xD;
           performed either on site or remotely (via IRB approved, HIPAA compliance&#xD;
           telecommunication), based on physician discretion. The 4th bi-weekly visit i.e. Visit&#xD;
           #19 will be performed on site. At the end of the 8 weeks post treatment period, on the&#xD;
           4th bi-weekly visit (visit#19), all patients will undergo complete excision, including a&#xD;
           lesion margin of 4-5 mm. The specimen will be sent to dermapathologist for histological&#xD;
           clearance examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow Up (until complete clearance and wound closure is achieved, at least one visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow up stage, patients will be followed and treated with standard of care.&#xD;
      Follow up visit # 20 will be performed once biopsy results are available (from the excision&#xD;
      performed on visit#19). Results will be recorded in the eCRF. In cases that margins are not&#xD;
      clear, patients will undergo additional excisional procedure per standard of care.&#xD;
      Histological results from any additional procedure will be recorded. In cases that margin are&#xD;
      clear but additional procedure for wound closure is required, the procedure will be recorded.&#xD;
      AEs will be monitored until complete clearance of margins is histologically confirmed and&#xD;
      until wound is assessed as closed (and sutured were removed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study for each participating subject is approximately 14-17 weeks:&#xD;
      Screening periods (1-2 weeks) + Treatment (1-3 weeks) + Follow up post treatment and&#xD;
      histopathology 8 weeks post treatment + Follow up post-surgical excision (approximately 4&#xD;
      weeks- until wound closure).&#xD;
