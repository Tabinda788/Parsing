      This is an open label, phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      coronavirus-specific T cell (CST) therapy for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive donor-derived CSTs for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection after&#xD;
      HSCT (≥28 days and &lt;4 months after HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this dose escalation trial, three doses (1x107/m2, 2x107/m2, and 4x107/m2) will be tested&#xD;
      for safety, with study arms for adult (≥18 years of age and &lt;80 years) HSCT recipients (Arm&#xD;
      A) and pediatric (≥12 years of age and &lt;18 years) HSCT recipients (Arm B), and defined dose&#xD;
      escalations in each study arm. The study agent will be assessed for safety (stopping rules&#xD;
      defined) and antiviral activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this phase I study is to assess the safety of administering&#xD;
      donor-derived CSTs in immunocompromised participants for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
      Related and unrelated donors of participants who are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be&#xD;
      enrolled for screening and production of CSTs from peripheral blood. Following product&#xD;
      manufacturing, participants who have undergone HSCT will receive donor-derived CSTs for&#xD;
      prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a dose escalation study with separate study arms for adult (Arm A) and pediatric&#xD;
      (Arm B) recipients of HSCT who are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants who have&#xD;
      undergone HSCT and test negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection will be enrolled and receive one&#xD;
      dose of CST product derived from their HSCT donor for prophylaxis. Participants aged ≥18&#xD;
      years and &lt;80 years will be enrolled on Arm A and participants who are ≥12 years of age and&#xD;
      &lt;18 years of age will be enrolled on Arm B. Investigators will test three doses: 1x107 /m2,&#xD;
      2x107 /m2, and 4x107 /m2. At least 3 adult participants (Arm A) will be enrolled at each dose&#xD;
      level before pediatric participants (Arm B) are enrolled. At each dose level, treatment of&#xD;
      the first two adult participants enrolled at that dose level will be staggered at least 28&#xD;
      days apart and each will be followed for the 45-day safety monitoring period to assess safety&#xD;
      and efficacy. Once the third adult participant on any given dose level has completed their&#xD;
      45-day safety monitoring period and the safety and efficacy data is reviewed and approved by&#xD;
      the FDA, then adult participants can be escalated to the next dose level and pediatric&#xD;
      participants can start enrollment at the dose level completed by the adult participants. If&#xD;
      participants show evidence of safety and at least 2 of 3 have evidence of antiviral immune&#xD;
      reconstitution against SARS-CoV-2, investigators will enroll pediatric participants at that&#xD;
      dose level following FDA approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, infusion of pediatric participants enrolled at each dose level will be&#xD;
      staggered at least 28 days apart, and all enrolled participants will be followed for 45 days&#xD;
      for safety monitoring after CST infusion.&#xD;
