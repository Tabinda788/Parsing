  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to understand if taking VTX002 daily as a tablet orally is safe and effective&#xD;
      in participants diagnosed with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Approximately 180&#xD;
      participants will take VTX002 Dose A, VTX002 Dose B, or matching placebo, once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 28-day Screening Period (to see if a participant qualifies for the&#xD;
      study), a 13-week double-blind period (a participant receives either active Dose A, Dose B or&#xD;
      Placebo), a 39-week OLE Treatment Period (all participants receive active treatment) and a&#xD;
      2-week Follow-Up Period&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of VTX002 in subjects with moderately to severely active UC following&#xD;
      daily oral administration of VTX002 as a tablet. Approximately 180 eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive VTX002 Dose A, VTX002 Dose B, or matching placebo,&#xD;
      once daily (approximately 60 subjects per treatment group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 28-day Screening Period, a 13-week double-blind Induction Treatment&#xD;
      Period (including 7 days of titration followed by 12 weeks of treatment at the assigned&#xD;
      dose), a 39-week Open-Label Extension (OLE) Treatment Period (including 7 days of titration&#xD;
      followed by up to 38 weeks of treatment with VTX002), and a 2-week Follow-Up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of VTX002 when administered for 13 weeks on clinical remission&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of VTX002 when administered for 13 weeks on endoscopic changes,&#xD;
           symptomatic response and remission, histology, and mucosal healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety of VTX002 after daily doses for 13 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of VTX002&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints The primary and 4 key secondary endpoints will be tested for superiority of VTX002&#xD;
      Dose A verses placebo and VTX002 Dose B verses placebo. The remaining endpoints will be&#xD;
      presented descriptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of subjects with clinical remission at Week 13 using modified Mayo score&#xD;
           (MMS) Key Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at Week 13&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of subjects with symptomatic remission at Week 13&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of subjects with histologic remission at Week 13&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of subjects with mucosal healing at Week 13 Safety Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities, and change from baseline in&#xD;
           laboratory values (eg., hematology and serum chemistry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of clinically significant vital sign abnormalities and changes from baseline&#xD;
