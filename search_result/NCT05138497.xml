  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyze the effects of a program based on high intensity interval training and low impact&#xD;
      on the state of health and the physical, functional, cognitive and psychological condition in&#xD;
      Colombian people over 65 years of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research corresponds to an experimental study, a double-blind randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial, where a total of 92 men and women 65 years old will be evaluated, distributed&#xD;
      in two groups: the experimental group will receive a Beat Fit-type HIFT program (n = 46) 12&#xD;
      weeks; and the control group (n = 46) that will only receive general recommendations on the&#xD;
      benefits of physical exercise. The variables will be measured for both groups with the same&#xD;
      validated tools and the same researcher to avoid information biases and differential&#xD;
      incorrect classification. The evaluations will be carried out at the beginning of the&#xD;
      intervention and immediately after the end of this period, and the results will be recorded&#xD;
      in a data record that will later be unified in an Excel database registering a code for each&#xD;
      participant to maintain condition of privacy, but at the same time allow the required&#xD;
      comparability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the independent variables, the sociodemographic characteristics, clinical history and the&#xD;
      socio-family assessment scale will be addressed; The result variables are divided by areas:&#xD;
      those focused on health status will measure the relative risk of death due to Comorbidity&#xD;
      from the Charlson Index, Health-related Quality of Life [HRQoL] with the SF36 questionnaire,&#xD;
      the Questionnaire To determine sarcopenia, it will be the SARC-F (Strength, Assistance with&#xD;
      walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs and Falls) and the Fried fragility phenotype will be&#xD;
      applied. For the physical condition variables, the ECFA battery will be used; for the&#xD;
      execution of sequential locomotive tasks it will be measured with the &quot;8-foot up-and-go&#xD;
      test&quot;; gait and balance from the Tinetti Scale, Gait Speed with the 6-minute Test; and&#xD;
      postural stability and balance from the Berg Scale. For the functional variables, the Katz&#xD;
      Index (activities of daily living), the Lawton &amp; Brody Index of the Vice-Rector's Office for&#xD;
      Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Permanent Training (instrumental activities of daily life)&#xD;
      and the Siu and Reuben physical scale ( Advanced activities of daily living). For the&#xD;
      Cognitive Variable, the Minimental Status Examination (MMSE) and for the psychological&#xD;
      variables, Yesavage will be applied for depression, the Pittsburgh Index for sleep quality&#xD;
      and fear of falling with the international scale FES-I (Falls Efficacy Scale-International).&#xD;
      All variables will have pre and post intervention measurements. As a result, a dance-based&#xD;
      HILIT training program (Beat Fit) is expected to improve the health, physical, functional,&#xD;
      cognitive and psychological condition of Colombian adults over 65 years of age, thus&#xD;
      contributing to the comprehensive approach of this population. Once the intervention is&#xD;
      completed, the final evaluation will be carried out and, from the comparative process, define&#xD;
      if there are significant differences with respect to the results obtained initially.&#xD;

    <masking_description>For the assignment to the groups, a random sampling will be carried out from the Epidat program. This classification will be hidden, therefore, those responsible for admitting patients to the intervention phase will not know which group each has been assigned to. Said assignment will be previously carried out by a researcher who will not intervene in the subsequent phases of evaluation, data recording intervention and database development. The assignment will be communicated by sealed and totally opaque envelopes. The analysis of the results will be carried out by a researcher outside the group assignment and the intervention.</masking_description>

In a conventional way, the following classification can be assumed:&#xD;
Grades A-B or 0 - 1 points = absence of disability or mild disability.&#xD;
Grades C-D or 2 - 3 points = moderate disability.&#xD;
Grades E-G or 4 - 6 points = severe disability.</description>

The maximum dependence would be marked by obtaining 0 points, while a sum of 8 points would express total independence.</description>
