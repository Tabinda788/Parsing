    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, investigator-initiated trial (IIT), divided into&#xD;
      dose escalation (Part A) and dose extension (Part B) phases to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacokinetics (PD) and initial efficacy of conjugated&#xD;
      antibody redirecting ready-to-use allogeneic NK (CAR-raNK) cells that target trophoblast&#xD;
      glycoprotein (5T4) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A is a dose escalation study to evaluate maximum toxic dose (MTD) and/or RP2D which&#xD;
      adopts the 3+3 dose escalation design protocol. The dose is respectively 2.0 × 10^9 live&#xD;
      cells and 3.0 × 10^9 live cells (if the safety of dose group with 3.0 × 10^9 live cells is&#xD;
      still good, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will co-decide whether to continue the dose&#xD;
      escalation and the specific dose based on the obtained data on safety, efficacy, and PK), and&#xD;
      the administration is performed on day 1 and day 3 of each cycle (21 days). 3-6 subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled at every dose level. The first and second subjects in the same group shall be&#xD;
      enrolled at an interval of at least 2 weeks, for the purpose of ensuring their safety. Only&#xD;
      when the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of all subjects in the previous dose group was observed&#xD;
      can the enrollment of the next dose group get started. Part B is the dose extension study.&#xD;
      After recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is determined in Part A, the SMC will discuss whether&#xD;
      to conduct the Part B study. This stage will be carried out in different tumor types with&#xD;
      high expression of 5T4 antigen, and 20 to 30 subjects will be enrolled in each tumor type,&#xD;
      and all subjects will receive anti-5T4 CAR-raNK cell therapy at RP2D level. Every 21 days is&#xD;
      one cycle, and the administration is performed on day 1 and day 3 of each cycle.&#xD;
