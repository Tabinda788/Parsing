    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies have shown that before giving combined acupuncture and medicine&#xD;
      anesthesia, electroacupuncture (EA) needs to be started three days before in order to produce&#xD;
      a sequential effect. In combined acupuncture and drug anesthesia, the core goal is to use&#xD;
      acupuncture to reduce the insufficiency of anesthetics in terms of analgesia, sedation,&#xD;
      stable circulation, and protection of organs. However, the mechanism of action behind this&#xD;
      combination has not yet been changed. The pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics has been&#xD;
      convincingly explained, or the degree of recognition is not high, such as whether acupuncture&#xD;
      has a specific target in the body, if there is a specific target, where the effect target is&#xD;
      located ? Will it affect the metabolic enzymes and will it further affect the efficacy or&#xD;
      toxicity of the drugs metabolized by the metabolic enzymes? What effect will it have on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic mechanism? Given that it may involve complex pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic mechanisms, this study will first use doxofylline (DOXO) as a probe to study&#xD;
      and explain its effect on metabolic enzymes to further clarify whether it will produce&#xD;
      therapeutic drugs Influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxofylline (DOXO), as an old drug that has been used for many years, has extremely high&#xD;
      safety and strong selectivity. It is a clinical drug with an injectable dosage form. Studies&#xD;
      have proved that DOXO can be used as a high-quality P450 mixed-function oxidase CYP1A in vivo&#xD;
      probe. DOXO is a metabolic clearance-leading drug in the human body, and it must undergo the&#xD;
      initiation metabolism of CYP1A in the cell to be transformed into theophylline acetaldehyde (&#xD;
      TA), and then theophylline acetic acid (TAA) and hydroxyethyl theophylline (ETO) produced by&#xD;
      disproportionation. Therefore, quantitative detection of TAA and ETO can calculate the&#xD;
      maximum activity of CYP1A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the kinetics of DOXO and reduce the inconvenience of excessive blood&#xD;
      sampling points for long-term continuous administration, we will explore the method of&#xD;
      detecting DOXO kinetics by the Vmax method through clinical research to characterize whether&#xD;
      acupuncture affects the metabolic enzyme CYP1A&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the face of complex medical challenges, diversified medications, combination medications,&#xD;
      compound medications, and precision medications have shown a clear upward trend. Quantitative&#xD;
      monitoring of drugs in the body has gradually become a routine. However, this conventional&#xD;
      method not only has a lag in time, but also has a scientific principle. There are also&#xD;
      serious defects in nature. Time lag is manifested as a lack of predictability and individual&#xD;
      differences over time. In principle, drug changes are the result of the body's reaction to&#xD;
      drugs.Therefore, the body characteristics related to drug metabolism need to be evaluated&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current therapeutic drug monitoring is almost lack of theoretical support. From the&#xD;
      perspective of safety and mechanism-based pharmacokinetics, its specific manifestations are&#xD;
      as follows: 1. Considering the individual safety, although there is the information support&#xD;
      of group medicine, the drug dose must also be tested from a small dose; 2. The plasma drug&#xD;
      concentration must be completed by multi-point continuous overall kinetic process test or&#xD;
      obtained by model derivation, such as in vitro derivation based on enzymatic Michaelis&#xD;
      kinetic parameters; 3. Single point plasma concentration can not replace the overall kinetic&#xD;
      model. If necessary, there must be many assumptions and conditions. Therefore, the&#xD;
      steady-state single point therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) test obviously does not have the&#xD;
      above three functions. Its data is unreasonably amplified to guide the accurate clinical&#xD;
      administration, which will inevitably lead to many defects existing in principle, that is,&#xD;
      &quot;single point TDM&quot; In principle, it can not cope with such a complex clinical treatment&#xD;
      shared by multiple drugs and the prediction of drug-drug interaction (DDI). In vivo probe is&#xD;
      an effective method to evaluate the influence of the body on the attribute law of drugs in&#xD;
      vivo. Only based on the effective discrimination of the attribute law of drugs in vivo, can&#xD;
      we obtain a complete prediction of the change law of a specific drug, and turn the passive&#xD;
      technical method of blood concentration detection into initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOXO is a metabolism-oriented drug, which is metabolized by CYP1A to TA, which further&#xD;
      metabolizes TAA and ETO, so the amount of TAA and ETO can represent the activity of CYP1A, We&#xD;
      will explore the method of detecting DOXO kinetics by Vmax method through clinical research.&#xD;
      The entire clinical study is divided into two stages, the first stage is the solution of&#xD;
      Vmax, and the second stage is the verification of the overall pharmacokinetics. Clinically,&#xD;
      multi-drug combination is very easy to produce DDI, and the production of DDI is nothing more&#xD;
      than pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic interactions. Therefore, when combining drugs or&#xD;
      applying acupuncture and drug combination, it is also necessary to monitor the effects and&#xD;
      effects of metabolic enzymes in the body on the drugs, and then to determine the safety and&#xD;
      the mechanism of the effect of multi-drug sharing. Therefore, further explore acupuncture.&#xD;
      Combined with the pharmacokinetic law of DOXO to explore the mechanism of the combined action&#xD;
      of acupuncture and medicine.&#xD;
