      Research Question How does maternal blood pressure respond in the postpartum period for women&#xD;
      who had a hypertensive disorder in pregnancy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To evaluate the recovery of maternal blood pressure after a pregnancy affected by new&#xD;
      onset hypertension after twenty weeks gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify rates of persistent hypertension after pregnancies affected by HDP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the accuracy of HBPM against the gold standard of ABPM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the maternal acceptance of HBPM and ABPM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore what CVD-related care information is provided at the 6-8 week GP appointment&#xD;

      This research aims to investigate how women's blood pressure responds after birth and assess&#xD;
      the time it takes to return to normal ranges. This will be calculated by participants&#xD;
      undertaking three consecutive days of home blood pressure monitoring, every fortnight from&#xD;
      two until twelve weeks postpartum. At twelve weeks postpartum, women will have a twenty-four&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure assessment. This will highlight the prevalence of persistent high&#xD;
      blood pressure and how often GPs will need to monitor women's blood pressure in the immediate&#xD;
      few weeks after birth. Women will be asked to complete a questionnaire after their six to&#xD;
      eight week GP appointment, assessing if women recall having their blood pressure checked&#xD;
      and/or the risks of heart disease explained to them and if they received any lifestyle advice&#xD;
      to reduce these risks. Women will be asked to complete a second questionnaire at twelve weeks&#xD;
      postpartum assessing their acceptance and preference of home and twenty four hour blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring. This research aims to identify any gaps in the current care of women in&#xD;
      the postnatal period and use this information to provide better quality of care to women so&#xD;
      they can lead healthier lives and reduce their risk of heart disease.&#xD;
