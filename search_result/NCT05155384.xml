  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effects of biopsychosocial and conventional approach&#xD;
      on symptom severity, pain parameters (pain intensity and pain cognitions), disability,&#xD;
      psychological distress and quality of life in the treatment of bladder pain&#xD;
      syndrome/interstitial cystitis. The study is designed as a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into one of the two research arms: biopsychosocial approach group or conventional&#xD;
      approach group. A biopsychosocial approach, which is a holistic approach that includes pain&#xD;
      neuroscience education, relaxation training and cognitive exercises, will be applied to the&#xD;
      patients in the first research arm for the treatment of chronic pain symptoms. For the&#xD;
      patients in the second research arm, a conventional approach including pelvic floor&#xD;
      stretching exercises and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) will be applied&#xD;
      for the treatment of chronic pain complaints. Treatments will be lasted for a total of six&#xD;
      weeks, with two sessions per week. Participants will be evaluated in at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and at the end of the 6th week. At the beginning of the study, information about the&#xD;
      demographic and physical characteristics, medical and surgical background, drugs used and&#xD;
      lifestyle characteristics (water, tea, coffee, alcohol, cigarette consumption, the presence&#xD;
      constipation and physical activity level) of the individuals will be recorded. For primary or&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures, Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index, Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, 3-day voiding diary,&#xD;
      Pain Disability Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Short Form-36 and Global&#xD;
      Response Assessment will be used. Our study is planned to be carried out with a total of 60&#xD;
      individuals, 30 for each research branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, we will compare the effects of biopsychosocial and conventional&#xD;
      approach on symptom and problem severity, pain parameters, disability, psychological status&#xD;
      and quality of life in patients with bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis.&#xD;

    <description>The Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index will be used to assess the severity of symptoms. This scale consists of two separate parts as symptom and problem index, both of which are four questions. Participants will be asked to fill in both parts.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>severity of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>change in severity of pain from baseline up to end of 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity will be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Considering the last week, the patients will be asked to mark the severity of pain on a 10-centimeter (cm) straight line, with the starting end as &quot;no pain&quot; and the ending end as &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. It will be calculated in cm by measuring the starting tip and the part marked by the patient.</description>

    <measure>Pain cognitions</measure>
    <time_frame>change in pain cognitions from baseline up to end of 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire will be used to assess individuals' cognitions about pain (catastrophizing and self-efficacy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>urinary symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>change in urinary symptoms from baseline up to end of 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>A 3-day voiding diary will be used to evaluate Urinary Symptoms. On this chart, they are asked to record the time they urinate, the amount of urine, the presence of urinary incontinence, the amount and type of fluid consumed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>severity of disability</measure>
    <time_frame>change in severity of disability from baseline up to end of 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Disability Index will be used to question the impact of individuals' daily life due to their pain and the resulting disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>psychological distress</measure>
    <time_frame>change in psychological distress from baseline up to end of 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be used to evaluate the psychological distress of individuals. The questionnaire has two sub-dimensions, depression and anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of life of the patients</measure>
    <time_frame>change in quality of life from baseline up to end of 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed using the SF-36 scale. Short Form-36 will be used for evaluations. This questionnaire consists of eight different sub-parameters (physical function, physical role difficulty, general health status, pain status, energy/fatigue, social function, emotional role difficulty, and emotional well-being).</description>
