      This was a single-arm, prospective study to investigate the safety of cetuximab in&#xD;
      combination with trifluridin tipiracil (TAS-102) in the third-line treatment of Chinese&#xD;
      patients with RAS wild-type mCRC. Cetuximab will be administered at a fixed dose of 500 mg/m2&#xD;
      once every 2 weeks; trifluridin tipiracil will be administered in a dose de-escalation&#xD;
      design: dose level 1: 35 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-5 once every 2 weeks; after 1 cycle will&#xD;
      be observed, and if ≤ 2 patients experience DLT, this dose level will be the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose; if ≥ 3 patients experience DLT, additional 6 patients will receive dose level&#xD;
      0. ( Dose level 0: 30 mg/m2, twice daily, Days 1-5, once every 2 weeks;) If ≤ 2 individuals&#xD;
      experience DLT, this dose level is the recommended Phase II dose; if ≥ 3 individuals&#xD;
      experience DLT, the study will be stopped.&#xD;
