  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DIGITS Trial addresses a critical knowledge gap: How to best implement digital treatments&#xD;
      for opioids and other substance use disorders in primary care. The DIGITS Trial is a&#xD;
      partnership between Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in&#xD;
      Seattle, and Kaiser Permanente Washington, a healthcare delivery system in Washington State.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the FDA-authorized reSET and reSET-O digital therapeutics will be implemented&#xD;
      in Kaiser Permanente Washington primary care clinics. The study will evaluate the extent to&#xD;
      which two implementation strategy interventions, health coaching and practice coaching,&#xD;
      improve the implementation. Primary care clinics are randomized to receive these&#xD;
      implementation strategy interventions. Each clinic will have a 12-month active implementation&#xD;
      period beginning on its date of randomization. To study the continued use of reSET and&#xD;
      reSET-O after the active implementation period is completed, a sustainment period of up 12&#xD;
      months will follow the active implementation period.&#xD;

      Specific Aims of the DIGITS Trial are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate the effect of practice facilitation and health coaching implementation&#xD;
           strategies in increasing the reach and fidelity of a digital therapeutic for substance&#xD;
           use disorders in primary care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the population-level cost-effectiveness of each implementation strategy in&#xD;
           increasing reach, fidelity, and abstinence.&#xD;
