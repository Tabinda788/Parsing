      This is a study trial to assess the effectiveness of the immune response stimulated by the&#xD;
      genetically engineered Bacillus subtilis spore extract which contain Spike protein of the&#xD;
      SARS-COV2 on the spore coat.&#xD;

      COVID-19 immunization reduces the risk of COVID-19 and potentially serious complications. In&#xD;
      clinical trials, all COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use in the United States are&#xD;
      beneficial in protecting adults and children 5 years and older against COVID-19, including&#xD;
      severe illness. So far, studies looking at how COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world&#xD;
      conditions (vaccine effectiveness studies) have shown that they work well. However, it has&#xD;
      been reported that most of the antibodies in people who received the second dose of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine had been dramatically decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) is a generally regarded as safe organism and it is a common&#xD;
      food source. We have used an engineered Bacillus subtilis spore which express and display the&#xD;
      spike protein receptor binding domain (sRBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 on the surface. We have proved&#xD;
      that it successfully increased the neutralizing antibody against sRBD in unvaccinated mice&#xD;
      and human individuals after oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis, we designed and developed an oral antibody booster by extracting the spore&#xD;
      surface of B. subtilis. This supplement has the advantage of being stable and effective, free&#xD;
      of recombinant plasmid, and can be served as a potential antibody booster to existing&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mice toxicity and efficacy test was conducted and the experiment proved that the B. subtilis&#xD;
      spores extract was effective in inducing immune response, and it was safe and did not cause&#xD;
      any significant adverse effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The B. subtilis spore extract will be further studied in a human trials through oral&#xD;
      administration to test its safety and the immune effect resulted in human body.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Volunteers who vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines for over 6 months will be recruited and will receive 1 capsule of neutralizing antibody booster. Their weight, blood pressure, and the concentration of neutralizing IgG antibody against receptor binding domain of spike protein in SARS-CoV2 will be measured before the oral administration and 14, 28 days after the administration. Number of adverse event from the beginning of the administration to 30 days after the administration will also be recorded.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Bacillus subtilis, a harmless intestinal commensal, has earned in recent years, great reputation as a vaccine production host and delivery vector with advantages such as low cost, safe for human consumption and straightforward administration. The technology team has succeeded engineering Bacillus subtilis with spore coat proteins resembling the proteins of the nucleus and spikes of coronavirus. This product could have a vaccine like activity within the intestinal environment.</description>
