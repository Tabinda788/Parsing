  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is the most common kind of arthritis that occurs due to degeneration of&#xD;
      the joint articular cartilage, producing pain, stiffness, and impaired movement. Kinesio&#xD;
      taping is a simple and inexpensive therapeutic procedure that can help with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis symptoms. Kinesio taping is a high-stretch elastic adhesive material that&#xD;
      allows the treated area to have free mobility. This technique was preferred by physical&#xD;
      therapists for knee osteoarthritis rehabilitation because of its positive effects, such as&#xD;
      decreased pain and increased mobility and muscular performance.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NUMERICAL PAIN RATING SCALE</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The average pain intensity was measured during the past week, with zero representing no pain and ten representing the worst pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>GONIOMETRIC MEASUREMENT OF KNEE RANGE OF MOTION</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both the knee flexion and extension ROM were measured while the subject was in a prone position. The measurement was done three times and the average result was obtained.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>WESTERN ONTARIO AND MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES OSTEOARTHRITIS INDEX (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire was developed to measure treatment outcomes in patients with lower extremity osteoarthritis, such as pain, stiffness, and difficulty, and it employs a scale to categorize the difficulties in activities of daily living. For individuals with hip and knee osteoarthritis, the WOMAC scale is a valid and reliable outcome measurement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>TIMED UP AND GO (TUG) TEST</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The test combines static and dynamic balance to assess a person's mobility. Getting out of a chair, walking three meters, turning around, and returning to the chair to sit. The international research OA society recommends a series of physical function measures (five performance-based) for individual with hip or knee OA, including the TUG test.24 The aforementioned outcome parameters are measured at three-time intervals: 0-week, 3-week, and 6-week.</description>

    <description>Kinesio taping The patient is in a supine position with full knee flexion. Prior to application, the skin surface was cleaned. This technique involved the use of two Y-cut strips and two I-cut strips.</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation TENS device settings, such as the frequency of 32-50 Hz, pulse width of 80 ms, and symmetrical biphasic waveform. The surface electrodes were placed on the medial and lateral superior borders of the patella, as well as the medial and lateral inferior borders of the patella.&#xD;
Exercise therapy program The total duration of each exercise session was about 50 minutes, including warm-up-10 minutes, resistance exercise-20 minutes, balance and stability exercise-10 minutes, lower-limb stretching exercise-5 minutes, and cool-down exercise-5 minutes. The same assigned physical therapist supervised all of the sessions.</description>
