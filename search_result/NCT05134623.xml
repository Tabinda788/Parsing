      Smurf2 and bladder cancer - research proposal summary The Smurf2 gene was recently identified&#xD;
      as a tumor suppressor gene. It is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and carries a significant role in&#xD;
      major cellular processes such as cell division, genomic stability, DNA repair as well as&#xD;
      resistance to anti-tumoral drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that in several common tumors (prostate, breast, osteosarcoma etc.), a&#xD;
      significant decrease in the expression or activity of Smurf2 can be noted, making the cells&#xD;
      more susceptible to malignant transformation and the tumors more aggressive and highly&#xD;
      resistant to various medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer is no. 4 cancer in men and 6 in women, and a major cause of cancer related&#xD;
      death. Common risk factors are smoking and occupational exposure to aniline dyes or aromatic&#xD;
      amines. Its' most common presentation is painless hematuria. Once the diagnosis of a bladder&#xD;
      tumor is made, endoscopic resection of the tumors is performed. Superficial tumors of low&#xD;
      malignancy may be treated by repeated resections, highly malignant tumors require additional&#xD;
      therapy and aggressive tumors invading the bladder muscle layer require radical surgery and&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy. Therefore, all patients are closely monitored by repeated cystoscopies&#xD;
      (endoscopic inspection of the bladder), each 3 months, lifelong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to minimize patients' discomfort, there is a constant search for a reliable&#xD;
      biomarker in the urine of patients. A marker with good sensitivity and specificity will&#xD;
      predict in a noninvasive fashion early recurrence or absence of bladder tumors, sparing the&#xD;
      need for invasive cystoscopy. The presence of a biomarker may be used as prognostic factor or&#xD;
      a measure of response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to characterize the presence of smurf2 in bladder tumors and&#xD;
      determine whether it may be utilized as a reliable biomarker for bladder cancer.&#xD;

      Smurf2 and bladder cancer - research proposal summary - detailed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Smurf2 gene was recently identified as a tumor suppressor gene. It is an E3 ubiquitin&#xD;
      ligase and carries a significant role in major cellular processes such as cell division,&#xD;
      genomic stability, DNA repair as well as resistance to anti-tumoral drugs.&#xD;

      resistant to various medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer is no. 4 cancer in men and 6 in women, and a major cause of cancer related&#xD;
      death. Common risk factors are cigarrete smoking and occupational exposure to aniline dyes or&#xD;
      aromatic amines. Its' most common presentation is painless hematuria. Once the diagnosis of a&#xD;
      bladder tumor is made, endoscopic resection of the tumors is performed. Superficial tumors of&#xD;
      low malignancy may be treated by repeated resections, highly malignant tumors require&#xD;
      additional therapy and aggressive tumors invading the bladder muscle layer require radical&#xD;
      surgery and chemo-radiotherapy. Therefore, all patients are closely monitored by repeated&#xD;
      cystoscopies (endoscopic inspection of the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to minimize patients' discomfort, there is a constant search for a reliable&#xD;
      biomarker in the urine of patients. A marker with good sensitivity and specificity will&#xD;
      predict in a noninvasive fashion early recurrence or absence of bladder tumors, sparing the&#xD;

&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to characterize the presence of smurf2 in bladder tumors and&#xD;
      determine whether it may be utilized as a reliable biomarker for bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, the investigators will collect samples from bladder tumors of patient referred&#xD;
      for transurethral resection of a known bladder tumor. The tissue will be processed routinely&#xD;
      yet additional slides will be performed and used for immunohistochemical analysis. The&#xD;
      investigators will characterize the expression of SMURF2 in the tissue, its abundance, the&#xD;
      distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm and possible differences between the tumors&#xD;
      tissue and surrounding normal margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further on, the investigators will collect urine samples from patients with these tumors and&#xD;
      examine the urinary sediment using PCR and proteomic examination. The data will be used for&#xD;
      further research using the SMURF2 product as a possible novel bio-marker for the presence of&#xD;
      bladder tumors and for non-invasive detection and follow-up of patients on surveillance&#xD;
      following surgical treatment.&#xD;
