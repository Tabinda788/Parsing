      Effect of Otago exercise in Total Knee Replacement&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative knee arthritis is one of the most common diseases in the elderly population. Age&#xD;
      is the strongest risk factor for osteoarthritis. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study&#xD;
      reports that the burden of musculoskeletal disorders is much larger than estimated in&#xD;
      previous assessments and accounts for 6.8% of daily worldwide. An estimated 10% to 15% of all&#xD;
      adults aged over 60 have some degree of OA. In Pakistan, 3.6% in rural and 3.1-4.6% in urban&#xD;
      parts of Pakistan were found diagnosed by knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When conservative treatments fail to control the symptoms, joint replacement is performed.&#xD;
      Specifically, more than 1 million surgeries are performed every year in the United States&#xD;
      (US) alone, with a total expenditure close to 13.7 billion and 28.5 billion US dollars for&#xD;
      the hips and knees, respectively. The demand is expected to increase by approximately 4 time&#xD;
      by the year 2030 annually more than 4000 joint have been replaced in Pakistan.&quot; Overall, the&#xD;
      progress of patients after joint replacement is satisfactory. Nevertheless, a substantial&#xD;
      number may present with functional and balance limitations, even 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross sectional study reported that a Home-based balance and strength exercises (OEP)&#xD;
      benefited older fallers with OA and gait and balance disorders by improving postural control.&#xD;
      Another study has been done which suggested that elderly people who performed the OEP showed&#xD;
      an increase in balance, muscle strength, and a decrease in both fall percentage and fall&#xD;
      frequency. Evidence has recommended that, the OEP was more effective improving functional&#xD;
      balance, muscle strength and physical health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross sectional study was conducted to evaluate the influence of specific balance-targeted&#xD;
      training on the overall state of balance in older adults undergoing TKR. They concluded that&#xD;
      the additional balance training program improved balance performance to a higher extent than&#xD;
      a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, pain and stiffness are remarkably relieved, but functional and proprioceptive&#xD;
      deficits, including limitation of lower limb mobility, difficulties in walking, and&#xD;
      alterations instability and balance may remain. However, the effect of Otago exercise on&#xD;
      balance are present in literature but the evidence for their influence in patients with TKR&#xD;
      is narrow. So aim of this study to identify the possible role of Otago exercise program in&#xD;
      particular population (TKR) and the prognosis in balance and Gait with this protocol in&#xD;
      patients undergoing TKR.&#xD;
