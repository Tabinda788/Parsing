  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Dortmund Vital Study is to validate previous hypotheses and to generate and&#xD;
      validate new hypotheses about the relationship of ageing, working conditions, genetic makeup,&#xD;
      stress, metabolic functions, cardiovascular system, immune system, and mental performance&#xD;
      over the lifespan with a focus on healthy working adults. The Dortmund Vital Study is a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary longitudinal study involving the Departments of Ergonomics, Immunology,&#xD;
      Psychology and Neurosciences, and Toxicology of the Leibniz Research Centre for Working&#xD;
      Environment and Human Factors at the TU Dortmund (IfADo) in Dortmund, Germany, as well as&#xD;
      several national and international cooperation partners.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Dortmund Vital Study is designed as a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal study.&#xD;
      About 600 subjects aged between 20 and 70 years will participate. A wide range of&#xD;
      demographic, psychological, behavioral, sensory, cardiovascular, biochemical, immunological&#xD;
      and biochemical data, a comprehensive EEG-based cognitive test battery as well as structural&#xD;
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been included in the study.&#xD;
      Specifically, parameters obtained by MRI and EEG-related measures can be evaluated as a&#xD;
      function of polygenic scores, metabolic products, concentration of immune cells, immune age&#xD;
      and infections, such as Toxoplasmosis or COVID-19 that are largely unexplored. The same is&#xD;
      true for environmental and lifestyle factors that impact on brain activity and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial testing has been conducted between 2016 and 2021 and will be repeated every five&#xD;
      years (three follow-up measures until 2035).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will shed light on sources of large inter-individual differences in cognitive&#xD;
      functioning with increasing age and reveal biological and lifestyle markers contributing to&#xD;
      work ability, longevity and healthy aging on the one hand, and on risk factors for cognitive&#xD;
      decline, mild cognitive impairment or even dementia on the other.&#xD;
