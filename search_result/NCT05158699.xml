  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a major cause of suboptimal postoperative visual acuity after&#xD;
      cataract surgery. Topical steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are&#xD;
      used to prevent CME. However, noncompliance with eye drops may compromise the effectiveness&#xD;
      of treatment. Dropless periocular drug delivery during cataract surgery may improve the&#xD;
      outcomes and cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery, and may alleviate the burden on homecare&#xD;
      organizations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent European multicentre study (PREvention of Macular EDema after cataract surgery;&#xD;
      PREMED), it was demonstrated that the combination of topical corticosteroids and NSAIDs&#xD;
      results in the lowest risk of developing CME after cataract surgery. However, noncompliance&#xD;
      with eye drops may compromise the effectiveness of treatment. Noncompliance is often&#xD;
      unintentional and related to forgetfulness or incorrect instillation, particularly in the&#xD;
      elderly cataract surgery population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments to&#xD;
      prevent CME after cataract surgery, using either topical drugs (control group) or&#xD;
      intra-/periocular injections (intervention groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that intra-/periocular anti-inflammatory drug delivery during&#xD;
      cataract surgery is effective in preventing CME, with better health-related quality of life&#xD;
      and improved cost-effectiveness compared to standard topical drug delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the change in central subfield mean macular thickness (CSMT)&#xD;
      at 6 weeks postoperatively as compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures are the&#xD;
      incidence of CME; the incidence of clinically significant macular edema (CSME); mean&#xD;
      corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA); para- and perifoveal thickness and total macular&#xD;
      volume (TMV); intraocular pressure (IOP); anterior chamber inflammation; vision-related&#xD;
      quality of life; and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of this study is a European randomised controlled multicenter trial. The study&#xD;
      population will consist of 808 patients aged 21 years or older who require cataract surgery&#xD;
      in at least one eye. Patients with a foreseen increased risk of developing CME or ophthalmic&#xD;
      disorders other than cataract will be excluded. Follow-up duration is 12 weeks. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted over a period of 36 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A block randomization procedure will be followed to acquire equal number of subjects in every treatment group. Patients are randomly allocated to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The various study centres will be taken into account during randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Masking will be achieved as much as possible. As there is an objective primary outcome, it will not be necessary to replace medicines by sham injections or placebo eye drops. Moreover, the ophthalmologist who performs the cataract surgery will not be blinded for treatment allocation of the subject. The study statistician, the data safety monitoring group, optometrists who perform the examinations (especially visual acuity) and observers who evaluate the examinations and OCTs will be masked when possible for treatment allocation.</masking_description>
