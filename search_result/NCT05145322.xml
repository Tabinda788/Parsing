      The aim of the study is to compare the short-term marginal integrity of two preparation&#xD;
      techniques for Class I composite restoration using two visual assessment techniques, the FDI&#xD;
      World Dental Federation and US Public Health Service assessment criteria. In addition,&#xD;
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will be used to assess the marginal integrity of the&#xD;
      restoration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A recent review on clinical studies published on the performance of posterior composite&#xD;
      restorations that were recalled at least up to 24-months reported that the overall failure&#xD;
      rates for studies conducted between 2006-2016 was 13.13% and the two main reasons for failure&#xD;
      in these two decades remained the same, i.e. secondary caries (25.68% - 29.47%) and composite&#xD;
      fracture (28.84% - 39.07%). In in vitro studies, secondary caries has been attributed to&#xD;
      interfacial gap or marginal defect both of which are consequences of polymerization&#xD;
      contraction stresses. However, to date no clinical study has been able to directly establish&#xD;
      a link between these stresses (and its consequences) to secondary caries. World Dental&#xD;
      Federation (FDI) and United States Public Health Service (USPHS) clinical assessment criteria&#xD;
      are the two main systems used to evaluate dental restorations in clinical trials. Both&#xD;
      systems are designed to evaluate different properties of a restoration and properties&#xD;
      pertaining to marginal integrity has been reported to be the most frequent properties&#xD;
      investigated of a resin composite restoration. The grading descriptions for these properties&#xD;
      are subjective and the discrimination between grading and between properties (especially&#xD;
      between marginal stains and secondary caries) are problematic. Reasons to the lack of such a&#xD;
      link is the discriminative deficiency of the clinical visual evaluation systems, the FDI and&#xD;
      USPHS assessment criteria, and the ethical dilemma of restoration removal to assess for&#xD;
      presence or absence of secondary caries. It has been long acknowledged that an objective&#xD;
      clinical measuring tool and new clinical study designs for secondary caries is needed to&#xD;
      further the understanding of secondary caries initiation and progression and how these&#xD;
      relates to the marginal integrity of dental restorations. This brings forth the need of a&#xD;
      sensitive yet clinically applicable assessment method for interfacial debonding and&#xD;
      demineralization. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical, nondestructive and&#xD;
      clinically- applicable technique that uses near infra red-light waves to provide&#xD;
      cross-sectional images of structures. It is regarded as a standard-of-care equipment in&#xD;
      ophthalmology and its clinical application has recently expanded to cardiology and&#xD;
      dermatology. In dentistry, it has been used intra-orally in clinical trials to detect and&#xD;
      quantify enamel demineralization and to detect mucosal and submucosal lesions. Optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography and has been used to assess the performance of dental adhesives in a&#xD;
      12-month in vivo trial on non-carious cervical lesion. The authors reported that OCT outcome&#xD;
      measures detected significant differences between groups while visual assessments did not.&#xD;
      Hence supplementing the two visual assessment techniques with OCT outcome measures is&#xD;
      expected to increase the sensitivity of short term interfacial debonding and demineralization&#xD;
      changes. The aim of the study is to compare the short-term marginal integrity of two&#xD;
      preparation techniques for Class I composite restoration using two visual assessment&#xD;
      techniques, the FDI World Dental Federation and US Public Health Service assessment criteria.&#xD;
      In addition, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will be used to assess the marginal integrity&#xD;
      of the restoration.&#xD;

The etchant will be rinsed away and an adhesive (3M Scotchbond™ Universal Adhesive) will be applied on dentine with a microbrush for 20 seconds. The adhesive will be light-cured for 10 sec with the Elipar S10 curing light (3M Oral Care).
