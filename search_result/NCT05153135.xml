    <textblock>
      This study used an observational, retrospective cohort design, using US administrative&#xD;
      insurance claims data, previously employed in an existing project, to better understand HRU&#xD;
      and healthcare costs among women with mBC initiated on a CDK4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult women with HR+/HER2- mBC initiated on a CDK4/6 inhibitor were included in the study and&#xD;
      were stratified into cohorts based on the first CDK4/6 inhibitor they received (i.e.,&#xD;
      abemaciclib, palbociclib, or ribociclib), regardless of the line of therapy and menopausal&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiation of the first CDK4/6 inhibitor was defined as the index date. The index&#xD;
      treatment was defined as the CDK4/6 inhibitor initiated on the index date (i.e., abemaciclib,&#xD;
      palbociclib, or ribociclib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6-month period preceding the index date was considered as the baseline period, and was&#xD;
      used to measure patient characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes were measured between the index date and 1) the end of the study period&#xD;
      (persistence, switch, HRU, costs) OR 2) the end of the index treatment (adherence, dose&#xD;
      modification, frequency of monitoring), as relevant. The end of the study period was defined&#xD;
      as the earliest occurrence between the end of continuous enrollment and the end of data&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;

    <description>Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU) was measured between index date and end of follow-up, and was separately measured during the studied line of therapy, and after the studied line of therapy. Because women have different durations of follow-up, the number of events were reported as the average total number of visits per patient-per-6-months (PPP6M). HRU PPP6M was defined as the total number of visits or services for a patient occurring during the relevant period, reported on a six-month basis.</description>

    <description>In addition to the all-cause HRU components, specific condition-related HRU was also analyzed. Conditions considered included those frequently encountered in clinical trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors. This included the number of days with medical services, number of IP days, number of non-IP days, and proportion of women with at least one medical service associated with a diagnosis for the following conditions:&#xD;
Thrombolic events (e.g., thrombophlebitis/deep vein thrombosis)&#xD;
