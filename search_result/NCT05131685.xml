      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distal radius fractures (DRFs) make up 20-25% of all pediatric fractures (Brudvik 2003,&#xD;
      Cooper 2004), and are the most common fractures seen in the emergency department in children&#xD;
      in the United States. (Naranje 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The available evidence on distal radius fracture (DRF) reduction/non-reduction is based on&#xD;
      case series, observational comparisons, and expert opinions. Displaced metaphyseal DRFs have&#xD;
      historically been treated with attempts at closed reduction (under conscious sedation or&#xD;
      anesthesia). This approach was supported by retrospective studies and consensus opinion that&#xD;
      anatomical alignment was necessary for normal function.(Rockwood 2010 text, Bae 2012 JPO)&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is unsettling for physicians and families to see bones overlapped on a&#xD;
      radiograph when a straightening procedure can be completed in a straightforward fashion.&#xD;
      However, simple immobilization without attempted reduction has recently been reported for&#xD;
      management of DRFs in children under age 10.(Crawford 2012) This approach is conceptually&#xD;
      supported by the fracture's proximity to the distal radial physis and the remaining growth of&#xD;
      the child, which provides significant remodeling potential and can allow for improvement of&#xD;
      malalignment as the child grows.(Crawford 2010 JBJSAm, Price 1990 JPO) There is a paucity of&#xD;
      literature comparing reduced to non-reduced fractures to guide management. No established or&#xD;
      standardized guidelines exist for the optimal management of completely displaced fractures.&#xD;
      Surveys have identified widely discrepant recommendations and high practice variation for&#xD;
      treatments for identical DRF patterns.(Georgiadis 2019 POSNA or JPO 2020) Although these&#xD;
      studies provide preliminary data to support clinical management, the studies lack a control&#xD;
      population for comparison, are retrospective, lack randomization, have variable follow-up&#xD;
      times and have no standard definitions of outcomes. In addition, the studies used&#xD;
      radiographic or non-validated outcome measures to make conclusions, limiting their utility in&#xD;
      identifying optimal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears that children may be undergoing unnecessary procedures, sedations, and&#xD;
      anesthetics. The use of anesthesia and sedation has recently come into question as studies&#xD;
      examine their effects on cognitive development. (Loepke 2013, Flick 2011) There could be a&#xD;
      significant cost savings in terms of procedure costs, hospital costs, and lost time from work&#xD;
      if non-procedure management is found to be a non-inferior treatment regimen. The physician&#xD;
      investigators want to tell patients that they know why they are proposing treatments, the&#xD;
      risks and benefits of the treatment, and use evidence to inform these recommendations and the&#xD;
      family's decisions. The proposed trial will compare the effectiveness of alignment under&#xD;
      sedation/anesthesia with simple immobilization for management of displaced DRFs in children,&#xD;
      providing critical data regarding optimal management of this common fracture. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study's primary question is: does anatomic reduction under sedation/anesthesia of DRF result&#xD;
      in improved patient outcomes at six months compared to immobilization without attempted&#xD;
      reduction?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple reasons exist for comparing these treatment strategies for DRF, including: 1) these&#xD;
      are the most common treatments for DRF, 2) the strategies are widely divergent (operative vs.&#xD;
      non-operative), and 3) there is a large potential to change clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and&#xD;
      data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data&#xD;
      anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the&#xD;
      clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected,&#xD;
      documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Conference&#xD;
      on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements&#xD;
      (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source&#xD;
      data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and&#xD;
      inspection by local and regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For specific details regarding quality assurance and quality control, please see the data&#xD;
      management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the&#xD;
      supervision of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the&#xD;
      accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data and patient reported outcomes will be entered into REDCap, a 21 CFR Part&#xD;
      11-compliant data capture system provided by the DCRI. The data system includes password&#xD;
      protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that&#xD;
      appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from&#xD;
      the source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY OVERSIGHT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety oversight will be under the direction of a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)&#xD;
      composed of individuals with the appropriate expertise and knowledge of pediatric orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgery usually obtained via an accredited pediatric orthopaedic fellowship. Members of the&#xD;
      DSMB should be independent from the study conduct and free of conflict of interest, or&#xD;
      measures should be in place to minimize perceived conflict of interest. The DSMB will meet at&#xD;
      least semiannually to assess safety data on each arm of the study. The DMSB will operate&#xD;
      under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at the&#xD;
      organizational meeting of the DSMB. At this time, each data element that the DSMB needs to&#xD;
      assess will be clearly defined. The DSMB will provide its input to NIAMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in PROMIS UE (CAT) at 1 year between arms.&#xD;
      The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were based on detecting a clinically meaningful difference in the&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper extremity computer&#xD;
      adaptive test (CAT) of 4 points. PROMIS measures use a T-score metric with a mean of 50 and&#xD;
      standard deviation of 10 in a reference population. A sample size of 133 per am, assuming a&#xD;
      two-sided type I error rate of 0.05, will provide 90% power to detect a difference between&#xD;
      arms of 4 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conservatively account for 20% lost-to-follow-up or missing data on the primary outcome at&#xD;
      12 months, the investigators have inflated the sample size to 167 per arm, for a total target&#xD;
      enrollment of 334.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded sample size re-estimation based on the standard deviation of the primary outcome,&#xD;
      after 100 participants have completed the 6 month follow-up, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL APPROACH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Statistical Analyses are described in depth in the Statistical Analysis Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will summarize all baseline variables by arm. Specifically, continuous&#xD;
      variables will be summarized using mean and standard deviation, for normally distributed&#xD;
      variables, and median and IQR, for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be summarized with frequency and percentages. There will be no formal hypothesis testing&#xD;
      for comparison of baseline characteristics between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analyses of the primary outcome at 1 year will be assessed with a two-sided type I&#xD;
      error rate of 0.05 for a MCID of 4 points. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction will be&#xD;
      applied to analyses of all secondary outcomes to account for multiplicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis for the primary aim will utilize a mixed effect model for the primary outcome,&#xD;
      PROMIS Upper Extremity Function at 12 months, with a fixed effect for treatment arm and a&#xD;
      random effect for site. Fixed effects will also include all variables considered in the&#xD;
      randomization (site, sex, age), to control for imbalances in both the design and analysis.&#xD;
      Incorporation of a random center effect will allow for separation of between site and within&#xD;
      site variance components. Distributional assumptions will be assessed and transformations or&#xD;
      inclusions of higher order terms may be considered, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will employ similar methods for all secondary continuous outcomes. A&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed effect model with Poisson distribution and log link will be used for&#xD;
      the secondary count outcome, number of revisions, refractures, re-reductions, and&#xD;
      reoperations. Distributional assumptions will be assessed, and a dichotomous version may be&#xD;
      used instead if appropriate (any revisions, refractures, reductions, and reoperations vs&#xD;
      never). Descriptive statistics will be used summarize satisfaction survey by treatment arm.&#xD;
      Simple non-parametric test statistics or chi-squared test statistics may be used to compare&#xD;
      ordinal and binary variables, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses may also consider trajectories of the primary outcome measured over&#xD;
      time. Fixed effects for baseline PROMIS Upper Extremity Function, time, treatment arm, and&#xD;
      the interaction will be included in a linear mixed effect model with random patient nested in&#xD;
      center effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction will be applied to all secondary analyses to account&#xD;
      for multiplicity.&#xD;
