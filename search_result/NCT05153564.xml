  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novo Nordisk is developing a combination therapy with the investigational drug NNC0480-0389&#xD;
      and an already approved medicine called &quot;semaglutide&quot; for the treatment of type-2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D). It is expected that the combination will further improve the blood sugar control&#xD;
      compared to semaglutide therapy alone. The study will investigate the influence of the&#xD;
      combination of semaglutide and NNC0480-0389 on the blood levels of a birth control pill (a&#xD;
      combined oral contraceptive consisting of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) and&#xD;
      paracetamol. Participants will get semaglutide and NNC0480-0389 as injection under the skin&#xD;
      of their belly using a pen-injector. The injections will be given once weekly for 14 weeks.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will at two occasions get paracetamol as soluble tablet in&#xD;
      connection with a standardised breakfast meal. Further, participants will get the birth&#xD;
      control pill in form of tablets in two periods of 8 days each. Participants will get the&#xD;
      combination of semaglutide and NNC0480-0389 as well as paracetamol and the combined&#xD;
      contraceptive in any case. The study participation will last up to about 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will have 25 visits at the study centre. For 4 of the visits participants will&#xD;
      stay at the study centre; the remaining visits will be outpatient. Only healthy&#xD;
      postmenopausal women can take part in this study.&#xD;
