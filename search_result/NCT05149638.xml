  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the cortisol levels that most accurately diagnose a&#xD;
      patient with adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which cortisol levels are too low for&#xD;
      daily living.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test will be conducted by administering&#xD;
      intramuscular cosyntropin into a subject's arm and measuring cortisol levels before and after&#xD;
      injection. Cosyntropin tests are routine medical tests that are done in doctors' offices to&#xD;
      diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Cosyntropin is a synthetic version of a hormone, called ACTH,&#xD;
      that is secreted by our bodies to help produce cortisol. Participation in this research will&#xD;
      last about two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim # 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to accurately re-define the cortisol threshold to diagnose adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency with cosyntropin stimulation test using the Alinity, monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      cortisol assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim # 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to determine a basal, morning, cortisol level above which adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency can be ruled out using the Alinity cortisol assay and to compare diagnostic&#xD;
      cortisol thresholds within the cosyntropin stimulation test between the Abbott Alinity assay&#xD;
      and the Roche 2 assay.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A prospective, cross-sectional study design consisting of one study visit during which the study participant will undergo cosyntropin stimulation test. The three groups in the study are healthy volunteers (HV; n = 30), patients with known primary or central adrenal insufficiency (n = 30), and patients suspected to have primary or central adrenal insufficiency (n = 30).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Healthy volunteers are those 18 years or older without prior diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Study participation by healthy volunteers helps us understand what cortisol levels should be in a healthy population. This information also helps us figure out what levels might be in people with adrenal insufficiency.</description>
