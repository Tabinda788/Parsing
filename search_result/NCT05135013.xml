      Methodology Design. A case-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting. Breast cancer clinic and breast cancer screening unit at clinical oncology&#xD;
      department, Ain Shams University hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases who will be screened from the BC clinic and the BC screening unit will be assessed&#xD;
      for eligibility according to the following inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 70&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed with other concurrent malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prior history of another cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible candidates will be stratified as cases or matched controls as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cases (100) are those eligible patients who were diagnosed with histopathologically&#xD;
           confirmed breast cancer and were during the past 2 years to 2021 (2019-2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Matched controls (100) are those participants presenting to the screening clinic and&#xD;
           were not diagnosed with breast cancer during the past 2 years to 2021 (2019-2020).&#xD;
           Candidates are to be of same range of age (+/-3 years); and similar visiting period&#xD;
           (+/-2 months). All controls were confirmed as having no diagnosis of breast cancer, with&#xD;
           negative findings on physical breast examination, and breast sono-mammographic&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration. The protocol will be approved by the ethical committee of NGU and the&#xD;
      Clinical Oncology department ASU. The study will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for both groups will be done through reviewing of the participants' medical&#xD;
      records retrospectively Data collection will include the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data: name, age, sex, residence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric data: height, weight, waist &amp; hip circumference &amp; waist to hip ratio and&#xD;
           BMI calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female &amp; menopausal status, age at menarche&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history &amp; comorbidity (CVS, DM 1 or 2, HTN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history of other cancers, diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occupational history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social history: smoking, recreational drug use, marital status, nulliparity/multi-parity&#xD;
           and lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary habits and diet composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lifestyle habits and degree of regular activity (sedentary, active, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of hormonal use as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Reason for hormonal use: contraception, fertility promotion, PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Duration of hormonal use&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Type of hormonal drug used: dose, hormone type, route of administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast cancer classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. - Type of pathology - 2- Molecular classification (ER, PR, Her2 receptors status)&#xD;
                3- Staging of BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The frequency distribution of the parameters will be assessed.&#xD;
      Parametric data will be presented as mean &amp; standard deviation, while non parametric data&#xD;
      will be presented as median &amp; IQR. All data will be analyzed using the appropriate&#xD;
      statistical test. Proportions will be presented using number &amp; proportion and will be&#xD;
      assessed by the Chi square.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple logistic regression analysis will be used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and&#xD;
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the various studied factors in relation to&#xD;
      breast cancer occurrence &amp; subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the effect of the combined significant factors to the risk of breast cancer&#xD;
      development will be evaluated.&#xD;
