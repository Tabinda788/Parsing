  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study to test the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the&#xD;
      investigational agent MT-101 in patients with Peripheral T cell Lymphoma. MT-101 is made with&#xD;
      myeloid cells collected from the patient's blood. The myeloid cells are modified and later&#xD;
      infused back into their veins. The modified myeloid cells recognize the tumor cells and are&#xD;
      designed to target and kill them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research study is divided into two parts. The first part will be to determine the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the study drug product. During this part of the study, there will be 3&#xD;
      groups of study patients. The first group of patients will receive a low dose of cells, the&#xD;
      second group will receive a higher dose of cells, and the third group will receive the higher&#xD;
      dose of cells and lymphodepleting chemotherapy to reduce the number of T cells in the blood.&#xD;
      In the second part of the study, cells with or without chemotherapy will be administered&#xD;
      based on results of Part 1 and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MT-101 will be&#xD;
      assessed. All patient groups will receive 6 doses of drug product over 3 weeks.&#xD;
