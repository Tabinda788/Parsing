  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBS is a highly prevalent bowel disorder, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain during&#xD;
      bowel movements or a change in bowel habits. Typically, IBS patients experience constipation,&#xD;
      diarrhoea or a mix of constipation and diarrhoea, as well as symptoms of abdominal bloating&#xD;
      or distension. The chronic and bothersome nature of IBS symptoms negatively affects the&#xD;
      quality of life of many patients. Because there are currently limited medical treatment&#xD;
      options for IBS, it is important to study new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS can (in part) be caused by an 'imbalance' of the bacteria residing in your intestinal&#xD;
      tract. For instance, there may be a lower proportion of specific bacteria that are generally&#xD;
      considered beneficial for our health. The consumption of non-digestible food ingredients,&#xD;
      such as GOS, may stimulate the growth of these beneficial bacteria. GOS is a type of&#xD;
      'prebiotic', which is known to support health and wellbeing of consumers. By restoring the&#xD;
      bacterial balance of the intestinal tract, the symptoms of IBS may be reduced after&#xD;
      consumption of GOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health effects of the study product (a specific GOS) used in current study was previously&#xD;
      investigated in a small group of patients with IBS. Use of the study product indicated a&#xD;
      reduction in the patients' symptoms, improvement in their quality of life, and changes in&#xD;
      their gut bacteria. We therefore hypothesize that GOS / a specific GOS may reduce the symptom&#xD;
      severity of patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we want to further evaluate how GOS may improve symptoms of IBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, 8-week intervention&#xD;
      study, preceded by a 2-week run-in period, to assess the efficacy of GOS on symptom severity&#xD;
      in adult patients with IBS. The study population will consist of 210 adult patients diagnosed&#xD;
      in the past 36 months with IBS-Diarrhoea (N =70), IBS-Constipation (N = 70), or IBS-Mixed (N&#xD;
      =70).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent and multifaceted functional bowel&#xD;
      disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with defecation or a change in&#xD;
      bowel habits in the absence of detectable structural and biochemical abnormalities (Rome IV&#xD;
      Criteria; Lacey et al., 2016). Disordered bowel habits are typically present, such as&#xD;
      constipation, diarrhoea or a mix of constipation and diarrhoea, as are symptoms of abdominal&#xD;
      bloating/distension. The chronic and bothersome nature of IBS symptoms negatively affects&#xD;
      patient quality of life and introduces a substantial economic burden on patients and the&#xD;
      healthcare system. The gut microbiota composition and function may play a pivotal role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of IBS, as a reduction in endogenous bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and&#xD;
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii concentrations, as well as small bowel bacterial overgrowth have&#xD;
      been reported in IBS patients, thereby introducing the gut microbiota as a potential target&#xD;
      for treatment and symptom relief. Intervention with non-digestible food ingredients, such as&#xD;
      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), may form a suitable intervention strategy, as these&#xD;
      'prebiotics' are known to modulate the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and support health&#xD;
      and wellbeing of the host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of GOS has previously been evaluated in patients with IBS, which&#xD;
      demonstrated that GOS may reduce IBS symptom severity, improve quality of life, improve stool&#xD;
      consistency and defecation frequency and alter gut microbiota composition, in a safe manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there are currently limited suitable medical treatments for IBS, this study will evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of GOS in reducing symptom severity of patients with IBS&#xD;
