  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The virtual reality mask is a tool likely to improve the conditions for performing awake&#xD;
      surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  by improving tolerance for the patient,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  by improving ergonomics in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to control the risks as well as possible, the investigators propose to test the&#xD;
      equipment on patients who will undergo orthopedic surgery under local anesthesia at the&#xD;
      hospital of Brest: the patients operated in orthopedics under local anesthesia are immobile&#xD;
      during the procedure. This target population will allow an immersion of the equipment in the&#xD;
      operating room, with an awake patient, during a short time (on average 1 hour of&#xD;
      intervention) and for a technically light interventional procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Study the tolerance of the virtual reality mask on patients in the operating room for orthopedic surgery under loco-regional anesthesia. The mask must be maintained during the testing (minimum 1 hour). The testing consists in the realization, by the patient, of a series of language or neuropsychological tests predefined during the preoperative assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing patient's state of anxiety with the STAI. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a psychological inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis. The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety.</description>
