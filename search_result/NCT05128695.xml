    <textblock>
      Aim of this observational study is to improve our understanding of the impact of Covid-19 on&#xD;
      health. By an online questionnaire at least 60.000 people are invited by email to&#xD;
      participate. Invited are those people who tested for Covid-19 at the Public Health Service&#xD;
      South Limburg since June 2020. Participants are followed over time (open cohort), to study&#xD;
      impact on health, that is physical health, mental health, and social health (longcovid and&#xD;
      other conseauences). Also, the socioeconomic impact is studied, as on work and education. And&#xD;
      the consequences for health-care consumption; it also includes aspects as coping, stigma and&#xD;
      lifestyle. All focused to understand the impact of Covid-19, in relation to health, and to&#xD;
      gain information for promoting positive health and improving prevention and care.&#xD;
