  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-centre randomized controlled trial, with London Health Sciences Centre&#xD;
      (LHSC) as the lead site. Elderly patients with complex ankle fractures who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and provide consent will be randomized (through a web-based randomization system) to&#xD;
      one of the two treatment arms. One group (Group A) will receive primary ankle fusion, and the&#xD;
      second group (Group B) will receive primary ankle open reduction and internal fixation&#xD;
      (ORIF). Patient important outcomes will be compared at one year post injury&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the current time, there are few prospective studies comparing primary ankle arthrodesis&#xD;
      versus Open Reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for the treatment of complex fractures&#xD;
      around the ankle in the frail elderly who have significant co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effective alternative to ORIF that results in improved function, less post-operative pain&#xD;
      and a lower rate of complications is desirable, particularly in the setting of a severely&#xD;
      compromised soft tissue envelope, osteopenia or significant co-morbidities. Emerging clinical&#xD;
      evidence regarding primary ankle fusion is encouraging, suggesting several potential benefits&#xD;
      over ORIF in severely compromised cases including lower post-operative pain scores, improved&#xD;
      functional outcomes, lower complication rates, and high union rates. However, high level&#xD;
      evidence confirming these potential benefits is lacking. The results of the proposed&#xD;
      investigation would have significant implications for the management of orthopaedic trauma&#xD;
      patients with fragility fractures around the ankle and may in fact challenge ORIF as the gold&#xD;
      standard of treatment in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims &amp; Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators aim to compare primary ankle arthrodesis to ORIF for the treatment of&#xD;
      complex fractures around the ankle in the frail elderly. The primary research question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Does primary ankle fusion for the treatment of severe fractures around the ankle in the&#xD;
      frail elderly result in improved outcomes and a lower rate of complications compared with&#xD;
      ORIF?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary fusion will result in improved health related quality of life, functional&#xD;
           outcomes, pain and reduced complications compared to ORIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The null hypothesis is that primary fusion will result in the same post-operative health&#xD;
           related quality of life, functional outcomes, pain, and complication rates relative to&#xD;
           ORIF for severe fractures around the ankle in the frail elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-centre randomized clinical trial (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: London Health Sciences Centre - Victoria Hospital, ON (coordinating centre); other&#xD;
      participating centres to be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: The local research team will screen admissions and clinic lists for eligible&#xD;
      patients who will be characterized and enrolled prospectively over a 2-year period and&#xD;
      followed according to the research ethics board (REB) approved protocol. Full eligibility&#xD;
      will be determined during the primary appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon, following&#xD;
      appropriate radiographic scans, at which point an informed consent discussion will take&#xD;
      place. The local research team will measure and capture outcomes during regularly scheduled&#xD;
      clinic or hospital visits.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-Form 12 (SF-12).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>• The primary outcome will be health related quality of life, measured by the SF-12 at one year post surgery. The SF12 measures patient reported, health related quality of life from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better physical and mental health functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>• Pain will be measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function IndeX (FIX-IT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>• Weight-bearing will be assessed by the FIX-IT score, which provides a simple, standardized and validated approach to assess weight bearing and pain from 0 to 12 with 12 being no pain or weigh-bearing limitations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Euro-Qol-5 Dimension (EQ5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>• Health-related quality of life will also be measured by the EQ5D. The EQ5D measures patient-reported health related quality of life from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best health imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS-Physical Function Short Form (PROMIS-PF), version 10a</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>• Patient-reported function will be measured via the PROMIS-PF Short form, a rigorously developed, patient-centred measure that measures functional ability from 10 to 50, with 50 being no functional limitations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Olerud Molander Ankle Score (OMAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>• Patient-reported, ankle fracture specific functional ability will be measured by the OMAS. The OMAS is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scorings representing better functional ability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extended Timed-up and Go (TUG) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>• Patient mobility will be measured by the Extended TUG test. To ensure that the investigators remain unbiased during the evaluation and follow-up process, the TUG test will be administered by independent assessors blinded to treatment allocation. The TUG test record the amount of time a patient requires to stand from a chair, walk 3 metres, turn and walk back to sit on the chair. The patient is allowed to use their regular walking aids, and the use of walking aids is recorded by the assessor. A shorter time represents better patient mobility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of complications</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>• The rate of complications, including nonunion, malunion, infection, implant failure, arthritis, and re-operation will be captured.</description>
