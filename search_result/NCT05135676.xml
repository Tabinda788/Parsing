  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inpatient management of glycemia in people with diabetes has been inadequately studied.&#xD;
      Previous randomized trials of intensive insulin therapy in the hospital setting resulted in&#xD;
      excessive hypoglycemia. Current ADA guidelines (glucose 140-180 mg/dL) are by consensus with&#xD;
      the upper bound defined by observational data and the lower bound by safety concerns. None of&#xD;
      the previous studies of intensive glucose management used CGM technology. Whether near normal&#xD;
      glucose levels can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia among hospitalized patients&#xD;
      with diabetes with the advent of CGM technology is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are clear associations between hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes hospitalized with infection, including COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased&#xD;
      the urgency to definitively answer the question of whether glucose lowering below 140-180&#xD;
      mg/dL can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this proposed study demonstrates intensive management of glucose to a target of 90 to 130&#xD;
      mg/dL without hypoglycemia is achievable in the inpatient setting with CGM technology, a&#xD;
      larger study could then be performed to evaluate whether there is clinical benefit including&#xD;
      a reduction in morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that glucose management with CGM can achieve a mean glucose&#xD;
      of 90-130 mg/dL without increasing hypoglycemia compared with standard care with a glucose&#xD;
      target of 140-180 mg/dL. Individuals with diabetes who are hospitalized (non-ICU) for an&#xD;
      eligible condition will be randomly assigned to receive standard therapy (glucose target&#xD;
      140-180 mg/dL per ADA guidelines) or intensive therapy (glucose target 90-130 mg/dL and CGM&#xD;
      used for monitoring). Real-time CGM will be used in the Intensive Target Group and masked CGM&#xD;
      will be used in the Standard Target Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-primary outcomes, assessed via a hierarchical approach, include a treatment group&#xD;
      comparison of mean glucose (superiority) followed by a non-inferiority comparison of time &lt;54&#xD;
      mg/dL measured with CGM.&#xD;

      Protocol Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The glucose management team (GMT) at each site will identify potentially eligible&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After informed consent and confirmation of eligibility, each participant will be&#xD;
           randomly assigned to the Standard Target or Intensive Target group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose management in the Standard Target Group will follow the hospital's usual&#xD;
           practice using insulin for glucose management, with a target glucose concentration of&#xD;
           140-180 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - A masked CGM sensor will be worn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose management in the Intensive Target Group will include close monitoring by the&#xD;
           site GMT to maximize the percentage of glucose values in the range of 90 to 130 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Glucose monitoring will include real-time CGM. The hospital's GMT will be the ones&#xD;
                monitoring the CGM data. The information from CGM will be used for future&#xD;
                management changes to insulin delivery and for safety monitoring, particularly for&#xD;
                hypoglycemia. In essence, CGM will be used adjunctively in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CGM validation will occur within 2-6 hours following sensor insertion and must be&#xD;
                within 20% of a blood glucose result of &gt;100 mg/dL for two consecutive blood&#xD;
                glucose measurements. If a blood glucose result is &lt;100 mg/dL, the corresponding&#xD;
                CGM reading must be within 20 mg/dL of the blood glucose value. CGM validation will&#xD;
                occur at least twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin delivery will be based on the site's usual protocol. The hospital nursing staff&#xD;
           will follow their institutional SOPs with respect to frequency of BGM testing and use of&#xD;
           BG test results for administering meal insulin and corrections. The nursing staff will&#xD;
           not be utilizing CGM in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participation will conclude at the time of hospital discharge, 10 days after&#xD;
           randomization, at time of transfer to ICU or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Designated personnel from the Coordinating Center will be responsible for maintaining quality&#xD;
      assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems to ensure that the clinical portion of the&#xD;
      trial is conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the&#xD;
      protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirements, as well as&#xD;
      to ensure that the rights and wellbeing of trial participants are protected and that the&#xD;
      reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable. Eligibility, informed consent,&#xD;
      data entry completion and adverse events will be prioritized for monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source Data Verification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be obtained from the participant, the participant's EHR and from CGM. EHR&#xD;
      data will be either transcribed from the EHR onto eCRFs on the study website or will be&#xD;
      electronically transmitted to the Coordinating Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient Recruitment and Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment will involve identification of hospitalized patients at each clinical center&#xD;
           who meet the study eligibility criteria. There will be no specific efforts to promote&#xD;
           recruitment other than making hospital staff aware of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Enrollment will proceed with the goal of at least 120 participants entering the&#xD;
           randomized trial but no greater than 130. Screening for eligibility will be performed&#xD;
           from medical records prior to informed consent being signed. Thus, once informed consent&#xD;
           is signed, randomization will proceed quickly. Participants who have signed consent may&#xD;
           be permitted to continue into the trial, if eligible, even if the randomization goal has&#xD;
           been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study participants will be recruited from 3-6 clinical centers in the United States. All&#xD;
           eligible participants will be included without regard to sex, race, or ethnicity. There&#xD;
           is no restriction on the number of participants to be enrolled by each site toward the&#xD;
           overall recruitment goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Collection and Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After informed consent has been signed, all potential participants who are females&#xD;
                of child-bearing potential will have a serum or urine pregnancy test if one has not&#xD;
                been done since hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data from the EHR will be recorded in the study database. Medical history&#xD;
                information will include diabetes history, other medical conditions, medications,&#xD;
                height and weight, HbA1c (during hospitalization or most recent prior to&#xD;
                admission), and other relevant laboratory values. The medical condition that&#xD;
                prompted hospital admission will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Recorded for Study (in addition to data collected at enrollment):&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of hospitalization or 10 days from randomization, data to be recorded will&#xD;
           include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and O2 saturation if oxygen is&#xD;
                used)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BGM&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Insulin received each day: type of insulin, route (IV or SQ), # of units&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All medical conditions that developed during the hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Date of transfer to ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medications received&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All coded discharge diagnoses including alive or dead&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Labs (if measured/available) such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  At admission and prior to randomization (if available)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Hematocrit and hemoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Liver function (ALT)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  COVID-19 testing&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All measurements (at admission and while active in the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Creatinine/eGFR&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reporting for Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs possibly related to a study device or study participation and UADEs must be reported to&#xD;
      the Coordinating Center within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. This can&#xD;
      occur via phone or email, or by completion of the online serious adverse event form and&#xD;
      device issue form if applicable. If the form is not initially completed, it should be&#xD;
      competed as soon as possible after there is sufficient information to evaluate the event. All&#xD;
      other reportable ADEs and other reportable AEs should be submitted by completion on the on&#xD;
      line form within 7 days of the site becoming aware of the event. The Coordinating Center will&#xD;
      notify all participating investigators of any adverse event that is serious, related, and&#xD;
      unexpected. Notification will be made within 10 working days after the Coordinating Center&#xD;
      becomes aware of the event. Each principal investigator is responsible for reporting serious&#xD;
      study-related adverse events and abiding by any other reporting requirements specific to&#xD;
      his/her Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee. Where the JCHR IRB is the overseeing&#xD;
      IRB, sites must report all serious, related adverse events within seven calendar days. Upon&#xD;
      receipt of a qualifying event, the Sponsor will investigate the event to determine if a UADE&#xD;
      is confirmed, and if indicated, report the results of the investigation to all overseeing&#xD;
      IRBs, and the FDA within 10 working days of the Sponsor becoming aware of the UADE per 21CFR&#xD;
      812.46(b). The Medical Monitor must determine if the UADE presents an unreasonable risk to&#xD;
      participants. If so, the Medical Monitor must ensure that all investigations, or parts of&#xD;
      investigations presenting that risk, are terminated as soon as possible but no later than 5&#xD;
      working days after the Medical Monitor makes this determination and no later than 15 working&#xD;
      days after first receipt notice of the UADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size has been computed for the treatment group comparison of mean glucose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total sample size was computed to be N=110 for the following assumptions: two randomized&#xD;
      arms, 90% power, a 25 mg/dL difference in mean glucose between treatment groups, SD of 40&#xD;
      mg/dL, and 2-sided type 1 error of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size has been increased to N=120 to account for potential dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For percent of time &lt; 54 mg/dL, statistical power will be &gt;99% for demonstrating&#xD;
      non-inferiority: two randomized arms, a total sample size of N=110, a standard deviation of&#xD;
      1%, no difference, and alpha =0.025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has co-primary outcomes measured using CGM for up to 10 days following&#xD;
      randomization; mean glucose tested between groups for superiority and % time &lt;54 mg/dL tested&#xD;
      to demonstrate non-inferiority of intensive treatment compared with standard treatment. The&#xD;
      intervention will be considered effective only if both endpoints are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null/alternative hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mean Glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in mean glucose between Standard and&#xD;
                Intensive groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Alternative Hypothesis: The mean glucose is different in the Standard and Intensive&#xD;
                groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percent Time &lt;54 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Null Hypothesis: There is an absolute mean difference of at least 1% in the percent&#xD;
                time &lt;54 mg/dL between the Intensive and Standard group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Alternative Hypothesis: There is an absolute mean difference of less than 1% in the&#xD;
                percent time &lt;54 mg/dL between the Intensive and Standard groups.&#xD;
