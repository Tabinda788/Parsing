  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder defined by&#xD;
      repetitive episodes of apnea and hypopnea. These traits include anatomical&#xD;
      (narrow/crowded/collapsible upper airway) and nonanatomical (waking up too easily during&#xD;
      airway narrowing [a low respiratory arousal threshold], ineffective or reduced pharyngeal&#xD;
      dilator muscle activity during sleep, and unstable ventilatory control [high loop gain])&#xD;
      components. Oropharyngeal training reduces the snoring times, Apnea-hypopnea Index (AHI) and&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness. There is lack of good evaluating tools to distinguish different&#xD;
      phenotypes of OSA and the efficacy of combined therapy. The purposes of our study are (1) to&#xD;
      evaluate OSA patient by using Polysomonogrphy (PSG), force sensing resistor (FRS), Drug&#xD;
      induce sleep endoscopy (DISE) and CT and muscle strength testing, (2) to know the exercise&#xD;
      times by using FSR and (3) the efficacy of exercise in different groups.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are newly diagnosed with mild to severe OSA (AHI &gt;5/h), and the physician will&#xD;
      explain the treatment programs to every subject. By the result of muscle strength testing,&#xD;
      the subjects will be classified as low muscle strength and normal groups. The myofunctional&#xD;
      therapy program will begin at 6 week after surgery, and subjects will undergo 12 weeks of the&#xD;
      home-based oropharyngeal myofunctional therapeutic training. During the training intervention&#xD;
      period, subjects will be interviewed one time per week for adjusting the treatment intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results：The hypothesis of this study is the efficacy of exercise would be less in&#xD;
      the low muscle strength OSA patient than normal.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) at post op 6 weeks and 18 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DISE was carried out by an experienced ENT surgeon in a semi-dark and quiet operating room with the patient supine lying on a hospital bed. Artificial sleep was induced by intravenous injection of propofol and midazolam (bolus injection of 1.5 mg) through a target-controlled infusion system (1.5 to 3.0 lg/mL), intending to the transition to unconsciousness with beginning of snoring and with the examiner evaluating decreased muscle reflexes of the eyelid. The severity of collapse in the upper airway was assessed by the surgeon.</description>
