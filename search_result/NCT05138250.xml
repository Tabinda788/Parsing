  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to recruit 32 people with COPD who have frequent exacerbations and high&#xD;
      eosinophil counts which indicates &quot;asthmatic type&quot; inflammation and treat them for a year&#xD;
      with mepolizumab. This is a licenced medication for asthma. Mepolizumab is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that acts through interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonism to reduce blood eosinophil levels&#xD;
      and is effective at reducing exacerbations in asthmatics. To determine whether mepolizumab&#xD;
      may be an effective treatment in people with COPD and &quot;asthmatic type&quot; inflammation&#xD;
      participants will have MRI scans before the treatment, after 12 weeks and after a year to see&#xD;
      how the drug affects inflammation. The investigators will also compare our measurements with&#xD;
      the number of exacerbations people get (measured by diaries), with measures of their quality&#xD;
      of life (using a questionnaire), and with ordinary laboratory breathing tests. The&#xD;
      investigators are especially interested to know if the reduction in inflammation early on&#xD;
      after 12 weeks is associated with fewer exacerbations and better quality of life over the&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of COPD as determined by a post bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;70% and an FEV1 of&#xD;
             between 20 and 80% at screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with inhaled triple therapy (licensed combination of long acting beta 2&#xD;
             agonist, long acting anti-muscarinic and corticosteroid) at constant dose for at least&#xD;
             12 weeks before screening visit. Treatment with roflumilast, theophyillines and&#xD;
             macrolides will be permitted so long as they were introduced at stable dose &gt; 12 weeks&#xD;
             prior to screening visit. (If maintenance drug dosing has not been with stable dosages&#xD;
             for 12 weeks the screening visit may be rescheduled until this is achieved: see&#xD;
             sections 7.3 and 7.10)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 2 acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) requiring treatment with oral steroids&#xD;
             and/or antibiotics in the last 12 months, or 1 acute AECOPD requiring hospital&#xD;
             admission in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one eosinophil count of &gt;0.3 cells·μL-1 in the 12 months prior to screening&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning, including Gadovist (ie hypersensitivity or poor&#xD;
             renal function; see below); this includes claustrophobia and musculoskeletal&#xD;
             difficulties, this information is collected on the UoS MRI unit screening form.&#xD;

             4 weeks of screening. A repeat screening visit may be scheduled in order to achieve&#xD;
             this criterion. The participant will be required to successfully complete all&#xD;
             screening procedures at the rescheduled visit, including that for exacerbation-free&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Chronic liver disease (Any elevation of ALT above twice the upper limit of normal at&#xD;
             screening. Lower levels of abnormality are permitted after investigator review if felt&#xD;

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Of childbearing potential and not willing to use highly effective methods of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received an investigational drug within 30 days of first dose,&#xD;
             or within 5 drug half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer&#xD;
