    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB104 in&#xD;
      healthy Japanese and non-Japanese participants. The secondary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple, oral doses of BIIB104 administered twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) for 9 days, with an additional dose occurring in the morning on Day 10 in healthy&#xD;
      Japanese and non-Japanese participants.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening up to Day 25</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event), requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>
