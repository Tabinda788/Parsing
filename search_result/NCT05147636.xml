  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extubation in intensive care unit is a risky situation. Its failure is associated with an&#xD;
      increase in the duration of mechanical ventilation and high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the extubation procedure associating prior endotracheal aspiration&#xD;
      followed by ablation of the intubation probe under the application of a PEEP, would make it&#xD;
      possible both to avoid the leakage of secretions towards the lower airways and the alveolar&#xD;
      recruitment, compared to extubation with concomitant endotracheal aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By these mechanisms, this extubation procedure combining prior endotracheal aspiration&#xD;
      followed by ablation of the tube under the application of a PEEP, would make it possible to&#xD;
      increase the ventilator free days from any mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extubation consists of several distinct phases: obtaining the weaning criteria, succeeding&#xD;
      weaning test and then removing the intubation tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the first two stages are the subject of numerous publications, the last one is rarely&#xD;
      studied. To reduce the risk of failure of extubation, the scientific societies of intensive&#xD;
      care medicine have published recommendations. They relate to patient weaning and weaning&#xD;
      testing, but there are no clear recommendations for the procedure for removing the intubation&#xD;
      tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ablation of the tube, performed by the chest physiotherapist or nurse, typically involves&#xD;
      endotracheal aspiration, from deflation of the cuff to removal of the intubation tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is theoretically to prevent the secretions accumulated above the cuff, at the&#xD;
      pharyngeal level, from falling into the lower airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data show that inhalation of secretions appears to be greater during ablation of&#xD;
      the tube with concomitant endotracheal aspiration, which creates a reverse pressure gradient,&#xD;
      propelling the secretions into the lower airways. The application of Positive Expiratory&#xD;
      Pressure during the ablation of the tube would help to combat this phenomenon. At the same&#xD;
      time, this Positive Expiratory Pressure could have a beneficial effect on alveolar&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work proves the non-inferiority of the ablation of the tube with the application of a&#xD;
      Positive Expiratory Pressure versus the so-called &quot;reference&quot; method, consisting of&#xD;
      endotracheal aspiration during the ablation of the tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to conduct a comparative, prospective, randomized, multicenter study comparing&#xD;
      extubation with concomitant endotracheal aspiration versus ablation of the intubation tube&#xD;
      under the application of a PEEP.&#xD;
