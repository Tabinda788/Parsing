  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are common in patients with schizophrenia, and&#xD;
      do not respond well to antipsychotics. The effective treatments for negative symptoms and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment are still to be explored. rTMS is a safe and non-invasive physical&#xD;
      treatment, some studies has been indicated that the high frequency rTMS could increase the&#xD;
      excitability of cortex, and has potentials to improve negative symptoms and cognitive&#xD;
      function in schizophrenia.Therefore, this study is designed to explore the potential benefits&#xD;
      of rTMS, using iTBS pattern, on negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are two core symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and do not respond well to antipsychotics. There are many researches on the&#xD;
      biological mechanism of these two symptoms, and some studies indicated that these two&#xD;
      symptoms maybe related to the dysfunction of prefrontal cortex and deficiency of dopamine.&#xD;
      rTMS is a safe and non-invasive physical treatment, some studies has been indicated that the&#xD;
      high frequency rTMS could increase the excitability of cortex, and has potentials to improve&#xD;
      negative symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia.Therefore, this study is designed&#xD;
      to explore the efficacy of rTMS, using iTBS pattern, on negative symptoms and cognitive&#xD;
      deficits in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial. Patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia will be randomly treated with iTBS or sham condition to the bilateral&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for continuous 10 days, and the follow-ups are set at baseline&#xD;
      and the 11th day. The main outcome measures include the change in MCCB score, PANSS score and&#xD;
      EEG data.&#xD;

    <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery,It can be used for cognitive assessment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other neuropsychiatric diseases,The MCCB covers seven cognitive domains including attention, information processing speed, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, spatial working memory, reasoning, problem solving, and social cognition. The working memory domain does not include verbal working memory because the Chinese language would not make feasible the inclusion of the LNS test.</description>

    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Symptm Scale(PANSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 10days</time_frame>
    <description>The scale to assess the severity of symptoms in schizophrenia.It is an evaluation scale of 30 disparate items scored from 1 to 7 for psychopathological symptoms observed in patients presenting psychotic syndromes, especially schizophrenic states.Three scores obtained with this scale are generally calculated for evaluating three dimensions of the syndrome: positive, negative and general psychopathology, as part of a categorial or dimensional perspective.The minimum value is 30 points, and the maximum value is 210 points.The higher the score, the more severe the relevant symptom is.</description>
