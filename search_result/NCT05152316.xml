  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of exogenous surfactant therapy has significantly improved the mortality in&#xD;
      preterm infants born between 23- and 28-weeks of gestation. However, the therapy has not&#xD;
      affected the prevalence of sequelae such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD] and it may be&#xD;
      argued that it has actually increased. BPD is a lung condition that affects up to 40% of&#xD;
      premature babies born between 23 and 28 weeks gestational age. The prevalence of BPD&#xD;
      decreases with increasing gestational age but can affect infants born at term who have&#xD;
      required mechanical ventilation. It is most commonly defined based on the need for oxygen&#xD;
      past 36 weeks post-menstrual age [PMA]. The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and&#xD;
      involves a complex balance between the underdeveloped lungs, infection, inflammation, oxygen&#xD;
      toxicity and ventilator induced injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to develop a greater understanding of the interactions&#xD;
      between the inflammatory markers present in endotracheal aspirates [ETA] and serum of preterm&#xD;
      infants and surfactant components (including surfactant protein D-SP-D levels) in the lungs&#xD;
      and in the serum of preterm ventilated infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit infants born between 23+0 and 29+6 weeks of gestation at&#xD;
      University College London Hospital admitted to the neonatal unit, who are at risk of&#xD;
      developing respiratory distress syndrome [RDS] and progression to BPD. The investigators plan&#xD;
      to study the correlation between the concentrations of surfactant components (in particular&#xD;
      SP-D) and inflammatory markers in infants across the range of gestations specified. In order&#xD;
      to do this, the investigators will obtain gastric aspirates, endotracheal aspirates [ETA] and&#xD;
      blood samples at birth, 24hrs and days 2 through to day 7 from participants. ETA will only be&#xD;
      obtained if the infants are intubated and ventilated, collected by a standard technique&#xD;
      routinely used in nursing care of ventilated babies using 1-2mls of saline.ETA and blood&#xD;
      samples will then be analysed for levels of surfactant proteins in particular SP-D and&#xD;
      inflammatory and immunological markers [cell counts of neutrophils, macrophages, MMPs,&#xD;
      neutrophil elastase, IL-8, IL-6, IL 11 and IL-1]. This will allow us to map the influence of&#xD;
      SP-D on pro and anti-inflammatory markers that have a role in the inflammatory component of&#xD;
      BPD in these infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will also be collected at specified time points correlating with the plasma,&#xD;
      gastric aspirates and endotracheal aspirates. The investigators aim to correlate clinical&#xD;
      ventilatory parameters, infection factors and maternal factors with the inflammatory and&#xD;
      surfactant protein profiles. In addition, the investigators will apply the international&#xD;
      neonatal consortium Neonatal Adverse severity scores to gain a better understanding of the&#xD;
      baseline incidence of adverse events in premature infants that are admitted to a neonatal&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
