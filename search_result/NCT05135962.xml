      The aim of the current study was to evaluate maxillary and mandibular arch widths' response&#xD;
      to five different appliances and clinical protocols (Rapid maxillary expander RME, Leaf&#xD;
      Expander 450g, Leaf Expander 900g, Self-expander 450g, Self-expander 900g) for the correction&#xD;
      of the maxillary deficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maxillary expansion with fixed appliance is a well-known and consolidated practice in&#xD;
      clinical orthodontics but current findings of &quot;evidence-based dentistry&quot; have not yet&#xD;
      identified a better clinical expansion protocol. This issue is due both to the several&#xD;
      expansion screws available on the market and to the different screw activation protocols,&#xD;
      which could be grouped in rapid and slow, with several customizations. The comparison between&#xD;
      slow and rapid expansion is a hotly debated topic in the literature and a recent systematic&#xD;
      review have shown that both rapid and slow expansion protocols are clinically effective on&#xD;
      the primary outcome (the resolution of the maxillary deficiency and crossbite with a&#xD;
      significant increase of skeletal transversal maxillary dimension). Based on these results,&#xD;
      the choice of appliance based on its ability to solve the maxillary constriction may not be&#xD;
      any more the main selection criteria. The choice of the orthodontist should also be based on&#xD;
      the timing and on a &quot;patient-oriented&quot; device, that minimizes the side effects, such as e.g.&#xD;
      appliance breakages, functional impairments, and pain perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate and analyze five different maxillary expansion&#xD;
      appliances to identify an effective and efficient clinical protocol for the maxillary&#xD;
      expansion.&#xD;

    <description>Leaf expander: The screw delivers a maximum expansion of 6 or 9 mm by activating (compressing) the spring, which generates a light (450g or 900g) and constant force. The leaves are preactivated in the laboratory to deliver 3mm of expansion. Reactivation is performed in the office by 10 quarter-turns (leaf 450g) or 15 quarter-turns (leaf 900g) of the screw per month until expansion has been completed. After active expansion the Leaf Expander is maintained passively in place for retention period. Leaf expander was kept on teeth as a passive retainer and removed after one year from its application.</description>
