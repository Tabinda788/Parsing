    <textblock>
      Central sensitization (CS) is a common feature in chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions&#xD;
      including rheumatoid arthritis, chronic whiplash syndrome, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular&#xD;
      joint disorders, low back pain and lateral elbow pain. CS is defined as &quot;an amplification of&#xD;
      neural signaling within the central nervous system that elicits pain hypersensitivity&quot;.&#xD;
      Clinical signs are allodynia, hyperalgesia and widespread pain, originating from the enhanced&#xD;
      activity of central nervous system to peripheral afferent input from unimodal and polymodal&#xD;
      receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CS not only induces abnormal pain processing, it may also lead to motor performance&#xD;
      dysfunction in chronic pain population. CS induce cortical reorganization including changes&#xD;
      in gray matter, cortical representation and cortical excitability both in motor and&#xD;
      somatosensory cortex. This process ultimately generates sensorimotor conflict that described&#xD;
      as a mismatch between motor intention and sensory feedback, and may directly effect on motor&#xD;
      performance. The structural changes in basal ganglia and reduced GABAergic activity in the&#xD;
      motor cortex contribute to the alteration of the motor performance. It has been known that CS&#xD;
      and fatigue, another indicator of the motor performance, has a bidirectional effect and&#xD;
      fatigue is predicted by CS, independently of the presence of pain. CS affect fatigue via&#xD;
      causing disrupted reward process, increased effort and pain expactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased cervical spine hypersensitivity in patients with LEP even if there is no&#xD;
      accompanied neck or upper limb pain may also indicate of the fatigue as pain does not always&#xD;
      suggest an injury and biomechanical damage to a tissue does not always suggest that an&#xD;
      individual will experience pain. If neck muscle fatigue is effected by central sensitization&#xD;
      in patients with LEP, it can be important to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent neck&#xD;
      muscle fatigue as there is a relationship between fatigue and increased risk of injury.&#xD;
      Despite the fact that central sensitization effect on neck pain has been well documented in&#xD;
      patients with LEP, its role on fatigue had not gain enough clinical and research attention.&#xD;
      To know about central sensitization effect on motor performance can also be useful for&#xD;
      determine subgroup of population who have central sensitization. However, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether remote body endurance alteration occur in lateral elbow pain or not.&#xD;

      EMG assessment Electrode Placement Before electrode placement, the skin will be cleaned with&#xD;
      alcohol to reduce skin impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sternocleidomastoid Muscle (SCM) Electrode Placement Electrodes will be placed to the the&#xD;
      sternal head of the SCM while participants were sitting in a erect position. A line will be&#xD;
      drawn from the sternal notch to the mastoid process and marked at 1/3 of the distance from&#xD;
      the sternal notch. Electrodes initially will placed adjacent to the this point with 20 mm&#xD;
      apart and over the muscle belly based on the muscle palpation during manually resisted neck&#xD;
      flexion contractions. This location is anticipated to place between the innervation zone and&#xD;
      the tendon. In supine, the head will be placed in a neutral anatomic position that&#xD;
      craniocervical and cervical spine is in a mid position. It will be ensured visually by&#xD;
      examiner that cervical spine is in the neutral position which means from the middle of the&#xD;
      subject's forehead to the middle of the chin is horizontal and a line bisecting the neck&#xD;
      longitudinally is parallel to the treatment plinth. Participants will asked to completely&#xD;
      relax in this position. For normalization, isometric neck flexor contraction will be carried&#xD;
      out in supine position via applying manual resistance on frontal region by gradually&#xD;
      increasing force that reached maximum force level in 2 second and then contracted maximally&#xD;
      for 5 second. This procedure will be repeated 3 times with a 30 second time interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper Trapezius (UT) Muscle Electrode Placement Electrodes will be attached 20% laterally to&#xD;
      the midpoint between the dorsal processes of C4 and the posterior lateral third of the&#xD;
      clavicle. For normalization, manual resistance will be given neck extensor while participant&#xD;
      lying in prone position. Contraction will be lasted 5 second for 3 times with 30 interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After electrode placement, a 5 seconds rest recording will be performed for eliminating basal&#xD;
      noise from recording. During the endurance test, participants will asked not to cough, laugh&#xD;
      or talk and head position will be controlled by inclinometer adapted to EMG system.&#xD;
      Participants will be given 3 minutes resting time between neck flexor/extensor endurance&#xD;
      tests for the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck Flexor Endurance Test An examiner will place her hand under the occiput of the&#xD;
      participant, while the participant is lying in supine position with the knees bend and the&#xD;
      arms resting on the abdomen. Cranicervical flexion will be taught to the participants. For&#xD;
      this, participants will asked to place tongue on roof of the mouth, with lips together and&#xD;
      teeth slightly apart while cervical spine is in neutral position. Participants will not be&#xD;
      allowed to open mouth during the test. Participants will be requested to perform gentle head&#xD;
      nodding as if saying &quot;yes&quot; via sliding head in caudal and cephalic directions on the bed and&#xD;
      concentrate feeling of back of the head. After learning of the craniocervical flexion, the&#xD;
      participant will be requested to head off from the examiners hand (approximately 2.5 cm from&#xD;
      the plint) vhile maintaining the craniocervical flexion and then sustain this position as&#xD;
      long as possible. The holding time will be recorded with a stopwatch. The test will be ended&#xD;
      once the participant is unable to hold their head in a correct position that chances occur&#xD;
      more than 5 degree for more than one second, can no longer maintain craniocervical flexion or&#xD;
      head position due to fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck Extensor Endurance Test Participants will be asked to lie in a prone position&#xD;
      maintaining thoracal extension with a strap at the level of T6, arms in their side and head&#xD;
      is end of the plinth. The subject's head and neck will be positioned in a comfortable neutral&#xD;
      position with the chin retracted. 2 kg weight will be placed around the participants head.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to sustain this position as long as possible after removing&#xD;
      support from the head. The test will be ended when the participant can no longer sustain a&#xD;
      correct position or when the head position changes more than 5 degrees. The holding time will&#xD;
      be recorded with a stopwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental pain induction: Temporal Summation Then participants will be asked to seat in a&#xD;
      comfortable position placing their volar faces of the tested dominant arm in elbow flexion on&#xD;
      a table during the experiment. The tested area will be marked with a pen to apply every&#xD;
      stimulus in the same place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal summation will be evoked in a predetermined area:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ECRL muscle origin: Distal humerus supracondylar ridge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECRB muscle belly: identified with resisted radial wrist flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Brachioradialis: 2 cm distal from in the middle of the line extend from lateral&#xD;
           epicondyle to middle of the fossa cubiti via identifying resisted elbow flexion in 90Â°&#xD;
           elbow flexion and wrist in neutral position Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) will be&#xD;
           identified two times with a 30 s interval for each predetermined area via applying&#xD;
           circular probe in a perpendicular direction with an increasing pressure at a rate of&#xD;
           approximately 1 kg/s. PPTs will be recorded when the sensation of the mechanical&#xD;
           pressure stimulus changes into the first painful sensation. The average of two&#xD;
           measurements will be used as a PPTs value. Temporal summation was induced two minutes&#xD;
           after last PPTs was recorded. To evoke temporal summation at the lateral elbow, the&#xD;
           probe will be applied with the pressure of the predefined PPT threshold at the rate of&#xD;
           approximately 2 kg/s where it will be maintained for 1 s before being released with a 1&#xD;
           s interstimulus interval (ISI). This procedure will be repeated 10 times in each&#xD;
           predetermined area. Pain intensity will be asked to participants at first, fifth and&#xD;
           tenth pulse using a Visual Analog Scale range from &quot;0 indicate no pain&quot; to &quot;10 most&#xD;
           painful&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Group: After flexor and extensor endurance test, participants will be provided 20&#xD;
      minutes resting time. PPTs value will be evaluted once in each predetermined region with a 30&#xD;
      s interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before PPTs assessment in predetermined area on lateral elbow, a familirisation session for&#xD;
      the perceived PTTs by participants will be performed on palm of the non dominant arm for each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
