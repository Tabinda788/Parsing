      Introduction: Low back pain is a musculoskeletal disorder that is associated with symptoms&#xD;
      such as pain, limitation of joint range and postural problems in athletes. Methods: The study&#xD;
      design is a randomized controlled clinical trial with a minimum of 35 elite gymnasts with&#xD;
      back pain. Two postural treatments will be implemented, Mezieres Method and Isostretching to&#xD;
      verify if there is improvement of back pain in gymnasts and to compare both procedures.&#xD;
      Discussion: This trial could generate a greater understanding of the importance of posture&#xD;
      related to low back pain and its possible treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial with two groups (intervention and placebo) will be&#xD;
      implemented. The intervention group will have the Mezieres technique as postural treatment&#xD;
      while the placebo group will follow a total of 6 isostretching positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, the two treatments with 30 minutes and duration or with a frequency of 2 weekly&#xD;
      sessions will be implemented for a period of 12 weeks. All treatments will be performed by&#xD;
      the same certified therapist and with a minimum of 5 years of experience in postural&#xD;
      treatments. The measurements will be made immediately after the first session, in 2 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks and in the last week of intervention by a blind researcher who did not participate in&#xD;
      the treatments, but with experience in this field.&#xD;
