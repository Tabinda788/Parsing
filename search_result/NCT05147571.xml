      To demonstrate that the RNS System for thalamic stimulation is safe and effective as an&#xD;

      of age or older who have drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NeuroPace is sponsoring the NAUTILUS Study with the RNS System for thalamic stimulation as an&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy for the treatment of generalized seizures in individuals 12 years of age&#xD;
      or older who have drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy. The RNS System is currently&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for use in patients 18 years and older with hard-to-treat partial-onset&#xD;
      seizures. The same device will be used in the NAUTILUS Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, sham stimulation&#xD;
      controlled pivotal study and participants will be followed for two years after placement of&#xD;
      the RNS System. The study will enroll a maximum of 100 participants within the United States&#xD;
      to ensure that at least 80 participants are implanted with the RNS System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design includes a two-month retrospective and one-month prospective baseline. All&#xD;
      participants will have detection enabled at the time of implant. At one month post-implant,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 1:1 to Active or Sham stimulation. For those randomized to&#xD;
      the Active group, stimulation will be enabled. Participants will be blinded to their own&#xD;
      randomization status until the 2nd GTC occurs for that individual, they completed the 9-month&#xD;
      Effectiveness Evaluation Period (12-months post-implant), or the 60th GTC-event occurs in the&#xD;
      group, whichever occurs first. After that, patients will be unblinded and patients in the&#xD;
      Sham group (responsive stimulation OFF) will have responsive stimulation enabled (responsive&#xD;
      stimulation ON).&#xD;

    <description>The RNS System provides closed loop responsive brain stimulation. The Neurostimulator monitors the electrical activity of the brain to detect abnormal activity that could lead to a seizure. If abnormal activity is detected, the neurostimulator delivers electrical stimulation to the brain through the leads to help prevent the seizure before it occurs.</description>
