  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HotFacets study is a randomized, controlled, cross-over meal study that investigates the&#xD;
      acute effects of alcohol consumption on short-chain fatty acids dynamics, energy metabolism,&#xD;
      and biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the negative health consequences of chronic alcohol abuse, observational and cohort&#xD;
      studies associate moderate alcohol consumption with a 20-30 % lower risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (CVD) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), compared to abstainers. Based on the&#xD;
      J-shaped relationship between alcohol intake and the risk of cardiometabolic diseases, Â½-2&#xD;
      standard drinks/day can be considered as moderate alcohol consumption. The interpretation of&#xD;
      the J-shaped relationship has been criticized mainly due to potential confounding from the&#xD;
      selected reference group and uncontrolled lifestyle factors. Longer, well-designed randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials are lacking to infer causality and to clarify the mechanism of action for&#xD;
      the acute and chronic effects of moderate alcohol consumption on cardiometabolic health and&#xD;
      energy homeostasis. However, some aspects of alcohol metabolism and biomarker validation&#xD;
      could inform such a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HotFacets is set to generate insight into the effects of acute alcohol intake on SCFA&#xD;
      dynamics in blood, urine, and faeces; into the dose-response relationship with REE,&#xD;
      thermogenesis, substrate oxidation, and alcohol biomarkers; and to explore potential low&#xD;
      levels of alcohol produced in the gut.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, four times cross-over, single-blinded, meal study with 24 healthy&#xD;
      fasting subjects will be conducted with a) placebo (water), b) a metabolic acetate generator&#xD;
      (triacetin), and c) a half or d) one unit of isotope labelled ethanol, provided in a&#xD;
      randomized order. Volunteers will be confined in a metabolic chamber overnight before each&#xD;
      test drink (in 250mL water with lemon and juniper taste) and energy production and&#xD;
      expenditure will be measured initially using seven ventilated hood measurements. After the&#xD;
      test drinks and ventilated hood measurements an ad libitum lunch will be served before the&#xD;
      participants will be admitted to the metabolic chamber, where metabolic measurements will be&#xD;
      continued until the following day. Participants will go through a 2-week run-in period before&#xD;
      each test drink and a 2-week wash out period afterwards, both with alcohol abstention. From&#xD;
      two days before the test day in each period until one day after the test days, standardized&#xD;
      foods will be provided. Anthropometrics, DXA, heart rate, blood pressure and all movements&#xD;
      will be recorded before and/or during the test days. Before, during, and after the test day&#xD;
      repeated biological samples (i.e., urine, blood, feces, hair) will be collected. The study&#xD;
      will be divided into a pre-trial (8 subjects, 50-75y) and a main trial (16 subjects, 25-75y).&#xD;
