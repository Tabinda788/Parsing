    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of THE-630 in participants&#xD;
      with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called THE-630, an orally administered KIT tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor. The study will be conducted in two parts: a dose escalation phase, followed&#xD;
      by an expansion phase. The patient population of the initial dose escalation phase (Phase 1)&#xD;
      of the trial will include patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST. Patients must have&#xD;
      disease progression on or be intolerant to imatinib therapy and have also received at least 1&#xD;
      of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, ripretinib, or avapritinib. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the dose escalation phase is to determine the safety profile of oral THE-630, including&#xD;
      the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase&#xD;
      2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a recommended dose has been determined in the escalation phase, the expansion phase&#xD;
      (Phase 2) will enroll 4 cohorts of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST defined by&#xD;
      prior therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST who have progressed on or are&#xD;
           intolerant to imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib and ripretinib (≥5th Line).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST who have progressed on or are&#xD;
           intolerant to imatinib, sunitinib and 0-1 additional lines of therapy in the&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic setting but have not received ripretinib (3rd-4th Line, ripretinib&#xD;
           naive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST who have progressed on or are&#xD;
           intolerant to imatinib, ripretinib and 0-1 additional lines of therapy in the&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic setting (3rd-4th Line, ripretinib exposed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: Patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST who have progressed on or are&#xD;
           intolerant to imatinib (including in the adjuvant setting) and who have not received&#xD;
           additional systemic therapy for advanced GIST (2nd Line).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of orally administered THE-630 will continue to be assessed in&#xD;
      the expansion cohorts. However, the primary objective of the expansion component of the trial&#xD;
      is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of THE-630 in these GIST patient populations.&#xD;

             assessment of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might&#xD;
             compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the drug.&#xD;
