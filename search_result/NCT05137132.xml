  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has over decades showed that marine food carries nutritional characteristics that&#xD;
      promote human health. As seen in epidemiological studies and based on in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      studies, it is hypothesized that unrefined salmon oil as dietary supplement have&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect. However, there is sufficient preliminary data to indicate bioactive&#xD;
      compounds effect for clinical use, and further clinical trials investigating effect are&#xD;
      needed. This trial will investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect in adults&#xD;
      diagnosed with asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial investigating unrefined&#xD;
      salmon oil, CARDIO®, additional to standard care for asthmatics. The investigational product&#xD;
      is an unrefined salmon oil based soft-gel formulation containing 21 different fatty acids&#xD;
      (more than 99.1%), lipopeptides (less than 0.9%), antioxidants and other micro metabolites.&#xD;
      Research has shown that marine foods carry nutritional characteristics that promote human&#xD;
      health, particularly the high intake of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA),&#xD;
      eicosapentaeonic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Cell culture and mice studies&#xD;
      have reported a reduction in leucocytes infiltration of the lungs and decreased&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines with the consumption of the n-3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA. However,&#xD;
      clinical trials in humans diagnosed with asthma, have shown varied results investigating n-3&#xD;
      PUFA supplementation. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether CARDIO® has an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect preventing exacerbation, in enhanced asthma control and quality of&#xD;
      life. Data will be collected by pulmonary function tests (PEF, spirometry and FeNO), blood&#xD;
      sample, nutritional log, quality of life questionnaires (ACQ-5), and blood and stool&#xD;
      collected for research biobanking. Study intervention period will be 20 weeks, plus 4 weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention follow-up, foremost of safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical power calculations assure a recruitment of a sufficient number of patients to&#xD;
      allow the detection of significant changes if any exist.&#xD;

    <description>The comparison of the rate of exacerbations between treatment groups: Best standard care (BSC) + CARDIO®, and BSC + placebo. Exacerbations will be defined as severe event (requiring oral corticosteroids, or hospitalization) or moderate events defined using a composite index. Composite index are calculated using composite variable set as PEF, reliever use of SABA, day time symptoms and night-time awakenings. Measurement one og twice a day from day 0 (baseline) to 20 weeks, depending on different variables. Measurement achieved at participants resident with delivered PEF -equipment and digital platform (application (APP)) designed for self-reporting measurement.</description>
