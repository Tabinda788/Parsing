  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the R0 resection rate of tislelizumab combined with&#xD;
      Lenvatinib and Gemox chemotherapy in the conversion therapy of potentially resectable locally&#xD;
      advanced BTC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Translational therapy refers to methods such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
      targeted and combined therapy to shrink tumors, reduce tumor biological behavior, and achieve&#xD;
      secondary resection. The success rate of transformation depends on the objective response&#xD;
      rate of the treatment method (Objective response rate, ORR). The latest review showed that&#xD;
      132 patients with unresectable ICC had undergone chemotherapy, chemoembolization,&#xD;
      radiotherapy embolization or combination therapy, and 27 patients received downgrade&#xD;
      resection. The research of our group using PD-1 antibody combined with lenvatinib and Gemox&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of unresectable advanced cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
      (NCT03951597, 2020ESMO, 2021ASCO) showed that the ORR was 80% and the disease control rate&#xD;
      (DCR) It reached 93.3% (28/30), of which 3 cases underwent successful radical resection after&#xD;
      downstage. These data suggest that PD1 monoclonal antibody combined with lenvatinib and Gemox&#xD;
      chemotherapy may be an ideal conversion therapy for patients with potentially resectable&#xD;
      advanced biliary system tumors, but there is currently no evidence-based basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores the efficacy and safety of PD1 monoclonal antibody combined with&#xD;
      Lenvatinib and Gemox chemotherapy in potentially resectable advanced BTC conversion therapy.&#xD;
      It has certain clinical significance in order to increase the R0 surgical resection rate of&#xD;
      BTC patients and improve patient survival.&#xD;
