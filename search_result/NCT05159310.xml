  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and compare the efficacy of 2 commonly-used methods of fracture&#xD;
      immobilisation: (1) Fiberglass cast, and (2) Thermoplastic splint. Both these devices are&#xD;
      externally applied and provide pain relief while immobilising the fracture in an acceptable&#xD;
      position. Casts and splints are both established devices in routine clinical use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Casts and splints are both established methods of treating DRF. Casts have been traditionally&#xD;
      the gold standard for non-operative care of fractures, but there are distinct disadvantages&#xD;
      such as skin rash and pruritus, malodour, skin maceration and loosening as the initial&#xD;
      swelling subsides. Casts require specialized tools for removal and they have to be reapplied&#xD;
      by specialized staff if the casts become loose or wet. Splints have the advantage of being&#xD;
      removable and therefore facilitate hygiene and provide a better fit because of the adjustable&#xD;
      straps. Splints are theoretically less rigid and patient non-compliance because of the ease&#xD;
      of removal may result in a greater likelihood of fracture displacement. However, it is known&#xD;
      that fractures displace even in casts and the efficacy of casts at maintaining reduction over&#xD;
      splints has not been established. Moreover, it has been clearly shown that the elderly&#xD;
      patients have good functional outcomes that do not correlate with the position in which the&#xD;
      fracture heals i.e. they tolerated a large degree of fracture malunion (Arora; Egol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to show that there is no difference in the final functional&#xD;
      outcome between distal radius fractures treated non-operatively with splints and casts. The&#xD;
      secondary goals are to demonstrate: (1) splinting results in greater patient comfort and&#xD;
      acceptance; (2) there is no significant difference in final radiographic outcomes between DRF&#xD;
      treated with casts and splints; and (3) there is no difference in clinical outcome at the&#xD;
      6-month and 12-month follow-up points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is clinically important for several reasons. First, patients may be encouraged to&#xD;
      use splints instead of casts if there is no difference in functional outcome and the former&#xD;
      provide better comfort. Second, patients may not be required to present for long (&gt;6-month)&#xD;
      follow-ups if it can be shown that the clinical improvement plateaus at 6 months after&#xD;
      injury. This is consistent with our aim to improve patients' overall quality of life after&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries and forms a core component of functional ageing.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study methodology will be a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT). A non-inferiority design was selected because it is unlikely that splints are superior to casts with regards to the primary outcome - final functional outcome at 12 months. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Splinting results in Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, Hand (QuickDASH) scores that are not poorer as compared to casting</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The resultant score is reported on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents no disability and 100 represents total disability.&#xD;
Splinting in patients â‰¥60 years with distal radius fracture (DRF) results in 12-month QuickDASH scores that are significantly inferior compared to scores in patients treated in cast.&#xD;
The alternate hypothesis is that splinting results in 12-month QuickDASH scores that are not significantly inferior compared to casting in this group of patients.</description>

    <description>Patients presenting with DRF will be screened by the attending consultant. The temporary backslab will be removed, X-rays will be obtained, and the attending consultant will discuss the treatment options. Patients who are planned for non-operative treatment and meet the inclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. The purpose and details of the study will be explained and informed consent will then be taken by the research coordinator (RC). The participants will then be randomized (using a block-randomization method) to either treatment by splint or cast. A research assistant will facilitate the randomisation process so that the RC and the treating physician remain blinded to treatment allocation.</description>
