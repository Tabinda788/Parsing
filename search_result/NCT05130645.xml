  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway management is extremely important for providing safe anesthesia. Endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation, on the other hand, is the most important step in airway management, especially&#xD;
      since it requires rapid and successful execution. Inadequate airway management; is associated&#xD;
      with complications that require high-level care and cost, such as death, brain damage,&#xD;
      increased need for intensive care, prolonged recovery period, and emergency tracheostomy.&#xD;
      15-25% of anesthesia-related deaths are associated with airway management. 17% of settled&#xD;
      cases against anesthesiologists are composed of airway-related events (often difficult&#xD;
      intubation, inadequate oxygenation/ventilation, and pulmonary aspiration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important point in ensuring airway patency is preoperative evaluation. Difficulties&#xD;
      arising from anatomical features can be revealed by careful evaluation of mouth opening, the&#xD;
      structure of tongue and palate, thyromental distance (TMM), sternomental distance (SMM),&#xD;
      mobility of cervical vertebrae, jaw occlusion, and necessary precautions can be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used tests to determine the degree of difficulty of intubation are the&#xD;
      modified Mallampati test, the thyromental distance, the upper lip bite test, the inter&#xD;
      incisor space, and the sternomental distance. Recent studies are trying to confirm the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of existing tests. However, there is no test with 100%&#xD;
      specificity and sensitivity in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation.&#xD;

      In this prospective observational study, two new parameters &quot;mandibular profile angle&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;mandibular mental angle&quot; will be evaluated with the Cormack-Lehane Score during laryngoscopy&#xD;
      as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy. Modified Mallampati test, neck circumference,&#xD;
      thyromental distance, sternomental distance, and many other tests have been used for&#xD;
      predicting difficult intubation however, none of them are able to predict &quot;difficult&#xD;
      intubation&quot; exactly. &quot;mandibular profile angle&quot; and &quot;mandibular mental angle&quot; may provide new&#xD;
      horizons for predicting difficult intubation. These two measurements will be compared with&#xD;
      the Cormack-Lehane score during laryngoscopy for sensitivity, specificity, and positive or&#xD;
      negative predictive values. As well as the Cormack-Lehane Score, we will be comparing these&#xD;
      angle measurements' predictive values with the other specified predictive tests such as&#xD;
      Modified Mallampati test, neck circumference, thyromental distance, sternomental distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having received informed consent, 1000 ASA I-III patients aged between 18-80, who will be&#xD;
      operated under general anesthesia, will be included in this prospective observational study.&#xD;
      The number of patients is determined according to the numbers in previous studies, but will&#xD;
      be finalized as 90% power and 5% error as a result of the power analysis after the prior&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the anesthesia induction the Modified Mallampati test, neck circumference, thyromental&#xD;
      distance, sternomental distance will be measured as well as &quot;mandibular profile angle&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;mandibular mental angle&quot;. &quot;Mandibular profile angle&quot; is defined as; The angle between the&#xD;
      mentum of the mandibula and the lateral tips of the mandibula where the profiler ends.&#xD;
      &quot;Mandibular mental angle&quot; is defined as; the angle between the mentum of the mandibula and&#xD;
      the two ends of the mandibular arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia, the difficulty of laryngoscopy will be determined by&#xD;
      Cormack-Lehane Score by a senior anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having received the measurements, tests for sensitivity and specificity, and&#xD;
      negative/positive predictive values for difficult intubation will be processed.&#xD;
