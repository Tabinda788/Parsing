      This study will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a&#xD;
      blinded Main Treatment Period (MT) and an Open Label Period (OLE) to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of IMU-838 in adult patients with RMS. The study will consist of the&#xD;
      following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period: Approximately 28 days Main Treatment Period: Up to 72 weeks (approximately&#xD;
      15 months) Open Label Extension Period: Up to approximately 8 years&#xD;
