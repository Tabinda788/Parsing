  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IIb clinical study aims to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose&#xD;
      of recombinant protein RBD fusion dimer vaccine as a heterologous booster (to subjects who&#xD;
      have received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty) COVID-19 vaccine at least&#xD;
      182 days prior to the booster dose in this study) versus a homologous booster (subjects who&#xD;
      received the second dose of the Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine at least 182 days prior to the&#xD;
      booster dose in this study) will receive a third dose of the Comirnaty vaccine).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population includes 1075 healthy adults aged above 18 years old who have received&#xD;
      two doses of the Comirnaty vaccine, and are at least 182 days and less than 365 days after&#xD;
      their second dose will be randomly assigned to two treatment arms. In each arm, volunteers&#xD;
      will be randomized in a ratio Test vaccine:Comirnaty of 2:1. Each participant will receive&#xD;
      one booster immunisation and will be followed for 1 year to evaluate immunogenicity response&#xD;
      and assess the safety of the test vaccine in comparison to Cominarty.&#xD;
