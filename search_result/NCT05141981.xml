      Skeletal muscle is the largest body compartment in most adults with the exception of an&#xD;
      enlarged adipose tissue mass in the presence of obesity. Skeletal muscles grow in size from&#xD;
      birth onward, reaching peak mass in the third decade. Many factors determine an individual&#xD;
      adult's total body skeletal muscle mass and include their size(height),magnitude of&#xD;
      adiposity, race, genetic factors, activity, hormone levels and diet. By the fourth decade&#xD;
      populations and individuals begin to show a gradual loss in skeletal muscle mass and the rate&#xD;
      of atrophy appears to accelerate beyond the seventh decade. The senescence-related changes in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle are, in turn, associated with adverse out- comes such as pathological bone&#xD;
      fractures and even death. The term sarcopenia, from the Greek roots is widely used to&#xD;
      describe the age-associated decrease in muscle mass observed in several cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal studies. Interest in sarcopenia mainly results from its linkage with unfavorable&#xD;
      outcomes, including mobility disorders, increased risk of falling, reduced ability to&#xD;
      function in activities of daily living, loss of independence, poor quality of life, and&#xD;
      reduced life expectancy. Measuring skeletal muscle mass, composition, strength and physical&#xD;
      performance is thus a vital part of not only studying sarcopenia, but also of growing&#xD;
      importance in clinically evaluating and monitoring the greatly increasing population of&#xD;
      ageing at risk adults in most countries. Our report highlights aspects of evaluating these&#xD;
      features of skeletal muscle and expands on earlier methodological and historical reviews.&#xD;
      While the main phenotypic feature of sarcopenia is loss of lean tissue, notably skeletal&#xD;
      muscle, there is growing recognition that sarcopenia can co-exist in the presence of obesity.&#xD;
      A skeletal muscle compartment reduced in mass may thus be masked by the presence of excess&#xD;
      fat. Diagnosing sarcopenia-obesity may thus include measures beyond that of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass such as BMI and total body fat, topics that we will allude to in the review that&#xD;
      follows. Loss of skeletal muscle also plays an important role in two other conditions,&#xD;
      cachexia and frailty, creating a spectrum of phenotypes and clinical conditions that&#xD;
      encompass sarcopenia There are two main factors for Skeletal muscle evaluation, skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mass and composition, are the main determinants of global muscle metabolic function,&#xD;
      strength and physical performance. Vascular and neurological integrity are also essential&#xD;
      components that ultimately contribute to a skeletal muscle's metabolic and mechanical&#xD;
      functionality. The'quality' of a skeletal muscle is a loosely defined concept that broadly&#xD;
      includes aspects of anatomic structure, chemical composition and metabolic and mechanical&#xD;
      performance. Our review encompasses aspects of measuring skeletal muscle mass, composition&#xD;
      and function in relation to the evaluation of individuals and groups for the presence of&#xD;
      sarcopenia and related conditions. Multiple methods of measuring skeletal muscle mass are&#xD;
      available for research and clinical purposes that vary in cost, complexity and availability.&#xD;
      A high prevalence of low muscle mass in hip-fracture patients has been shown. Hip fractures&#xD;
      carry a high risk of both death and disability with a 8-36 % excess mortality within 1 year&#xD;
      and more than 50 % of the survivors not regaining their own pre-injury level of independence.&#xD;
      Sarcopenia may worsen the functional prognosis after hip fracture occurrence, but the&#xD;
      association between reduced muscle mass and functional ability remains unclear in this group&#xD;
      of older and frail persons. Conversely, muscle strength has been indicated as a strong&#xD;
      independent predictor of the functional outcome, whereas lower-limb performance is usually&#xD;
      not accessible at an early stage, because of the direct consequences of the hip fracture on&#xD;
      ambulation. There are no available studies in our locality about sarcopenia and its related&#xD;
      factors&#xD;
