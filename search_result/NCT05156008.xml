  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 2 billion peripheral vascular cannulas (PVCs) are introduced globally each year.&#xD;
      Each patient needs venous access for surgery under anesthesia. It is the most frequently&#xD;
      performed invasive procedure in medicine in the whole world. Nevertheless, investigators&#xD;
      still do not know how to fix them adequately, to work reliably for at least 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then there is a group of patients with difficult intravenous access (DIVA). These patients&#xD;
      often have to undergo repeated painful punctures through the skin when introducing PVC. Many&#xD;
      times well trained healthcare worker in the ultrasound-guided vascular access is needed to&#xD;
      introduce PVC in DIVA patients. Up to one third of adult patients are DIVA. In overweight&#xD;
      orthopedic patients, this subpopulation can reach up to 50% . Up to 64% PVC fails within 72&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that PVC introduced at the site of limb flexion (elbow, wrist),&#xD;
      repeated punctures increase the risk of thrombosis, infection and phlebitis. In expert&#xD;
      groups, ultrasonographically guided vascular access (UGVA) appears to be a significantly&#xD;
      better method, but studies on larger groups of patients are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesise that UGVA is superior in many parameters. The aim of our study is&#xD;
      to compare two types of cannula insertion methods and their benefits and risks for patients.&#xD;
      Ultrasound guided insertion and palpation guided insertion. To have evidence robust enough&#xD;
      and after statistical analysis investigators decided for sample of 500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate data after 100, 250 and 500 patients. After statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be calculate benefit/risk ratio for patients and take steps towards patient safety and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be managed according to the protocol of principles of Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      and valid regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are divided in two groups. Group A (insertion by palpation of vein): standard&#xD;
      cannula (name brand &quot;vasofix&quot; BBraun) insertion through vein palpation and insertion in block&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - prior insertion medical staff will fill in study protocol form A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (UGVA): DIVA score calculation, Ultrasound-guided (name brand &quot;deep access introcan&quot;&#xD;
      BBraun) cannula insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
      - prior insertion medical staff will fill in study protocol form B&#xD;
&#xD;
      In primary outcome investigators hypothesised that UGVA need less attempts to successful&#xD;
      cannulation in comparison with vein cannulation by palpation. Investigators also think that&#xD;
      deep vein cannula secured by UGVA will have lower failure rates by any means. In general&#xD;
      there are several benefits in UGVA. On the other hand all above is applicable only in hands&#xD;
      of well trained medical staff.&#xD;

    <description>Number of punctures through skin defines number of attempts. Every puncture of skin with cannula is considered as attempt. Number of attempts are recorded in protocol as whole number. Does not matter with technique is used.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Long peripheral venous cannulas inserted under ultrasound guidance have low failure rate for intravenous therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Inability to administer intravenous therapy through cannula from any reason is considered as failure of cannula. Failure rate is calculated from ratio of cannulas that did not fail to cannulas that failed. Is marked in results as percentage (%) as whole number and two decimals.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Time measurement starts when operator puts probe on patient and starts prescan of veins. Time measurement stops when cannula is successfully inserted confirmed by blood return after removal of internal metal piece. Is measured in minutes and seconds.</description>

    <measure>Venous access by palpation time to successful cannulation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Time measurement starts when nurse or physician starts to assess veins. Tourniquet application, disinfection of skin, palpation and cannulation are considered as process of cannulation. Time measurement stops when cannula is successfully inserted confirmed by blood return after removal of internal metal piece. Is measured in minutes and seconds.</description>

    <measure>Ultrasound guided venous access allows insertion of cannulas suitable for blood drawing</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>During UGVA measurement of vein diameter measurement is mandatory. If diameter of vein in millimeters is equal to higher to Fr of catheter/cannula it should allow to draw blood without need for repeated vein punctures for blood sampling. Cannula G22 need 2,7mm vein diameter, Cannula G20 need 3,3mm vein diameter. Cannula G18 need 3,9mm vein diameter. In protocol there is mark on every day that cannula allows blood drawing. Is marked as yes-no immediately after insertion, and than every day until removal of cannula.</description>

    <description>Every need of blood draw is marked in protocol, time spend to draw blood is marked in protocol. Measured in minutes and seconds. There are to scenarios. Blood draw through cannula: Measurement starts the moment nurse applies flush of saline, after that nurse will draw blood according to protocol, time measurement stops when saline flush is administered after successful blood draw. If not successful then measurement continues through blood draw by venipuncture.&#xD;
Scenario two: blood draw through venipuncture: time measurement starts when nurse starts to assess veins for venipuncture. Time measurement stops after successful blood draw and after venipuncture site covering with tampon and tape.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm will have peripheral venous cannula inserted under realtime ultrasound guidance. Out of plane technique (in plane technique if too deep when tip of the needle is on vessel wall) used by experienced physicians in UGVA. Out of plane technique strictly used in step by step manner. That means moving probe with the tip of the needle to always locate its exact position, all the way into the vein. All performed insertions are carried out by skilled operators in UGVA with out of plane technique. Just before surgery in block room.</description>
