  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to verify the efficacy of the Family Connections intervention for&#xD;
      relatives of people diagnosed with suicidal behavior disorder in a randomized control trial&#xD;
      with a Spanish participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family members of people who have attempted suicide feel guilty, afraid, hopeless, depression&#xD;
      and anxiety. The needs of family members of people with suicide attempts are not adequately&#xD;
      addressed in the current treatments for people with suicide attempts. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      necessary to help the relatives of people with suicidal behaviors to reduce the discomfort&#xD;
      and burden they experience by giving them information and skills to improve their&#xD;
      relationship with patients. Family Connections (FC) is a program that has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing burden, depression, and anxiety, and in increasing dominance and&#xD;
      validating behaviors in relatives of people with borderline personality disorder. However,&#xD;
      there are no Randomized Control Trials that demonstrate the efficacy of FC program in&#xD;
      patients with suicide attempts. In a previous study, FC was adapted in an open trial with&#xD;
      relatives of people who had attempted suicide. The results of this pilot study suggest that&#xD;
      the FC program tailored to relatives of patients with suicide attempts may be effective in&#xD;
      improving well-being and reducing the burden of illness in relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team adapted FC for relatives of people diagnosed with suicidal behavior&#xD;
      disorder (SBD) for delivery in the Spanish population. The FC-SCD program contains 12&#xD;
      two-hour sessions held once a week. The first aim is to verify the efficacy of the FC&#xD;
      intervention for relatives of people diagnosed with SBD in a randomized control trial with a&#xD;
      Spanish sample of participants from mental health services. The second objective is to&#xD;
      analyze the feasibility and acceptance of FC-SBD in relatives. The third aim is to analyze&#xD;
      whether the changes produced in the psychological variables in the relatives after the&#xD;
      intervention are related to changes in the psychological variables of the patients. This&#xD;
      paper presents the study protocol. The study design consists of a two-arm randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, there will be two conditions: Family Connections (FC-SBD) or Treatment as&#xD;
      usual optimized (TAU-O). Participants will be relatives of patients who meet DSM-5 criteria&#xD;
      for SBD. The caregivers' primary outcome measures will be the BAS. Secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      DASS-21, FES, DERS, QoL. The patient's primary outcome measures will be the INQ, PHQ-9,&#xD;
      OASIS, VIRS, LUMP. Participants will be assessed at pretreatment, post-treatment, and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. The intention-to-treat principle will be used when analyzing data, using&#xD;
      mixed-effects models with full information and maximum likelihood estimation.&#xD;
