  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-arm, individual participant randomised controlled, assessor-blinded trial in 7 MND care&#xD;
      centres across Australia will be undertaken.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a treatment that uses positive pressure delivered via a&#xD;
      face mask or mouthpiece to assist a person to breathe. It can be used as a long-term&#xD;
      treatment for people whose breathing is failing - usually due to chronic conditions that&#xD;
      produce weakness of the respiratory muscles such as motor neurone disease / amyotrophic&#xD;
      lateral sclerosis [MND/ALS]chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Most people with MND/ALS&#xD;
      use NIV at night initially. Even though NIV may improve survival and function, many are&#xD;
      unable to use it for more than 4 hours per day (which is considered a threshold amount of use&#xD;
      in order to gain a benefit) and many others are unable to tolerate it at all. Our team has&#xD;
      recently provided evidence that specific and individualised titration of NIV leads to better&#xD;
      outcomes in people with MND. This previous trial determined that the use of a sleep study&#xD;
      (also called 'polysomnography') can improve the way people are initially set up with NIV.&#xD;
      This study will replicate and extend the single site study in a large, multi-centre&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) across multiple sites This multi-centre RCT will also&#xD;
      include a 12-month follow-up period to evaluate longer-term outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>This trial of PSG-assisted commencement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in motor neurone disease (MND) follows the methodology of our previous single-site study (Hannan et al 2019 ERJ), with the addition of an open label cohort that extends until (the earlier of) 12 months or death.&#xD;
After empirical NIV set-up and an acclimatisation period (3 weeks), participants will undergo single night in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). The PSG will be performed and supervised by a sleep scientist. In the intervention group, the &quot;intervention&quot; PSG results will be used to adjust/titrate NIV settings to optimize ventilation and improve synchrony between the patient and the NIV device. Participants will be asked to continue to use NIV as prescribed for the subsequent 7 week intervention period.</description>

    <description>The participants allocated to the control group will also be asked to attend a single night in-laboratory PSG. The NIV settings will not be adjusted throughout the PSG (&quot;sham&quot; PSG). Participants in the control group will retain their original settings after the sham PSG, and will be asked to continue to use NIV in this manner for the subsequent 7 week intervention period.</description>
