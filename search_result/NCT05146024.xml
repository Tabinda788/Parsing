  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Responsible beverage service (RBS) training for alcohol servers is a promising intervention&#xD;
      for reducing driving while intoxicated (DWI) by alcohol. Training, certification, and&#xD;
      in-service contact improves professionalism and effectiveness of prevention interventions&#xD;
      delivered by community members such as alcohol servers. This SBIR Fast-track project will&#xD;
      develop and test an in-service professional development component to the WayToServe® online&#xD;
      RBS training to improve the effectiveness of RBS training in order to make further gains in&#xD;
      reducing problem alcohol behavior in communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the interventions targeting driving while intoxicated (DWI) by alcohol, Responsible&#xD;
      Beverage Service (RBS) training of alcohol servers has shown promise. RBS training is&#xD;
      currently required or incentivized by 36 U.S. states and California will require it starting&#xD;
      in 2022. Our team has shown that an online RBS training, named WayToServe®, was effective in&#xD;
      two randomized trials. These results filled a gap in the literature on RBS training that is&#xD;
      limited by the lack of randomized trials, poor measurement of training implementation, and&#xD;
      almost exclusive focus on live training when online training predominates. The goal of this&#xD;
      SBIR Fast-track research is to develop and test an in-service professional development&#xD;
      component for alcohol servers trained by WayToServe to improve its effectiveness. It is&#xD;
      intended to motivate servers to implement the RBS skills in the face of common barriers,&#xD;
      provide support for RBS actions from a &quot;community&quot; of alcohol servers, and prevent natural&#xD;
      degradation of skills over time. Rationale for this product is provided by past research&#xD;
      showing that training, certification, and in-service contact improves professionalism and&#xD;
      efficacy of community prevention interventions. Scientific premise is provided by the&#xD;
      positive results of our trials on the WayToServe® training. The in-service component will be&#xD;
      delivered through the WayToServe Facebook page that currently is &quot;followed&quot; by over 20,000&#xD;
      alcohol servers trained by WayToServe. The specific aims of Phase I are to: 1) develop&#xD;
      content of in-service professional development on RBS skills with a) premises owners/&#xD;
      managers interviews and b) alcohol servers in New Mexico and Washington State trained by the&#xD;
      WayToServe online RBS training through focus group discussions; 2) produce a prototype&#xD;
      WayToServe Plus in-service professional development component in flowcharts and an initial&#xD;
      library of Facebook posts, including text, graphics, and interactive elements and evaluate it&#xD;
      for acceptability, usability, and engagement in focus groups and field pilot trial with&#xD;
      alcohol servers in New Mexico and Washington State trained by the WayToServe online RBS&#xD;
      training, and 3) determine feasibility of WayToServe Plus in-service professional development&#xD;
      component and develop evaluation plans for Phase II research. Milestones will be an&#xD;
      EAB-approved Phase I research plans and development of the content outline and WayToServe&#xD;
      Plus prototype, evaluation of WayToServe Plus prototype, and feasibility assessment of the&#xD;
      WayToServe Plus in-service professional development component. Phase II specific aims will&#xD;
      achieve the milestones of full production of WayToServe Plus and a randomized trial testing&#xD;
      its effectiveness by: 4) producing the full WayToServe Plus in-service professional&#xD;
      development component and 5) conducting a randomized trial with 160 alcohol premises in New&#xD;
      Mexico and Washington State evaluating effectiveness of WayToServe Plus on refusal of sales&#xD;
      to PiP (primary outcome). The SBIR research is innovative as WayToServe Plus will be the&#xD;
      first continuous in-service professional development for RBS and will increase the WayToServe&#xD;
      training's effectiveness and commercial advantage with alcohol servers and corporate clients.&#xD;
