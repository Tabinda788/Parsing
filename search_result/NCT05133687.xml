      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caudal block is one of the most used regional blocks in pediatrics because it is safe and&#xD;
      provides efficient and adequate perioperative analgesia for most of the infra-umbilical and&#xD;
      lower limb procedures.[1,2] It has been proposed that the cardiovascular effects of neuraxial&#xD;
      blocks are less marked in children than in adults because of lower systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance (SVR) in pediatric population.[3] There is a wide range of doses used in caudal&#xD;
      block depending on the desired dermatomal level which can range from 0.5ml/kg up to&#xD;
      1.25ml/kg. [1] However, studies assessing effects and safety of different volumes of caudal&#xD;
      blocks on different hemodynamic variables are scarce and show conflicting results due to&#xD;
      small sample sizes, absence of control groups, retrospective nature, different additives and&#xD;
      different methods for measuring the hemodynamics.[4-8] Electrical Cardiometry (EC) estimates&#xD;
      cardiac parameters by measuring changes in thoracic electrical bioimpedance during the&#xD;
      cardiac cycle using skin electrodes. It has emerged as a new noninvasive tool for assessment&#xD;
      of cardiac output with a good accuracy in adult and pediatric anesthesia.[9] The current&#xD;
      study is designed to estimate the effects of different volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% caudal&#xD;
      block on different hemodynamic parameters assessed by electrical cardiometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that different volumes of plain bupivacaine 0.25% caudal block could have&#xD;
      direct effects on different hemodynamic parameters in pediatrics undergoing lower abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a double blinded randomized controlled trial that will be conducted at Abu Al&#xD;
      Reesh Children's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University after approval of research&#xD;
      and ethics committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be recruited into the trial during pre-operative assessment. Recruited children&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio; (Group 0.8-G) to receive&#xD;
      general anesthesia and caudal block with 0.8 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.25% and (Group 1.2-G) to&#xD;
      receive general anesthesia and caudal block with 1.2 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.25% and (Group G)&#xD;
      to receive general anesthesia with local infiltration of the wound or transversus abdominis&#xD;
      plan block (TAPB) at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be achieved using a computer-generated sequence. Concealment will be&#xD;
      achieved using opaque envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will be anesthetized in accordance with the local policy of pediatric anesthesia&#xD;
      unit in Abu El-Reesh pediatric hospital-Cairo university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoperative examination and upon arrival to the operating room heart rate HR,&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure NBP and oxygen saturation SPO2 will be monitored using standard&#xD;
      monitor (drȁger infinity vista XL) before inhalational induction of anesthesia using&#xD;
      titration of sevoflurane in oxygen air mixture 60% (starting from 3% up to 8%) until the&#xD;
      child is put to sleep. Electrical cardiometry device (ICON; Cardiotonic, Osypka; Berlin,&#xD;
      Germany) will be applied to the patient through 4 ECG electrodes at the following sites:&#xD;
      (forehead, left side of the neck, left mid-axillary line at the level of xiphoid process and&#xD;
      left thigh). Patient's sex, height, and weight will be entered into the device, which is set&#xD;
      to estimate cardiovascular parameters at a 20-beat moving average recorded every10 seconds.&#xD;
      The ECG electrodes will be placed before induction for cooperative children. Baseline&#xD;
      electrical cardiometry (ICON) data (Cardiac output, Cardiac index, Stroke volume, Stroke&#xD;
      volume variation, Stroke index, Systemic vascular resistance, Systemic vascular resistance&#xD;
      index, ICON, VIC, Thoracic fluid index, Left cardiac work, Systolic time ratio, Pre ejection&#xD;
      period, Left ventricular ejection time) will be recorded by averaging 3 sets of data over 30&#xD;
      seconds by an anesthesia resident who is blinded to the children groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After securing an intravenous line anesthesia will be completed with 1-2µg/kg of fentanyl and&#xD;
      atracurium 0.5 mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained by&#xD;
      using 1-1.5% isoflurane in a mixture of oxygen and air (50/50) and atracurium top ups at a&#xD;
      dose of 0.1mg/kg every 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concealed envelopes will then be opened by a second anesthesia resident (who will not be&#xD;
      involved in patient management) and he will be responsible for preparing and giving the&#xD;
      caudal block for the caudal groups as instructed in the envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in groups (0.8-G) and (1.2-G) will then be positioned on their right side, and a&#xD;
      22-gauge needle will be aseptically inserted into the caudal epidural space. Bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.25% at a dose of 0.8 ml/kg and 1.2 ml/kg making sure not to exceed a maximum of 2.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      will be slowly injected. After repositioning the children on their backs, a 10-min&#xD;
      steady-state period without surgical stimulation will be permitted during which a multiple&#xD;
      set of measurements will be obtained every 2 minutes (a single set of measurements will be&#xD;
      recorded by averaging 3 sets of data over 30 seconds), and surgery will be started after this&#xD;
      period. Caudal success will be defined as change of hemodynamics (heart rate and or blood&#xD;
      pressure) &lt; 20% of base line parameters to surgical incision without need for additional&#xD;
      analgesics or increase of inhalational anesthetics. Patients with caudal failure will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group G the surgery will be started after 10 minutes from the induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      where a multiple sets of ICON measurements will be obtained every 2 minutes (a single set of&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded by averaging 3 sets of data over 30 seconds), from the previous&#xD;
      baseline measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups ICON measurements will be obtained every 10 minutes after start of surgery till&#xD;
      the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups HR, NBP, SPO2 and end tidal CO2 will be measured every 2 minutes for 10 minutes&#xD;
      after induction of anesthesia then every 10 minutes till the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will receive a loading dose of 10 ml/kg of lactated ringer solution over 10&#xD;
      minutes after induction of anesthesia and will be maintained on 3 ml/kg/h lactated ringer&#xD;
      solution.&#xD;
