  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label, phase III, multi-centre, randomised trial with a non-inferiority objective&#xD;
      will evaluate the additive diagnostic value of PSMA PET for men with negative/equivocal MRI&#xD;
      in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer. Patients with a clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      prostate cancer with PI-RADS 2 or 3 on MRI, meeting all the inclusion and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be randomised into experimental and control arms. Patients in the&#xD;
      experimental arm would be subjected to Pelvic PSMA PET/CT, wherein the PSMA negative patients&#xD;
      would not undergo biopsy as opposed to PSMA positive patients who will be subjected to&#xD;
      Transperineal targeted prostate biopsy. Whereas patients in the control arm will only receive&#xD;
      Standard of Care (SOC) with no additional imaging (PSMA PET) and will undergo Transperineal&#xD;
      template prostate biopsy. The co-primary objectives are to assess (1) the percentage of men&#xD;
      with sPCa in the experimental arm (transperineal targeted biopsy) compared to the control arm&#xD;
      (transperineal template biopsy) defined as the presence of a single biopsy core indicating&#xD;
      disease Gleason score (GS) 3+4(&gt;10%)=7, grade group (GG) 2, and (2) the percentage of men who&#xD;
      avoid transperineal prostate biopsy between both arms. The secondary objectives include&#xD;
      determining the percentage of clinically insignificant PCa on targeted biopsy (experimental&#xD;
      arm) versus transperineal template biopsy (control arm); estimating the difference in&#xD;
      complications from transperineal prostate biopsy between both arms; the health economics&#xD;
      impact between the experimental and control arms; estimating the mean difference between both&#xD;
      arms in change from baseline in health-related quality of life (QoL); estimating the mean&#xD;
      difference between both arms at each time point in generalised anxiety and cancer worry.&#xD;

    <description>cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained associated with the use of PSMA PET in addition to MRI compared with MRI alone for the diagnosis of sPCa.

    <description>Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed using QLQ-C30, which contains 30 items across five functional scales, three symptom scales, global health status, and six single items. Participant responses are collected using a four-point response scale ranging from 'Not at all' to &quot;Very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate better QoL and function, while high scores for the symptom scale represent a high level of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The generalized anxiety disorder Scale (GAD-7)14 is a 7-item, patient-rated questionnaire for screening and severity measuring of generalised anxiety disorder. The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and 'nearly every day', respectively, and adding together the scores for the seven questions. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>

    <description>The modified Cancer Worry Scale adaptation of Cancer Worry Scale is a 3-item questionnaire used in context of cancer worry in abnormal PSA levels in men participating in community screening program. The score is calculated by assigning scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4, to the categories 'not at all or rarely', 'sometimes', 'often', and 'a lot', respectively, and adding together the scores for the 3 questions. A final question asks about feelings of distress related to cancer risk.</description>
