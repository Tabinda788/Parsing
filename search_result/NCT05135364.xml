  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of HAIC combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitor and immunotherapy&#xD;
      have been proved by the clinical research. In this single-arm, open-label, prospective study,&#xD;
      for those patients with unresectable primary HCC, in the case of failure of TACE treatment,&#xD;
      the combination of HAIC, TKI and immunotherapy is expected to bring new breakthroughs.&#xD;
