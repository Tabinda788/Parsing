      Material &amp; Methods: This Randomized Control Trial was conducted in Bahria University College&#xD;
      of Physical Therapy, Karachi. Ethical approval was prior taken from Institute Review Board.&#xD;
      there were 32 participants selected randomly equally in experimental and control group. Both&#xD;
      male and female were included with age of 25 to 55 years currently employees of Bahria&#xD;
      University (BUMDC) having forward head posture or complaining neck pain were included.&#xD;
      Exclusion was age less than 25 years, history of cervical trauma or surgery, any neurological&#xD;
      conditions or cervical pathology. Experimental Group was given DCF exercises with Pressure&#xD;
      Biofeedback Unit (PBU) and Control Group was given Conventional DCF Exercises. SPSS version&#xD;
      23.0 was used for analysis.&#xD;

    <description>The pressure biofeedback unit was placed between the plinth and the posterior aspect of the neck just below the occiput and inflated to a baseline of 20 mmHg. A trained physiotherapist was observing and correcting any substitution movements to ensure that all subjects could perform the exercises correctly. All exercise protocols and programs were taken from previously published studies8-10. A conventional DCF exercise protocol was performed three times a week for four weeks in both groups. The duration of the conventional DCF exercise protocol was 20-30 minutes, once a day in the control group, and 15-20 minutes, once a day in the experimental group</description>
