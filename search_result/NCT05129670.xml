      This investigation is designed to evaluate the acid neutralisation action of a new test&#xD;
      product versus unmatched placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this confirmatory clinical investigation is to evaluate the acid&#xD;
      neutralisation action of a calcite chewing gum, by comparing the antacid action with an&#xD;
      unmatched placebo chewing gum. The clinical investigation will also assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the calcite chewing gum.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This clinical investigation is being conducted to characterise the acid neutralisation activity of the test product, a calcite chewing gum, by comparing the antacid action with an unmatched placebo chewing gum. In this clinical investigation, the test product's ability to increase the pH within the oesophagus will be evaluated against an unmatched placebo.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient with a primary diagnosis of symptomatic GORD in accordance with the Montreal&#xD;
             definition. Patients must have experienced frequent troublesome heartburn and / or&#xD;
             regurgitation (with or without dyspepsia symptoms) of mild/moderate intensity. If the&#xD;
             patient also has other symptoms, the heartburn, regurgitation or dyspepsia should be&#xD;
             the predominant symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient that are healthy (with the exception of a diagnosis of GORD) as determined by&#xD;
             past medical history and vital signs at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a history or active gastrointestinal disease (gastroduodenal ulcer,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal haemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation) or hiatus hernia&#xD;
             which is greater than 3 cm or a history of conditions that can lead to abnormal&#xD;
             oesophageal pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients experiencing frequent troublesome heartburn and / or regurgitation (with or&#xD;
             without dyspepsia symptoms) of severe intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are unwilling to refrain from using antacids or alginates 24 hours prior&#xD;
             to the start of the treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are unwilling to refrain from using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2&#xD;
             antagonists, motility stimulants or other medicines for relief of symptoms of acid&#xD;
             reflux disease 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment period.&#xD;
