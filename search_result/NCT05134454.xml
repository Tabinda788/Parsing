  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes behind death and permanent disability in adults. Atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia and its prevalence is steeply&#xD;
      increasing with age. Atrial fibrillation is associated with a manifold increase in the risk&#xD;
      for stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is considered important to investigate the heart rhythm in stroke survivors without&#xD;
      previously known AF, because detection of AF will prompt a change in antithrombotic treatment&#xD;
      with subsequent lowering of the risk of recurrent stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are so far very few studies on the prognostic impact of ECG investigations post stroke.&#xD;
      Despite this knowledge gap, ECG investigation post stroke is given high priority in national&#xD;
      and international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerable clinical resources are currently invested in these ECG investigations without&#xD;
      knowledge of its utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan a nationwide, randomised, register-based study (RRCT) including&#xD;
      patients aged at least 70 years receiving in-hospital care for stroke or TIA (Transient&#xD;
      Ischemic Attack). Included patients will be randomised to standard investigation (1-2 days of&#xD;
      ECG ) or extended ECG investigation (14 days of ECG performed at least twice). Patients&#xD;
      diagnosed AF will be offered anticoagulation treatment. Long-term follow-up will be performed&#xD;
      via swedish health care registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of this trial will have major impact on the ECG screening recommendations for&#xD;
      patients who have had stroke, a large group of patients with dismal prognosis.&#xD;

      Purpose and aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the trial is to study the prognostic impact of ECG investigation after stroke&#xD;
      or TIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate if extended ECG screening after stroke as compared to standard ECG&#xD;
      screening reduces the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of stroke, death and&#xD;
      intracranial bleeding in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Secondary&#xD;
      aims include effects on major bleeding, myocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation prevalence, oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey of the field Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and&#xD;
      a major cause behind permanent disability in adults. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most&#xD;
      prevalent permanent clinically relevant arrhythmia with a steeply increasing incidence with&#xD;
      advancing age. Atrial fibrillation is also one of the strongest risk factors for stroke. The&#xD;
      increased stroke risk associated with AF can be markedly reduced by OAC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, AF is paroxysmal and asymptomatic in a significant proportion of patients,&#xD;
      leading to lower detection rates and a similar proportion of stroke survivors with an&#xD;
      untreated risk factor and higher risk of stroke recurrence. For this reason, it is widely&#xD;
      recommended to make ECG recordings in patients suffering from stroke and TIA in order to&#xD;
      detect previously undiagnosed AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, no study so far has been reported to bring evidence on the benefit of ECG AF&#xD;
      screening in terms of reduced stroke recurrence and mortality after a stroke event. However,&#xD;
      several studies have reported the yield of new AF diagnosis in stroke/TIA patients using&#xD;
      different ECG recording strategies in different populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge gap on the possible benefits and cost effectiveness of ECG investigation after&#xD;
      stroke/TIA has led to a large variation in international recommendations, a situation&#xD;
      bringing uncertainty among policy makers, the profession and patients. The variation in&#xD;
      recommendations from different societies have unusual proportions. There is also a large&#xD;
      variation in clinical practice between different stroke units in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, since the magnitude of the net benefit (or net harm) of the ECG investigation is&#xD;
      not yet known, extensive clinical resources as well as patient effort are today put into&#xD;
      these ECG investigations without knowing about the benefit for the patient or cost&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Idea&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare current standard ECG investigation after stroke/TIA with an extended&#xD;
      ECG investigation strategy and compare long-term prognosis in terms of hard clinical&#xD;
      endpoints among participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P: Patients aged at least 70 years treated in Swedish stroke units for ischemic stroke/TIA&#xD;
      who after 24-48 hours of standard ECG investigation have shown no signs of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
      I: Extended ECG ambulatory recording, at least 2 separate recordings of 14 days each 2-4&#xD;
      months apart&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: standard Swedish ECG investigation, continuous ECG for 24-48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      O: Composite endpoint of recurrent stroke, all-cause mortality and intracerebral bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the year 2020, the mean age of Swedish stroke patients was 75 years, with a higher mean&#xD;
      age among women. Incidence of AF is strongly related to age as confirmed in epidemiological&#xD;
      studies and in screening studies. The selected cut-off age of 70 years for this study will&#xD;
      include three fourths of stroke patients targeting those at highest risk for AF. However,&#xD;
      higher age implies a risk for lower compliance to ECG recordings. This has been taken into&#xD;
      account when choosing ECG device. Hence, the chosen cut-off age for inclusion is deemed to&#xD;
      balance the yield of the ECG investigation, the benefit from OAC treatment and stroke risk if&#xD;
      AF is detected and the expected level of compliance to procedures and treatment related to&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECG investigation in the control arm is based on the minimum recommendations for stroke&#xD;
      care issued by the Swedish board of health and welfare. There are however several guidelines&#xD;
      from international societies recommending higher ambitions for this investigation, i.e longer&#xD;
      ECG recordings. Several Swedish stroke units are implementing ECG investigations after&#xD;
      stroke/TIA with ambitions higher than those stated by national minimum recommendations,&#xD;
      assuming that these investigations will give more benefit to the patient. The study design is&#xD;
      calculated to give a marked difference between the control and intervention groups to&#xD;
      overcome the possible problem with an underpowered result reported from a previous study in&#xD;
      the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans and methods for pilot study The pilot study will engage five to six patient-including&#xD;
      stroke units which are already recruited. The pilot study is planned to include 200-300&#xD;
      patients with the aim to evaluate feasibility of study management, patient inclusion,&#xD;
      inclusion rate, ECG recordings, flow of ECG data and short-term follow-up of positive ECG&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel to the pilot study, a comprehensive, digital survey on ECG investigation practice&#xD;
      covering all Swedish stroke units will be undertaken. This survey will be sent to the stroke&#xD;
      units commencing in september 2021. The outcome of the survey will give a complete and&#xD;
      up-to-date view of clinical practice and a possibility to identify suitable sites for the&#xD;
      main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 2020, there were 28 000 patients included in national stroke register for stroke or&#xD;
      TIA and three fourths of these patients were aged 70 years or older. The pilot and main study&#xD;
      are planned to include 3300 patients during 2021-2024.&#xD;
