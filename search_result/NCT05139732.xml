  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In functional neurological disorder (FND), neurological symptoms are present, such as&#xD;
      paralysis, weakness and disturbed sensation of limbs, although clinically no abnormalities&#xD;
      can be found. It is a poorly understood disorder with uncertain diagnosis, treatment and&#xD;
      prognosis. In our study, we investigate the subtype functional paralysis with advanced&#xD;
      neuroimaging techniques that go beyond standard clinical examinations. In previous research&#xD;
      on FND, healthy volunteers have generally been used as a control group. However, since people&#xD;
      with functional paralysis have similar symptoms to people with spinal cord injuries (SCI), we&#xD;
      intend to compare the three groups to find similarities and differences between the three&#xD;
      groups. With the proposed methods, we intend to gain a detailed understanding of FND&#xD;
      regarding nerve cell metabolism, diffusion pathways and neuronal networks involved in&#xD;
      cognitive processes such as motor inhibition (reaction or no reaction depending on&#xD;
      situation). Neurophysiological data, clinical assessments and questionnaires are carried out&#xD;
      in addition to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to enrol 75 participants in this study, i.e. 25 people with FND, 25 people with SCI&#xD;
      and 25 healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the study is to find markers for FND for use in future studies to improve&#xD;
      diagnosis and individualise therapy recommendation for both people with SCI and people with&#xD;
      FND. Therefore, this study is a relevant step to understand FND and to diagnose this specific&#xD;
      disease using objective MRI based diagnostic tools.&#xD;

    <description>DWI provides quantitative evaluations by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA), which are scalars of isotropic and anisotropic diffusion. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses the three-dimensional shape of the diffusion, also known as diffusion tensor. So, it is used to characterize the magnitude, the degree of anisotropy, and the orientation of directional diffusion of white matter.</description>

    <description>In order to investigate the metabolic profile, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will be applied. Functional MRI (fMRI) allows to indirectly track cell activation measuring the blood-level dependent signal changes followed spontaneously (in resting state) or evoked by a task. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is based on the differences in motion of the water molecules given by the underlying microarchitecture of the nervous tissue. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows visualisation of the nerve bundles and alterations thereof. Thus, microstructural alterations can be measured.</description>
