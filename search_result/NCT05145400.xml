  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is investigating the safety and effectiveness of using combination of&#xD;
      isatuximab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (MM). The study team will use lower doses than is currently standard for these drugs.&#xD;
      Lower doses will be used to avoid or possibly reduce any unwanted side effects commonly&#xD;
      associated with these drugs. Using lower doses of the combination isatuximab, lenalidomide&#xD;
      and dexamethasone, has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of newly diagnosed MM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the optimal treatment regimen for older and/or otherwise&#xD;
      toxicity-vulnerable patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who cannot receive&#xD;
      approved standard therapy. As a result, this Phase II trial of isatuximab, lenalidomide, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (Isa-Rd) selectively enroll much older and/or otherwise highly&#xD;
      toxicity-vulnerable participants. Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of isatuximab&#xD;
      when used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at lower doses will be&#xD;
      evaluated. It is expected that using this combination at lower doses, may help patients&#xD;
      achieve a better response while causing fewer or less severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants on the trial will also be evaluated by Cancer and Aging Research Group&#xD;
      Geriatric Assessments (CARG-GA) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL). &quot;Geriatric assessment&quot; will be referred to as &quot;global assessment&quot; for study&#xD;
      purposes, to reflect the fact that younger participants will likely participate in the study.&#xD;
      Optional correlative blood samples will be collected to study biomarkers of aging and frailty&#xD;
      with a focus on both the relation to isatuximab specifically, as well as treatment response&#xD;
      and risk for intolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of study participation will depend on the response to the treatment, and it may&#xD;
      last approximately 2 years. Participants will receive isatuximab for two years, and then&#xD;
      isatuximab will be discontinued. Dexamethasone administration will occur weekly for the first&#xD;
      eight cycles. Lenalidomide will be continued as maintenance until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment should continue until:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment delay of more than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is lost to follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (including those withdrawn for AE (Adverse Event) will be followed after&#xD;
      removal from study treatment until death or full subject withdrawal from the study for other&#xD;
      reasons. Participants removed from study treatment for unacceptable AEs will be followed for&#xD;
      resolution or stabilization of the adverse event(s).&#xD;

             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization for release of personal&#xD;
             health information (PHI). Consent must be obtained before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that&#xD;
             consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future&#xD;
             medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements&#xD;
             based on the judgement of the investigator or protocol designee.&#xD;

          3. Predicted high risk for severe toxicity from intensive induction regimens, such as&#xD;
             standard (full-dose) Bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone (VCD), lenalidomide,&#xD;
             bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD), or lenalidomide and weekly dexamethasone (Rd) as&#xD;
             each regimen was published. (Such regimens often use, for example, twice-weekly&#xD;
             bortezomib or lenalidomide at 25 mg.) High-risk is defined as one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Score ≥ 2 (indicating &quot;frail&quot;) on the International Myeloma Working Group&#xD;

               3. Felt not to be candidate for full-intensity induction by treating clinician due&#xD;
                  to comorbidities, performance status, or other factors not otherwise captured by&#xD;
                  the Palumbo system or performance status. The reason for the subject's&#xD;
                  non-candidacy for full-intensity therapy should be described in the clinical&#xD;
                  documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects qualifying for enrollment by criterion C should be discussed with the Medical&#xD;

                  treating clinician. If low ANC is felt to be due to non-MM causes, such as&#xD;
                  myelodysplasia or other bone marrow disorders unrelated to MM, then subject&#xD;
                  should not be enrolled on the study.&#xD;

             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to&#xD;
             and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to continued&#xD;
             abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin two acceptable methods of birth&#xD;
             control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method at the same&#xD;
             time, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide through 30 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of lenalidomide and 5 months after the last dose of isatuximab. FCBP must&#xD;
             also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the entire duration of treatment and&#xD;
             monthly for 5 months after the last dose of isatuximab. Men must agree to use a latex&#xD;
             or synthetic condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a&#xD;
             vasectomy from the time of signing the informed consent form through 30 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of lenalidomide and 5 months after the last dose of isatuximab. These same&#xD;
             subjects must not donate sperm. All subjects must be counseled at a minimum of every&#xD;
             28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure. All subjects enrolled&#xD;
             into this trial, must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the&#xD;
             REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a sexually mature female who: 1) has&#xD;
                  not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been&#xD;
                  naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses&#xD;
                  at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active infection requiring systemic antibiotics or other serious infection within 14&#xD;
             days prior to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects felt to not be candidates by treating physician for any systemic therapy due&#xD;
             to excessive comorbidities, frailty, impaired performance status, or other severe&#xD;
             limitations. Such limitations can be conceptualized generally as making subjects&#xD;
             exceedingly high-risk for any systemic treatment for their MM. These limitations often&#xD;
             stem from medical comorbidities unrelated to MM and they are hence unlikely to improve&#xD;
             with MM therapy. The reasons for exclusion will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical conditions that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would expose excessive risk to the subject or may interfere&#xD;
             with compliance or interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. Subjects with secondary amyloidosis due to MM are&#xD;
             eligible, if the amyloidosis is not felt to be a clinically significant issue (e.g.,&#xD;
             amyloid found incidentally on bone marrow core biopsy without evidence of&#xD;
             amyloid-mediated organ compromise).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to study treatment or has New York Heart&#xD;
             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe&#xD;
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute&#xD;
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the&#xD;
             various formulations of any agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hypersensitivity or history of intolerance to steroids, mannitol, pregelatinized&#xD;
             starch, sodium stearyl fumarate, histidine (as base and hydrochloride salt), arginine&#xD;
             hydrochloride, poloxamer 188, sucrose or any of the other components of study therapy&#xD;
             that are not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers or would prohibit&#xD;
             further treatment with these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease that could interfere with the oral absorption or&#xD;
             tolerance of dexamethasone or lenalidomide including difficulty swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a history of prior or concurrent second primary malignancy whose natural&#xD;
             history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or&#xD;
             efficacy assessment of the investigational treatment should generally be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Receiving other investigational agents less than 14 days or 5 half-lives of first dose&#xD;
             of therapy on this protocol, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments with possible exception of&#xD;
             agents with low likelihood of affecting outcome of this study, such as adjuvant&#xD;
             hormonal therapy for remote history of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Known to be HIV+ or have active infection with hepatitis A, B, or C; or tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Chronic daily corticosteroids for other, non-MM-related medical conditions exceeding&#xD;
             low-dose (e.g., prednisone ≥ 10 mg daily or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject is receiving prohibited medications or treatments as listed in the protocol&#xD;
             that cannot be discontinued/replaced by an alternative therapy.&#xD;
