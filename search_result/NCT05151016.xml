  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design was a prospective, randomized, positive-control, parallel-group, multicenter&#xD;
      clinical trial. The study included a randomized, parallel-group treatment for 24 weeks in 140&#xD;
      subjects from eight hospitals in seven cities across the country who were diagnosed with&#xD;
      Adenomyosis and associated symptoms (dysmenorrhea, with or without heavy menstrual flow) ,&#xD;
      the subjects were randomly assigned to the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Group: mifepristone tablets, 10 mg, 1 tablet daily, taken orally (beginning on the&#xD;
           third day of Menstruation) for 24 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control Group: dafinil (Triptorelin Acetate) , 3.75 mg, first injection on the third day&#xD;
           of menstruation, followed by intramuscular injection every 28 days for 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pain on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is the most commonly used instrument assessing pain in clinical practice. It reflects the patient's subjective perception of pain. Possible scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The last observation carry forward was used for missing data.&#xD;

    <measure>Pictorial blood loss assessment chart（PBAC）</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Recording the use of tampons and sanitary towels by placing a tally mark under the day next to the box. Record clots by indicating whether they are the size of a 1p or 50pcoin in the clots/ flooding row under the relevant day. E.g. under day1 you may say 50p*1 and 1p*3. Record any incidences of flooding by placing a tally mark in the clots/ flooding row under the relevant day. A lightly stained towel (pic 1) will score 1 point, a moderately stained towel (pic 2) 5 points, a towel which is saturated with blood(pic 3) will score 20 points. A lightly stained tampon (pic 4) will score 1 point, a moderately stained tampon (pic 5) 5 points and a tampon that is fully saturated will score 10 points. A clot the size of 1p scores 1 point, a 50p sized clot scores 5 pointsand flooding also scores 5 points. Finally, total up the scores. A score of100 or greater may indicate a heavy period.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in uterine size at week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
