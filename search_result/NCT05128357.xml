  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behçet's disease (BD) is an autoimmune, rare, and severe multisystemic inflammatory disease&#xD;
      characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, skin lesions, and both&#xD;
      anterior and posterior uveitis; articular, vascular, gastroenteric and neurological&#xD;
      involvement may also occur. The multi-organ involvement and the wide range of clinical&#xD;
      spectrum make the diagnosis of BD challenging. Adherence has been defined as the &quot;extent to&#xD;
      which a person's behavior (in terms of taking medications, following diets, or executing&#xD;
      other lifestyle changes) corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care&#xD;
      provider&quot;. The lack of medication adherence leads to poorer health outcomes for the patients,&#xD;
      which affect quality of life, generate economic loss for the healthcare system and trigger&#xD;
      uncertainty for the healthcare prescribers in dealing with the disease treatment. This&#xD;
      challenge is particularly important in BD. The present study is therefore aimed at exploring&#xD;
      the main reasons for low- or non-adherence to treatments in BD and to create a specific tool&#xD;
      able to catch and monitor the reasons for low- or non-adherence in BD over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to explore the unmet needs in treatment adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to create a toll aimed at identifying and monitoring the reasons of low treatment&#xD;
           adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to plan specific actions aimed at improving treatment adherence in BD&#xD;

      Methodology The methodology includes 5 consequent phases, summarized below. Phase A. Panel&#xD;
      creation - The first step foresees the creation of a multi-stakeholder panel, that will&#xD;
      include clinicians, BD patients' representatives, BD caregiver' representatives and other&#xD;
      experts (economists, psychologist, pharmacists, etc). The multi-stakeholder approach will&#xD;
      contribute to improve the identification of the different barriers, perspectives and unmet&#xD;
      needs of the different stakeholders and to identify the patients' outcomes to be included in&#xD;
      the tool. The panel will be created by launching an international call for interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B. Co-design process - An ad hoc survey will be created in co-design with the different&#xD;
      stakeholders in order to capture all the different dimensions, barriers and needs that are&#xD;
      involved in the process of treatment adherence, as well to ensure the accessibility and&#xD;
      understandability of the survey. The survey will include two main sections: one section with&#xD;
      questions and a section dedicated to narrative medicine, that will provide a limited space&#xD;
      for patients and caregivers to express their perspective, views, needs and priorities in&#xD;
      terms of treatment adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be translated in different languages to ensure a wide dissemination across&#xD;
      different countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase C. Launch of the survey - This phase foresees the upload of the survey into the EU&#xD;
      Survey and the launch of the survey across the different centers involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BD patients and caregivers will be able to access the survey online for at least 3 months in&#xD;
      order to reach the greatest number possible of respondents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase D. Data analysis, workshop and agreement - The answers to the questions and the&#xD;
      contributions provided in the narrative medicine section will be elaborated in order to&#xD;
      identify the main barriers and unmet needs related to treatment adherence in BD patients and&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, an online workshop will be organized in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elaborate and discuss the results of the survey;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  co-design and reach a formal agreement on the tool that will enable the identification&#xD;
           and the monitoring of BD treatment adherence during the clinical follow-up of BD&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase E. Pilot phase for validation - The final tool will then be translated in different&#xD;
      languages and will be adopted in a pilot phase that will involve at least 300 BD patients and&#xD;
      caregivers form different countries. The results of the pilot phase will be discussed in the&#xD;
      panel described in Phase A and the tool will be refined according to the results gathered in&#xD;
      the pilot. The final tool will then be published in a scientific paper and distributed to BD&#xD;
      experts and patients' organisations for adoption. In addition, based on the results of the&#xD;
      pilot phase, a list of future actions aimed at improving treatment adherence in BD patients&#xD;
      will be produced with the support of members of the co-design panel organized in Phase A.&#xD;
