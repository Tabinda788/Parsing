  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tremor in Parkinson's disease is a common and highly burdensome symptom. Recent evidence&#xD;
      shows that areas in the brain that are underlying Parkinson's tremor overlap with those that&#xD;
      respond to somatosensory stimulation. Applying such stimulation to the tremulous limb might&#xD;
      therefore influence tremor-related brain activity and thereby potentially reduce tremor. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators explore this possibility and investigate whether tremor&#xD;
      specific vibrotactile stimulation at the wrist of the most affected arm influences tremor&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, of which tremor&#xD;
      is a common and highly burdensome symptom. The pathophysiology of tremor involves a cerebral&#xD;
      network that consists of basal ganglia and a cerebello-thalamo-cortical motor circuit.&#xD;
      Emerging evidence suggests that somatosensory input from the tremulous limb to the brain may&#xD;
      influence this network. Specifically, tremor-related activity was observed in primary and&#xD;
      secondary somatosensory cortex, and thalamic cells involved in tremor appear to be responsive&#xD;
      to somatosensory stimulation as well. Somatosensory afferents may thus play a role in tremor&#xD;
      pathophysiology and could therefore be used as treatment target. Here, the investigators will&#xD;
      test this hypothesis by investigating the effect of modulating somatosensory input (with&#xD;
      vibrotactile stimulation) on tremor severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are 1) to test whether rhythmic somatosensory input (vibrotactile&#xD;
      stimulation) at tremor frequency reduces tremor power of Parkinson's tremor as compared to&#xD;
      vibrotactile stimulation at 1.5 times tremor frequency and 2) whether continuous 80Hz&#xD;
      vibrotactile stimulation reduces tremor power as compared to sham stimulation. As secondary&#xD;
      objectives, the investigators will test whether the effect of vibrotactile stimulation on&#xD;
      tremor power depends on the context in which tremor occurs (rest, cognitive coactivation,&#xD;
      posture), whether stimulation at tremor frequency reduces tremor power as compared to sham&#xD;
      stimulation, and whether vibrotactile stimulation has an effect on two other common PD&#xD;
      symptoms: impaired gait and bradykinesia. The investigators will include 27 patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease and rest as well as postural tremor. The intervention involves subtle&#xD;
      mechanical vibrations on the wrist or ankles. This is a non-invasive and painless way to&#xD;
      provide somatosensory stimuli, in a continuous (80Hz) or rhythmic fashion (brief bursts of 80&#xD;
      Hz at tremor or step frequency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that this study will provide mechanistic insights into if and how&#xD;
      somatosensory (vibro-tactile) afferents influence the cerebral tremor circuit in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, and may provide a solid basis for designing further clinical treatment studies.&#xD;

    <description>All participants receive vibrotactile stimulation at three different stimulation settings as well as one sham condition. Specifically, stimulation is applied at (1) brief bursts of 80Hz that occur at the individual tremor frequency, (2) 80Hz bursts at tremor frequency*1.5, and (3) continuous stimulation at 80Hz. The sham condition does not involve any stimulation. All of the stimulations will be applied under three different contextual manipulations: during rest, posture and cognitive coactivation (serial subtraction task). Within each context, stimulation/sham conditions are applied in random order.</description>
