  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As periodontitis is known to add to the systemic inflammatory burden and may consequently&#xD;
      contribute to progression of PCOS and vice-versa, So, controlling local and systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory burden by scaling and root planing and medical treatment may have an effect in&#xD;
      the management of PCOS women having periodontitis.There is no data as yet, comparing the&#xD;
      impact of COCs along with non surgical therapy and COCs along with just oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions on the periodontal health of PCOS patients. Therefore, there is need to study&#xD;
      the effect of combined oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol/norethisterone acetate) along&#xD;
      with non-surgical periodontal therapy on periodontal status and high sensitivity C-Reactive&#xD;
      Protein in polycystic ovary syndrome women having stage 1,2 periodontitis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various studies have been conducted to assess the impact of oral contraceptives on&#xD;
      periodontal status and mostly present conflicting results. However, none of these studies&#xD;
      have been carried out on females diagnosed with PCOS. Such an assessment is significant&#xD;
      keeping in mind the increasing prevalence of PCOS as well as introduction of low-dose oral&#xD;
      contraceptives for the long-term management of these patients. Additionally, periodontitis is&#xD;
      known to increase the systemic inflammatory burden and may possibly contribute to progression&#xD;
      of PCOS and vice-versa. So, controlling both local and systemic inflammatory burden by&#xD;
      scaling and root planing along with medical treatment may have a vital role in the management&#xD;
      of PCOS women having periodontitis. There is no data as yet, evaluating the impact of COCs on&#xD;
      the periodontal health of PCOS patients. Therefore, the effect of hormone based medical&#xD;
      treatment on the periodontal status of these patients, whether protective or destructive,&#xD;
      remains unclear till date. The present study, thus, aims to evaluate the effect of combined&#xD;
      oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol / norethisterone acetate) with and without non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy on the periodontal status and the levels of serological marker of&#xD;
      inflammation {high sensitivity-C Reactive Protein (hsCRP)} among polycystic ovarian syndrome&#xD;
      (PCOS) women having periodontitis stage 1/2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING- The present randomised controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in the Department of Periodontology, Post Graduate Institute of&#xD;
      Dental Sciences, Rohtak in collaboration with Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Post&#xD;
      Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PERIOD- 12-14 months STUDY SUBJECTS- PCOS patients having periodontitis,15-40 years of&#xD;
      age and systemically healthy patients with periodontitis All the participants will be age and&#xD;
      BMI matched. The present Randomized Controlled Trial will include 60 individuals of PCOS who&#xD;
      will be divided into 2 groups using randomisation software. Generating randomization&#xD;
      table.and allocation will be concealed in opaque envelops by another person not involved in&#xD;
      the trial.30 systemically healthy females,age and BMI matched, will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group 1 , n=30, patients with PCOS on combined oral contraceptives (COCs) having stage&#xD;
      1/2 periodontitis will receive oral hygiene instructions (OHI) and SRP Test group 2, n=30,&#xD;
      patients with PCOS on combined oral contraceptives (COCs) having stage 1/2 periodontitis will&#xD;
      receive oral hygiene instructions only Control Group , n=30, Systemically Healthy (age and&#xD;
      BMI matched) females with stage 1/2 periodontitis will receive with OHI and SRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal and anthropometric parameters will be measured and sampling will be done at&#xD;
      baseline, 3months and 6 months. serum hsCRP levels will be assessed at baseline and at 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data recorded will be processed by standard&#xD;
      statistical analysis.The normality of distribution of data will be examined by Shapiro Wilk&#xD;
      test. Statistical analysis will be performed according to distribution of data. If it is in&#xD;
      normal distribution inter group comparison will be done by using Independent T test and&#xD;
      paired t test will be use for intragroup comparison and if non-normal distribution of data,&#xD;
      inter group comparison will be done by Mann-Whitney U test and intragroup by signed rank&#xD;
      test. The Chi square test will be applied to analyze categoric data. Correlation and&#xD;
      association between predictors and dependent variables will be analyzed by correlation&#xD;
      analysis and regression analysis.&#xD;
