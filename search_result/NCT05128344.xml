&#xD;
          -  Participant has received any prior treatment for IS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been previously treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH),&#xD;
             corticosteroids, or Vigabatrin for seizures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids for an&#xD;
             indication other than seizures within 30 days prior to Screening&#xD;
