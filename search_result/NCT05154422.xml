  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The popularity of marathons and endurance events has increased over the last few decades and,&#xD;
      interestingly, the demographics of participants have also changed. From 1980 to 2002 the&#xD;
      average race time to complete the marathon lengthened from ~3.5 hours to ~4.5 hours.&#xD;
      Likewise, many endurance races include &quot;Clydesdale&quot; and &quot;Athena&quot; divisions for heavier weight&#xD;
      male and female runners, respectively. As such, there has been an increase of overweight and&#xD;
      obese participants in these races. For example, one study consisting of 250 runners&#xD;
      determined, according to BMI, that approximately 15% and 31% of the female and male&#xD;
      participants, respectively, were classified as overweight, with 31% and 33% classified as&#xD;
      obese. Therefore, many recreational endurance athletes are overweight despite their high&#xD;
      level of activity. On one hand, these data are positive as regular exercise reduces&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in overweight and obese populations. Yet, it&#xD;
      is well documented in sedentary obese individuals that excess adiposity can lead to&#xD;
      disturbances in adipocyte lipolysis and altered substrate utilization at rest and during&#xD;
      exercise, and can decrease muscle quality. However, it is unknown if overweight individuals&#xD;
      that exercise regularly have disrupted fat metabolism, circulating hormones, or muscle&#xD;
      quality. No study has directly determined if differences exist in fat metabolism, circulating&#xD;
      hormones, and muscle quality between overweight recreational female athletes and their lean&#xD;
      counterparts when training status is equivalent. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation&#xD;
      is to determine if differences in pre and post-exercise fat metabolism, circulating insulin&#xD;
      and growth hormone, and muscle quality exist between active overweight individuals compared&#xD;
      to active lean individuals with similar training history and who have regularly trained for&#xD;
      and participated in endurance events within the last few years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fourteen active female endurance athletes (8 lower body fat, 6 higher body fat) will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in this study. The study will consist of two experimental days at&#xD;
      the Institute of Sports Science and Medicine (ISSM) and the Sandels building at Florida State&#xD;
      University. Participants will arrive at the laboratory in a fasted state for laboratory&#xD;
      testing days. All participants will fill out a health history questionnaire, physical&#xD;
      activity questionnaire, and sign the informed consent before any testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Day 1 of testing, participants will arrive in the morning at ISSM for informed consent,&#xD;
      anthropometric testing, body composition, resting blood pressure, and fitness testing. All&#xD;
      testing will be overseen by a certified strength and conditioning specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric and body composition measurements will be assessed on the first day in the lab&#xD;
      to ensure inclusion criteria are met. Height and weight will be measured with a wall-mounted&#xD;
      stadiometer (SECA, Hamburg, Germany) and a digital scale (Detecto®, Webb City, MO, USA)&#xD;
      respectively, and used to calculate body mass index (BMI: kg/m2). Fat-free mass, fat mass,&#xD;
      and percent body fat will be assessed by Bod Pod (Cosmed, Chicago, IL) following the&#xD;
      manufactures instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitness Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A submaximal YMCA cycle ergometer (Monarch, Kroons väg, Vansbro, Sverige) test will be used&#xD;
      to assess the current fitness levels. In accordance with COVID-19 precautions, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the test on an ergometer outdoors of the ISSM laboratory and&#xD;
      maintain PPE and social distancing as previously described. The test consists of three to&#xD;
      four, three-minute stages. The first stage of the test starts with the participants pedaling&#xD;
      against the resistance of 0.5 kg (150 kgm/min) at 50 rpm. Heart rate will be recorded at the&#xD;
      end of each minute and if the second and third-minute measurements are within five beats of&#xD;
      each other the researcher will adjust the resistance depending on the last heart rate&#xD;
      recorded (&lt;80 bpm = 2.5 kg, 80 - 90 bpm = 2.0 kg, 90 - 100 bpm = 1.5 kg, and &gt;100 bpm = 1.0&#xD;
      kg). The participant will continue to pedal at 50 rpm through each of the stages and each&#xD;
      stage following stage two will increase by 0.5 kg. The test concludes when two heart rate&#xD;
      readings (between 110 and 150) have been collected in two different stages. The heart rate&#xD;
      measurements and intensity for the two stages will be used to estimate the participant's&#xD;
      VO2peak using the following equations: VO2max (ml/kg/min) = a (HRmax - HR2) + VO22, &quot;a&quot; is&#xD;
      the slope of the line created by the HR and VO2 in the two stages of the test169. Before the&#xD;
      test, participants will be fitted with a chest strap heart rate monitor and watch receiver&#xD;
      (Polar, Lake Success, NY) which will continuously record the heart rate for the duration of&#xD;
      the test. Participants will also be asked to rate their perceived exertion throughout the&#xD;
      test. A Borg scale ranging from 6 to 20, 6 being equivalent to resting and 20 being&#xD;
      equivalent to maximal effort, to determine how hard they felt they were working during the&#xD;
      fitness test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compositional Muscle Quality Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a standard 20-minute rest period, participants will be asked to sit on an&#xD;
      examination table. Images of the rectus femoris will be taken midway between the inguinal&#xD;
      crease and the proximal aspect of the patella using ultrasound. The intramuscular fat&#xD;
      percentage of the rectus femoris will be assessed via analysis of the ultrasound echo&#xD;
      intensity and related calculations. All parameters of the sonograph unit (depth, gain, etc.)&#xD;
      will be kept constant between each participant. The average of the two measurements will be&#xD;
      used to quantify echo intensity. Echo intensity of the measurements will be quantified via&#xD;
      Adobe Photoshop histogram analysis (San Jose, CA) and will be used to estimate the&#xD;
      intramuscular fat percentage using the following equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females: y = [(0.062) • (40 • z + x)] + 7.901 Males: y = [(0.114) • (40 • z + x) + 1.126]&#xD;
&#xD;
      *x = raw echo intensity, y = intermuscular fat percent, z = subcutaneous adipose thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Muscle Quality Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional measurements of the rectus femoris (ultrasound measurements) with the&#xD;
      isokinetic strength test will be used to calculate functional muscle quality (FMQ = N-m/mm2).&#xD;
      Force production will be accessed via isokinetic dynamometry (Biodex Medical Systems Inc,&#xD;
      Shirley, NY) using knee extension and flexion at 60º/s for strength testing. Participants&#xD;
      will perform 2 sets of 3 reps, the peak power of the sets will be used as the measurement of&#xD;
      maximal force production (N-m). A 2-minute rest will be given between sets. Isokinetic&#xD;
      testing is not a usual mode of exercise as it requires equipment generally only found in a&#xD;
      lab setting. Likewise, the specific test we will be conducting requires a very short period&#xD;
      of time during physical exertion. The test does not increase minute ventilation, as it will&#xD;
      take approximately 15 seconds per set for a total of 30 seconds of exercise. Therefore, this&#xD;
      test will not increase the risk of COVID-19 spread. However, to reduce any possible risk of&#xD;
      spreading COVID-19 participants will be required to wear a face-covering during this test, as&#xD;
      well as social distancing protocols are being followed by the investigation team during the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-Day Lifestyle Measurements At the end of the testing on this day, the participants will be&#xD;
      given a packet with food and exercise logs, accelerometers (Actigraph WGT3X-BT, Pensacola,&#xD;
      FL), and fatigue science bands (Vancouver, BC, Canada) to use over the following seven days.&#xD;
      The information packet will also contain contact information to the research team in case a&#xD;
      problem should arise with any of the equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the next 7 days, participants will keep track of their daily training routines by&#xD;
      recording their distance, time to completion, and the rate of perceived exertion for the&#xD;
      training session. They will wear an accelerometer (Actigraph WGT3X-BT, Pensacola, FL) to&#xD;
      record their non-structured physical activity, and a fatigue science band (Vancouver, BC,&#xD;
      Canada) to track sleep duration and quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also fill out food logs for all seven days for quantifying their normal&#xD;
      diet. Information from the food logs will be analyzed (The Food Processor© Nutrition Analysis&#xD;
      Software from ESHA Research, Salem, Oregon) for caloric and macronutrient (carbohydrate,&#xD;
      protein and fat) content Training logs will be used by the participants to record their&#xD;
      training sessions. The information recorded will be distance, duration, and session rate of&#xD;
      perceived exertion. Accelerometers will be used to account for non-structured physical&#xD;
      activity and quantify potential differences in sedentary time. Fatigue science bands will be&#xD;
      used to record sleep quality, latency, and duration. All these parameters will be used to&#xD;
      explore potential differences between the two groups and allow for potential covariate&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 7-day period of at-home data collection, participants will report back to the lab&#xD;
      for the second day of testing (occurring no more the 10 days after day 1). Participants will&#xD;
      arrive in the morning at the ISSM for microdialysis testing, metabolic measurements,&#xD;
      exercise, and blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipolytic Response to Exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two microdialysis probes will be inserted percutaneously 5 - 10 cm lateral to the umbilicus&#xD;
      for collection of interstitial glycerol for quantification of lipolysis. The microdialysis&#xD;
      probes will be perfused with a solution of 0.9% sodium chloride and ~10 mM ethanol (for blood&#xD;
      flow quantification) at 2.0 µL/min9,122. Interstitial glycerol concentration will be&#xD;
      calculated via the following equation similar to other studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gly in vivo = (Gly dialysate (1 - EtOH dialysate/perfusate) / (in vitro EtOH relative&#xD;
      recovery / in vitro Gly relative recovery) After a 45-minute microdialysis probe&#xD;
      equilibration period, resting dialysate will be collected for a total of 60 minutes&#xD;
      (collection vials changed every 15 minutes). Next, participants will complete a 45-minute&#xD;
      cycle ergometer (Velotron, Sram, Chicago, IL) ride (outside of the ISSM laboratory in open&#xD;
      air) at 70% of their estimated VO2peak. Participants will be allowed to pedal at a&#xD;
      conformable cadence as the ergometer will maintain watts despite RPMs. During the ride,&#xD;
      participants will be given 125 ml of water every 15 minutes. One dialysate collection will&#xD;
      occur immediately following the completion of the ride. Dialysate will then be collected for&#xD;
      120 minutes after physical activity (collection vials changed every 15 minutes). Participants&#xD;
      will be allowed to sit up and read quietly in the lab for all post-physical activity data&#xD;
      collection. Fat oxidation will be measured via indirect calorimetry for 30 minutes pre and&#xD;
      immediately post-exercise, and again for the last 30 minutes of the 120-minute post-exercise.&#xD;
      Dialysate will be stored at 4ºC for analysis of ethanol within 24 hrs. and subsequently&#xD;
      stored at -80ºC until batch analysis of all dialysate glycerol samples (CMA600, Solna,&#xD;
      Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microdialysis Ethanol Outflow/Inflow Ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethanol (~10 mM) will be included with the perfusion medium to monitor adipose tissue blood&#xD;
      flow in the area of the microdialysis probe9. Ethanol diffuses over the dialysis membrane and&#xD;
      is not metabolized in adipose tissue to any significant extent. The Ethanol is transported&#xD;
      away from the local area by the microcirculatory blood flow in the immediate vicinity of the&#xD;
      probe membrane. An enzymatic fluorometric method is used to measurement the ethanol in the&#xD;
      perfusate and dialysate. Blood flow will be expressed as a ratio of the ethanol concentration&#xD;
      in the dialysate (outflow) and the ethanol concentration in the perfusate (inflow):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethanol outflow/inflow ratio = [ethanol dialysate]/[ethanol perfusate] The ethanol&#xD;
      outflow/inflow ratio is inversely related to the local adipose tissue blood flow. Indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry using a Parvo metabolic cart (TrueOne 2400; Parvomedics; Salt Lake City, UT) will&#xD;
      be used to measure resting energy expenditure and determine whole-body fat oxidation at rest&#xD;
      and post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Procedures and Exercise Stimulus Seventy-five minutes after insertion of the&#xD;
      microdialysis probes, participants will be asked to lie in a supine position for 30 minutes&#xD;
      to measure resting energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio, for quantification of&#xD;
      whole-body fat oxidation at rest. Following resting metabolic measurements, participants will&#xD;
      be escorted outside of the lab to the track. Participants will be instructed through a&#xD;
      standardized dynamic warm-up lasting about five minutes (appendix A). The participants will&#xD;
      then be instructed to ride on a monarch cycle ergometer maintaining 90 revolutions per minute&#xD;
      for 45 minutes. The resistance will be set to elicit about 2 - 3 watts per kilogram of lean&#xD;
      body mass, set to correspond with approximately 70% estimated VO2peak. In accordance with&#xD;
      COVID-19 precautions, the warm-up and cycling will be performed while maintaining a safe and&#xD;
      recommended social distance (at least 6 feet). Immediately after the cycling bout the&#xD;
      participant will be escorted back into the lab and will be asked to lie down in a supine&#xD;
      position for 30 minutes of continuous gas collection for measurement of post-exercise energy&#xD;
      expenditure, respiratory exchange ratio, and fat oxidation. These measurements will be taken&#xD;
      again in the same supine position for 30 minutes at the end of the 120-minute post-exercise&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating Hormone Changes to Exercise Venous blood samples, via an antecubital vein, will&#xD;
      be collected to measure concentrations of insulin, human growth hormone, atrial natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide, and glucose. A total of three blood draws will be collected, during the&#xD;
      microdialysis testing day immediately before and after the exercise bout, as well as 120&#xD;
      minutes post-exercise. Plasma insulin and growth hormone will be compared between groups and&#xD;
      used as a covariate for lipolytic action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood will be collected in heparin-coated plasma vacutainers and will be centrifuged for&#xD;
      15 min at 3,500 rpm at 4 °C and aliquots plasma will be stored at -80°C for later batch&#xD;
      analysis to limit day-to-day assay variability. Capillary blood glucose and HbA1c via a&#xD;
      finger stick will be measured with a hand-held glucometer (OneTouch Ultra, LifeScan Europe,&#xD;
      CH), and a DCA Vantage analyzer (Siemens, Tarrytown, NY), respectively. Plasma insulin (R&amp;D&#xD;
      systems, DINS00, Minneapolis, MN) and human growth hormone (R&amp;D systems, DGH00, Minneapolis,&#xD;
      MN) will be assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions. Blood will be drawn immediately following metabolic testing for resting&#xD;
      measurements, immediately after the cycling bout, and at 120 minutes post-exercise.&#xD;
