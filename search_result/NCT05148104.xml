  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positioning of the glenoid component is one of the most challenging steps in shoulder&#xD;
      replacement surgery. Prosthesis longevity and functional outcomes are considered highly&#xD;
      dependent on accurate positioning. Currently, there are no adequate means to verify the&#xD;
      position of the glenoid component during surgery which is a significant impediment to&#xD;
      accurate positioning. We propose a non-interventional study to validate a novel technology&#xD;
      for verifying the position of the glenoid component during shoulder replacement surgery.&#xD;

      Positioning of the glenoid component is one of the most challenging steps in shoulder&#xD;
      replacement surgery. In this study, we are testing a new method of checking the glenoid&#xD;
      component position using an optical light 3D scanner for both total and reverse total&#xD;
      shoulder replacements. Currently, the position of the glenoid component is verified by the&#xD;
      operating surgeon visually and there is no routine imaging to verify the position of the&#xD;
      glenoid component during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will have a 3D optical image of their glenoid bone taken during&#xD;
      the surgical procedure. Taking this image will require less than 3 minutes and the image will&#xD;
      only include their surgical wound (no facial features or other identifying features will be&#xD;
      taken in the images). Two to six weeks after the surgery, the study participants will have CT&#xD;
      scan of their replaced shoulder. This will allow the researchers to measure the accuracy of&#xD;
      the new imaging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that about 14 people will participate in this study at Sunnybrook. The&#xD;
      length of this study for participants is 6 weeks. The entire study is expected to take about&#xD;
      1 year to complete and the results should be known 6 months after study completion.&#xD;
