  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder carcinoma is the 9th most prevalent cancer worldwide and the 13th most common cause&#xD;
      of cancer-related deaths. Approximately three quarters of all cases are diagnosed in men.&#xD;
      Lack of understanding of mechanisms that govern bladder carcinoma metastasis and recurrence&#xD;
      is a major reason for its high mortality rates. CXCL5 is a small (8-14 kDa) protein that is a&#xD;
      member of the CXC chemokine family. It is an inflammatory and angiogenic chemokine that binds&#xD;
      to its cell-surface receptor CXCR2 to execute its roles in angiogenesis, immune response,&#xD;
      tumor progression and invasion by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway-induced up regulation of&#xD;
      matrix metalloproteinase. Numerous reports have indicated that CXCL5 plays vital roles in&#xD;
      cancer progression in various neoplasms; abnormal expression of CXCL5 has been identified in&#xD;
      many tumors. Increased expression of CXCL5 is associated with advanced tumor stages, local&#xD;
      invasion, metastatic potential and cancer-related inflammation, which is involved in many&#xD;
      aspects of malignancy in cancer biology. Recent studies have revealed that CXCL5 could serve&#xD;
      as a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with bladder carcinoma.&#xD;

      Bladder carcinoma is the 9th most prevalent cancer worldwide and the 13th most common cause&#xD;
      of cancer-related deaths. Approximately three quarters of all cases are diagnosed in men; it&#xD;
      constitutes the 5th most common cancer in men. There are different histological variants of&#xD;
      bladder carcinomas which show different phenotypic, biological and prognostic impacts. The&#xD;
      most common histological type of bladder carcinoma is urothelial carcinoma (UC) which&#xD;
      constitutes about 90% of all bladder cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      and other rare types represent the remaining 10%. Cigarette smoking is the most important&#xD;
      risk factor for UC, followed by environmental pollution, occupational exposure to&#xD;
      carcinogens, urinary tract infections, chronic inflammations and irradiations .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder carcinoma is divided into three diagnostically different categories; non-muscle&#xD;
      invasive, muscle invasive and metastatic bladder carcinoma. Bladder carcinoma mortality is&#xD;
      mainly determined by the initial tumor stage and success of treatment, reflected by&#xD;
      progression rates of high risk non-muscle invasive UC and cure rates of muscle-invasive UC.&#xD;
      Clinicopathological parameters play a major role in determining the therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      for UC, but are usually not reliable predictors of prognosis. Therefore, studying novel&#xD;
      biomarkers that have a potential value as prognostic markers and serve as new therapeutic&#xD;
      targets is required .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Egypt, bladder carcinoma is considered the third most common cancer in both sexes&#xD;
      representing 6.9% of total malignancies with the highest mortality rates worldwide. Infection&#xD;
      by S. haematopium and Cigarette smoking are the most important risk factors of bladder&#xD;
      carcinoma in Egypt. Due to efforts to eradicate S. haematopium and treat infected patients in&#xD;
      the past three decades, there is decrease in the incidence of SCC. However, the incidence of&#xD;
      UC rising from 16% to 65.8%, becoming at present the most common tumor type due to increased&#xD;
      exposure to etiological factors as smoking, pesticides and other causative agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of understanding of mechanisms that govern bladder carcinoma metastasis and recurrence&#xD;
      is a major reason for its high mortality rates. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play&#xD;
      irreplaceable roles in migration and invasion, which are mediated by many signal pathways&#xD;
      including MAPK/P38 signaling, PI3K/AKT signaling and Wnt/Frizzled signaling accompanied by&#xD;
      epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), drug resistance and tumor progression. Therefore,&#xD;
      development of new therapeutic strategies for bladder carcinoma may lie in understanding the&#xD;
      roles that these signaling pathways play in tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CXCL5 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5), also named epithelial-neutrophil activating&#xD;
      peptide-78 (ENA-78), is a small (8-14 kDa) protein that is a member of the CXC chemokine&#xD;
      family. It is an inflammatory and angiogenic chemokine that binds to its cell-surface&#xD;
      receptor CXCR2 to execute its roles in angiogenesis, immune response, tumor progression and&#xD;
      invasion by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway-induced up regulation of matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase. Numerous reports have indicated that CXCL5 plays vital roles in cancer&#xD;
      progression in various neoplasms; abnormal expression of CXCL5 has been identified in many&#xD;
      tumors. It is overexpressed in gastric cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer,&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Increased expression of CXCL5 is associated&#xD;
      with advanced tumor stages, local invasion, metastatic potential and cancer-related&#xD;
      inflammation, which is involved in many aspects of malignancy in cancer biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though studying the Immunohistochemical expression of CXCL5 in bladder carcinoma to assess&#xD;
      its role in tumor cell proliferation, migration and spread is debatable. Recent studies have&#xD;
      revealed that CXCL5 could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with bladder&#xD;
      carcinoma. However, its prognostic value is still controversial owing to the fact that most&#xD;
      studies reported so far are limited in discrete outcome and sample size. Therefore, Knowledge&#xD;
      about the role of CXCL5 in UC progression, invasion and metastasis, and its prognostic&#xD;
      significance needs further elucidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of This Work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression of CXCL5 in non-invasive and invasive&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder and to correlate its expression to different&#xD;
      studied histopathological parameters to evaluate its potential prognostic value.&#xD;
