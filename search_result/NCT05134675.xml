    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators aim to reveal the harmful effects of increasing consumption of&#xD;
      homemade beer in recent years on the urinary tract. The high amount of carbonyl compounds in&#xD;
      the content of homemade beer has been proven by studies. In this study, which will be&#xD;
      conducted in the form of a questionnaire, it is aimed to evaluate the effects of the&#xD;
      consumption of homemade beer and the long-term exposure of the urinary system to carbonyl&#xD;
      compounds.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Homemade and craft beers are perceived as a popular alternative to beers produced on a larger&#xD;
      scale in recent years, due to the choice of consumers according to different taste&#xD;
      preferences and the raw materials used for brewing. According to nationally representative&#xD;
      survey data from the American Homebrewers Association (AHA), the U.S. had an estimated 1.1&#xD;
      million homebrew brewers in 2017, with annual homebrew beer production in excess of 1.4&#xD;
      million barrels (about 1% of annual U.S. beer production). Again in 2017, 40% of home brewers&#xD;
      started production within the last 4 years. Due to the prohibitions that have arisen due to&#xD;
      the pandemic all over the world, the production of homemade beer has reached its peak today.&#xD;
      In recent years, home-made beer consumption has gained popularity in parallel with&#xD;
      low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beers, which are prone to microbial spoilage, due to the ease&#xD;
      of access to the material, financial returns and hobby acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homemade beer is typically more susceptible to spoilage as it is not pasteurized or sterile&#xD;
      filtered. The microbiota, which is associated with organic raw materials, fruits, herbs,&#xD;
      honey, spices and vegetables, and non-traditional starch-rich ingredients added to produce&#xD;
      different aromas and flavors, increases the risk of spoilage. In addition, home brewers often&#xD;
      lack the advantages of a sophisticated microbiological laboratory, and optimal temperature&#xD;
      control during brewing and storage cannot be guaranteed. In addition to the fermentation&#xD;
      conditions (time and temperature), yeast strain and mash composition (types of grain used in&#xD;
      malting, mashing/boiling conditions) can also affect the chemical profile of beer, resulting&#xD;
      in a wide variety of components. Carbonyl compounds [acetaldehyde, acrolein, ethyl carbamate&#xD;
      (EC) and formaldehyde] are particularly toxic compounds that can occur. Acetaldehyde,&#xD;
      acrolein, and formaldehyde are highly reactive due to their electrophilic nature, so they&#xD;
      easily react with biological nucleophilic targets such as proteins, RNA, and DNA.&#xD;
