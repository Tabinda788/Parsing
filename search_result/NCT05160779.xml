  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: A pandemic such as the SRAS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has a great negative socioeconomic&#xD;
      impact with very limited therapeutic options. As with any disease, a detailed understanding&#xD;
      of its pathophysiological mechanisms is critical for the development of new therapies. In&#xD;
      SRAS-CoV-2, few studies have verified a possible relationship of these vasoactive peptide&#xD;
      polymorphisms with patient prognosis. Objective: To analyze and relate polymorphisms found in&#xD;
      components of vasoactive peptide systems in DNA samples collected from patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) who developed severe conditions and patients infected with mild or&#xD;
      asymptomatic conditions. Methodology: Cross-sectional, analytical and qualitative study that&#xD;
      will be conducted with approximately 151 participants previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      with mild or asymptomatic forms of the pathology, diagnosed in primary care in the city of&#xD;
      Guarulhos/SP- specifically in the Basic Health Unit of Nova Saúde Bonsucesso- well with&#xD;
      participants who were diagnosed with the severe forms that required hospitalization in 2021.&#xD;
      For the collection of biological material, a sterile swab will be used in order to collect&#xD;
      cells from the oral cavity, specifically from the oral mucosa. Expected results: We hope to&#xD;
      identify and relate the polymorphisms of vasoactive peptide genes from patients with mild,&#xD;
      asymptomatic or severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus contributing to the understanding&#xD;
      of the different clinical evolutions of the disease.&#xD;

      Cross-sectional, analytical and qualitative study that will be carried out with approximately&#xD;
      151 participants who were previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 with mild and severe symptoms&#xD;
      of the pathology, diagnosed in primary care in the city of Guarulhos/SP - specifically in the&#xD;
      Basic Health Unit Nova Bonsucesso or who have a history of previous admissions - requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization in the year 2021 (which will be removed from the COVID case monitoring&#xD;
      spreadsheet available at the study UBS). Cells will be collected from the participants' oral&#xD;
      cavity using a sterile cotton swab. The collections will be carried out at the Basic Health&#xD;
      Unit Nova Bonsucesso, located in the city of Guarulhos/SP (mild/asymptomatic cases), under&#xD;
      the supervision and responsibility of the dentist and collaborator of this Leonardo Paroche&#xD;
      de Matos project. The Free and Informed Consent Form will be filled out and signed after&#xD;
      guidance on the research and its subsequent acceptance by the participant.&#xD;
