  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mila-Learn-01 is a double-blind clinical study (meaning that neither the patient nor the&#xD;
      doctor or his/her team will know which game the child has), which enables us to see the&#xD;
      effect of a serious game on the child's reading skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who will participate in this research will receive, at random, one of the two&#xD;
      serious study games, the experimental game (Mila-Learn) or the placebo game (Mila-Placebo).&#xD;
      The tasks designed in the placebo game mirror those of Mila-Learn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each game comprises eight tasks to be completed on a touchscreen tablet. Each session lasts&#xD;
      25 minutes (±20%); five training sessions lasting 25 minutes are planned per week for eight&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a randomised, double-blind clinical trial with a control group to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the Mila-Learn game on children's skills. In order to maintain the&#xD;
      blinding of the patient and his/her family, the study will be presented to them as evaluating&#xD;
      the effect of serious games on a child's learning without explaining that the study is&#xD;
      specifically interested in the Mila-Learn game, music and rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child included in the study will be randomised:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  either to the experimental group (EXPE Group) and in this case will receive the&#xD;
           Mila-Learn game&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or to the control group (CONT Group) and will receive the Mila-Placebo game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomisation list will be edited by the statistician. It will allow us to know whether the&#xD;
      patient will be in the experimental arm or the control arm when sending out the tablets,&#xD;
      depending on the chronological order of the inclusions, so that we can send the corresponding&#xD;
      tablet to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, the children will follow the same training protocol consisting of five&#xD;
      training sessions per week on the game corresponding to their group. Each game comprises 8&#xD;
      tasks to be completed on a touchscreen tablet. Each session lasts 25 minutes (±20%).&#xD;
