  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 22% of children in Philadelphia live in food-insecure (FI) households, often leading&#xD;
      to reliance on inexpensive, nutrient-poor foods and associated poor health outcomes. Despite&#xD;
      this, utilization of food benefit programs is often low, including the Special Supplemental&#xD;
      Nutrition Program Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Farmer's Market Nutrition Program&#xD;
      (FMNP). In the prior qualitative study, Investigators found that parents desire to increase&#xD;
      their children's intake of produce but face many barriers to produce access; caregivers&#xD;
      described a preference for delivery-based, low-or-no cost food programs to increase produce&#xD;
      access and intake among children. This pilot trial seeks to assess the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      short-term, tiered-fee produce delivery program in retaining participants and increasing&#xD;
      produce access and intake among families with WIC-eligible children&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are piloting a produce box delivery program to approximately 50 WIC-eligible,&#xD;
      low-income families in West Philadelphia in partnership with the Farm to Families Initiative&#xD;
      (St. Christopher's Foundation for Children) and Food Connect, a local food delivery program.&#xD;
      Both partnerships have been previously established and are maintained through the Office of&#xD;
      Community Relations. The program will be 8 weeks in duration; in the first 4 weeks, all&#xD;
      families will receive a free, weekly produce box from Farm to Families. In the second two&#xD;
      weeks, the 50 families will be randomized into two groups, each with 25 participants. One&#xD;
      group will be asked to pay $5 for the produce box and the other group will pay $10, using&#xD;
      food benefits or their own income. Recipes that include foods in the produce box will be&#xD;
      included with the delivery along with children's activities (books, coloring pages, card&#xD;
      games, etc.) related to fruits and vegetables. Participating parents will complete three&#xD;
      online surveys throughout the program. These pre-, mid-, and post-intervention surveys will&#xD;
      assess the effect of the program and participant satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected goals are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect of different pricing models on participation of low-income,&#xD;
           WIC-eligible families in a produce delivery program&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy of a low-cost produce delivery program to increase perceived&#xD;
           intake of produce among low-income young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate efficacy of a low-cost produce delivery program to increase perceived access to&#xD;
           produce among low-income families in West Philadelphia.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Potential subjects will initially be recruited from a list of 30 parents who participated in the previous IRB-exempt, qualitative study (IRB 20-017497 - Fresh Start) and consented to be re-contacted for future studies. The remaining subjects will be recruited from a list of families who received a WIC prescription for their child(ren) from a provider at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Cobbs Creek between 2019-2020; this list was obtained via IT query of Epic for our prior study. No medical records will be accessed for screening for this study. Potential subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria during the initial recruitment call.</intervention_model_description>
