  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of people in the US misuse opioids each year, leading to thousands of deaths and&#xD;
      costing billions of dollars in total economic burden. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for&#xD;
      opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious, but only a fraction of OUD persons access&#xD;
      MAT, and treatment non-adherence is common and associated with poor outcomes. This STTR Fast&#xD;
      Track proposal is designed to increase rates of Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) treatment&#xD;
      initiation and adherence among OUD patients recruited from emergency and inpatient acute&#xD;
      care. To accomplish these aims, the project will enhance the Opioid Addiction Recovery&#xD;
      Support (OARS), an existing Q2i company technology, with a new evidence-based reward,&#xD;
      contingency management (CM) function. CM interventions systematically reward (reinforce)&#xD;
      specific behaviors like treatment initiation and adherence with therapy attendance and&#xD;
      drug-free urine tests and are highly efficacious. An OARS solution enhanced with a CM&#xD;
      component (OARSCM) that allows for the automatic calculation, delivery, and redemption of&#xD;
      rewards contingent on objective evidence of treatment behaviors may be key to improving&#xD;
      Suboxone initiation and adherence. In Phase 1 of this proposal, the existing OARS clinician&#xD;
      portal and patient mobile application will be modified to accommodate entry into the software&#xD;
      system from an acute care setting and to automatically manage and deliver rewards to create&#xD;
      OARSCM using patient-centered design principles. Focus groups with OUD patients and other key&#xD;
      stakeholders will inform design. Primary usability outcomes will be examined, and the program&#xD;
      iteratively updated. After meeting milestones, there was a proof-of-concept pilot of&#xD;
      usability, acceptability, and effects on initial behavior targets with approximately 20&#xD;
      patients and at least 4 providers.&#xD;

    <description>After successful completion of usability testing (Patients: n=11, Providers: n=4), a proof-of-concept field test was completed. OARSCM patients (n = 10) received TAU procedures during enrollment (SBIRT for opioid use disorder and a warm handoff to outpatient MOUD treatment). TAU outpatient MOUD treatment consists of urine toxicology (Utox) screening, group/individual therapy, and MOUD prescription. Treatment visits are typically weekly in weeks 1-4 and taper over time. Patients earned chances for prizes, for targeted behaviors, which escalated for each targeted behavior in a row, with reset criteria. For scheduling a MOUD treatment intake, patients will earn 2 chances for prizes. Chances for prizes will increase by 2 chances with each targeted behavior in a row up to a max of 10 draws/targeted behavior. There are 18 targeted behaviors during the 4-week field test (schedule intake, complete intake, 4 opioid-negative Utox/week plus bonuses for cocaine-negative Utox, and 4 therapy/week).</description>
