  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MRG002 in patients with HER2-mutated unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of two stages: efficacy exploration and efficacy verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first stage, at most 30 patients will be enrolled for each of the two cohorts as&#xD;
      defined by HER2 mutation sites. If ≥8 patients achieved objective response, the second stage&#xD;
      will be continued; otherwise the trial will be terminated. Approximately 40 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the second stage.&#xD;
