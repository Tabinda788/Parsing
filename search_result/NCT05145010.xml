  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, extension (OLE) study to evaluate the long-term&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of infigratinib, an FGFR 1-3-selective tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor, in subjects with ACH who previously completed a QED-sponsored interventional&#xD;
      study, and potentially in additional subjects who are naïve to infigratinib treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment-naïve subjects must have at least a 6-month period of growth assessment in the&#xD;
      PROPEL study (Protocol QBGJ398 001) and will be enrolled in this OLE study only after a dose&#xD;
      to be explored further is identified in Phase 2 Study QBGJ398-201.&#xD;
