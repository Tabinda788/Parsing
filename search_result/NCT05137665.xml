      Brief Summary: The goal of the study is to generate a biorepository of longitudinal blood&#xD;
      (plasma and serum), cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and urine linked to genetics and longitudinal&#xD;
      clinical information that are made available to the research community. To accomplish these&#xD;
      goals, we will enroll 200 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and 80 healthy&#xD;
      controls from multiple sites, over a 5 year time frame. Additionally, speech measures will be&#xD;
      collected on weekly basis at home for all participants. The measurements are performed using&#xD;
      a speech recording application installed on their personal device. For a subset of both ALS&#xD;
      and healthy participants, we will also collect at-home vital capacity on a weekly basis. It&#xD;
      is expected that increased frequency data sampling of these outcome measures will help in&#xD;
      better tracking of disease progression. Biofluids and clinical information are collected over&#xD;
      a 20-month time frame for each individual enrolled in the research study. ALS participants&#xD;
      will be coming to clinic for 5 study visits with a 4-month interval between visits. Healthy&#xD;
      participants will be coming for 2 study visits with a 12-month interval between visits. These&#xD;
      samples and clinical information will be stored in a de-identified manner and made available&#xD;
      for investigators to use in future research studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An industry wide survey performed by Dr. Lyle Ostrow at Johns Hopkins University indicated&#xD;
      that longitudinal bio-fluids linked to detailed clinical information are critical to&#xD;
      continued drug development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with CSF being the top&#xD;
      biofluid often lacking in longitudinal sample biorepositories. There have been prior efforts&#xD;
      for longitudinal collection of biofluids matched to clinical information (see&#xD;
      https://cdmrp.army.mil/alsrp/resources/Biorepositories_biofluids_celllines for a listing of&#xD;
      ALS biorepositories), but those sample sets are limited in size and quickly utilized by the&#xD;
      research community. Based upon input from industry leaders, we propose the creation of a&#xD;
      Target ALS longitudinal biofluids biorepository linked to patient genetic and clinical&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the heterogeneous clinical and biologic nature of ALS, a repository of longitudinal&#xD;
      samples linked to clinical and genetic information is essential to help identify and verify&#xD;
      ALS biomarkers (1, 2). Recent studies to identify ALS biomarkers have used longitudinal&#xD;
      samples from either the sporadic patient population or from those that harbor genetic&#xD;
      mutations known to cause ALS but are not yet symptomatic (3, 4). Beyond exploring the&#xD;
      relationship between known causative genes and candidate biomarkers, the Target ALS&#xD;
      Postmortem Core has collected postmortem ALS tissue samples linked to whole genome sequencing&#xD;
      information that have been valuable at finding new subtypes of ALS linked to transcriptomics&#xD;
      profiles from the tissue samples (5). The current study utilizes medical centers&#xD;
      participating in the Target ALS Postmortem Core to create a longitudinal biofluids repository&#xD;
      from living patients and healthy controls. Given the impact of COVID-19 on ALS clinical&#xD;
      research studies and clinical trials, all participants will participate in at home speech&#xD;
      measures on a weekly basis and we will also enroll 100 ALS and 30 healthy control&#xD;
      participants for at home measures of vital capacity that are completed once every two weeks.&#xD;
      The added feature of these at home measures is to further evaluate the potential for at home&#xD;
      measures in future clinical trials and ability to obtain enriched speech and vital capacity&#xD;
      measures to correlate to downstream biomarker studies using biofluid or genetic data. There&#xD;
      is a growing interest in the use of at home speech analytics to classify and monitor ALS&#xD;
      patients, with recent studies indicating the value for these at home measures in both&#xD;
      clinical research and clinical trial settings (6-8). Our study will not only expand upon&#xD;
      these early findings but also include at home spirometry measures of vital capacity to&#xD;
      evaluate the ability to obtain reliable vital capacity measures at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed study will provide valuable longitudinal biofluids linked to clinical&#xD;
      information, genetic data, at home speech and vital capacity measures for use in future&#xD;
      research studies. These de-identified samples and clinical information will be available to&#xD;
      investigators throughout the world to enhance ALS research and ultimately improved treatments&#xD;
      for ALS. There is a long history of benefit for biorepositories with linked clinical data to&#xD;
      be instrumental in research progress. Most studies that identify biomarkers or validate&#xD;
      biomarkers for human diseases typically require banked samples that are linked to clinical&#xD;
      information to determine sensitivity/specificity of the biomarker for that disease or to&#xD;
      demonstrate change over course of disease.&#xD;

ALS clinic patients with suspected, possible, probable, probable-laboratory supported, or definite ALS will be included. ALS clinic participants with suspected, possible, probable, probable-laboratory supported, and definite Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) according to revised El Escorial Criteria (EEC) will participate in 5 longitudinal visits; Screening/Baseline Visit 1, and four (4) follow-up visits which will occur at approximate 4-month intervals. Upon IRB approved consent, the study participant will undergo the assessments and bio-fluid collections at each visit as outlined in the Schedule of Events.</description>

      Participating sites will label and freeze up to two blood tubes collected from each study&#xD;
      participant for DNA extraction and analysis (up to 12mL) (first visit only). DNA extraction&#xD;
      will be done at Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI). DNA may be stored, used in genome-wide&#xD;
      association studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing, or for any other known&#xD;
      or as yet undiscovered DNA analysis applicable to understanding or targeting disease, with a&#xD;
      particular emphasis on ALS. The whole genomic sequencing will be done at the New York Genome&#xD;
      Center (NYGC). The information from these genetic studies may be made available to&#xD;
      collaborators in academia, not-for-profit settings, or industry for appropriate research.&#xD;

It is expected to take approximately 5 years to complete all sample and data collection for the study. The first phase of the study will involve activating all sites participating in the study, and will take about 4 months to complete. The enrollment period is expected to be about 2-3.5 years. Active assessment for each subject will be for 16-18 months from the time of enrollment. After the end of active assessment period (5 years), the bio-samples and clinical information from the study will be made available for future research.</ipd_description>
