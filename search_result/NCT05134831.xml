  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal obstruction is a possible complication of rhinoplasty surgery. Several causes can&#xD;
      explain it: deviation of the nasal septum, appearance of mucosal flanges inside the nasal&#xD;
      cavity, but also collapse of the internal valve by its fragility. All surgeons performing&#xD;
      rhinoplasty or rhinoseptoplasty are unfortunately confronted with this. Thus, when a&#xD;
      rhinoplasty patient complains of postoperative nasal obstruction, the surgeon routinely&#xD;
      performs several explorations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inspection of the nasal cavity with a nasofibroscope&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of the nasal respiratory flows with a rhinomanometer The results of these 2&#xD;
           explorations allow to determine the cause of the obstruction and if it is explained or&#xD;
           not by a collapse of the internal valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When internal valve collapse is the cause of postoperative nasal obstruction, few&#xD;
      alternatives exist to treat this problem. Revision surgery under general anesthesia is&#xD;
      usually necessary, with placement of a cartilage graft (= spreader graft) in the&#xD;
      septo-triangular angle to reopen and support it. An alternative treatment is the injection of&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid into the septo-triangular angle instead of the cartilage graft placed in the&#xD;
      operating room. This option has several advantages: it is performed during the consultation,&#xD;
      no general anesthesia is required, the procedure is quick, the cost is much lower, the&#xD;
      patient's nasal breathing improves immediately, and the post-procedure follow-up is simple.&#xD;
      The aim of our study is therefore to objectively analyze the modification of nasal&#xD;
      biomechanics after injection of hyaluronic acid in the septo-triangular angle in patients&#xD;
      with internal nasal valve (post (septo)-rhinoplasty). This objective evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed with a rhinomanometer, before and after injection. This is a simple, non-invasive&#xD;
      measuring device that allows the measurement of the main physical variables governing the&#xD;
      biomechanics of the fluids inside the nasal cavity, such as pressure, flow and therefore&#xD;
      nasal resistance. The objective proof of such an efficiency will allow a better management of&#xD;
      the patients, to universalize the practices, to decrease the cost of the treatment and&#xD;
      eventually to bring arguments to the health authorities for the reimbursement of such&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
