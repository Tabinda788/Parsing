    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the barriers to care, evaluation, clinical&#xD;
      practices, and outcomes for patients presenting with sepsis to hospitals in the Kilimanjaro&#xD;
      Region of northern Tanzania. This will include an assessment of timing and selection of&#xD;
      antimicrobials and administration and volume of intravenous fluids. The study also aims to&#xD;
      characterize sepsis sub-types in the epidemiologic context of northern Tanzania using&#xD;
      statistical clustering techniques of clinical variables and of host immune response patterns.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective observational cohort study of adolescent and adult patients with sepsis&#xD;
      presenting to hospitals in the Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania. Participants ≥10 years of age&#xD;
      with suspected infection and the presence of two of the following will be enrolled: (1)&#xD;
      tympanic temperature &gt; 38°C or &lt; 36°C, (2) heart rate &gt; 90 beats/minute, (3) respiratory rate&#xD;
      &gt; 20 breaths/minute. Participants will be observed in the Emergency Department and during&#xD;
      admission. The following data will be collected: demographics and medical history; history of&#xD;
      present illness; laboratory and microbiological workup; antimicrobial selection and timing;&#xD;
      intravenous fluid timing and volume. Vital status will be determined at 7 days, hospital&#xD;
      discharge, and 28 days post-presentation. An enrollment of up to 1250 patients with sepsis is&#xD;
      expected over a two-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to produce additional descriptive data of sepsis epidemiology and&#xD;
      current practice in sSA. The data will yield important insights regarding key care practices&#xD;
      for sepsis, including antimicrobial and intravenous fluid management. Outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with sepsis will be described, including an assessment for correlations between current care&#xD;
      practices and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of potential sepsis sub-types will be undertaken in two domains: 1) clinical&#xD;
      characterization via a robust battery of routine clinical laboratories (chemistry,&#xD;
      hematology, coagulation studies), vital signs, routine clinical signs and anthropometry; 2)&#xD;
      host immune response characterization by analysis of mRNA transcriptome expression in&#xD;
      RNA-stabilized whole blood samples. The goal of the sub-type characterization is to identity&#xD;
      discrete and clinically relevant sepsis phenotypes, and in doing so eventually help optimize&#xD;
      evaluation and management of sepsis specific to the populations and health systems in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa. Detailed etiologic investigations will also take place, including blood&#xD;
      culture, blood parasite smears, and viral respiratory testing of nasopharyngeal samples; for&#xD;
      patients living with HIV, additional evaluations will include serum cryptococcal antigen,&#xD;
      urine lipoarabinomannan assay (TB-LAM) and MycoFLytic blood culture. Collectively, the data&#xD;
      collected in this observational cohort study will contribute to further developing sepsis&#xD;
      management bundles better suited to settings sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
