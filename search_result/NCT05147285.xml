  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of different exercise modalities applied with&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation on functional capacity, oxidative stress and respiratory parameters in&#xD;
      children with cystic fibrosis&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-shortening autosomal recessive disease among&#xD;
      populations of caucasians with a frequency of 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births. The most common&#xD;
      problems in these patients are increased bronchial secretion, decreased exercise capacity,&#xD;
      and shortness of breath. In addition to progressive respiratory disease, peripheral and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle function impairments, inflammation, and contribute to the decrease in&#xD;
      exercise capacity in CF patients. Recent studies show that increased oxidative stress and&#xD;
      impaired oxidant / antioxidant capacity have an important role in disease progression in CF&#xD;
      patients. CF childrens may be more physically inactive. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane&#xD;
      regulator (CFTR) modulators, airway clearance therapies, chest physiotherapy and exercise&#xD;
      trainings are treatment options in these populations. Regular exercise which is the component&#xD;
      of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), is recommended for patients with CF. Aerobic exercise may&#xD;
      help to mobilize secretions, in addition to providing the other known benefits of exercise in&#xD;
      healthy individuals. Despite the benefits of PR programmes, low participant uptake, high&#xD;
      drop-out rates, financial and transportation difficulties reduced the attendance in these&#xD;
      programs. Different telemedicine treatments have been developed to overcome these&#xD;
      difficulties and reduce healthcare costs. In recent studies, shows that tele-exercise is a&#xD;
      promising new approach to promote exercise in children with CF. Although different exercise&#xD;
      modalities such as aerobic exercise training and strength training have been investigated in&#xD;
      CF patients, there is no study to examine stabilization exercises in this populations. Also&#xD;
      there is no study to evaluate the effect of exercise training on irisin. In addition,&#xD;
      although it is known that acute exercise has positive effects on both oxidant and antioxidant&#xD;
      markers in the pediatric population, the effect of long-term exercise on oxidative stress has&#xD;
      not been adequately studied. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of different&#xD;
      exercise training modalities applied with telerehabilitation method on functional capacity,&#xD;
      oxidative stress and respiratory parameters in CF patients. . In the study, after measuring&#xD;
      respiratory functions, exercise capacity, oxidative stress parameters, peripheral muscle&#xD;
      functions, balance, posture, quality of life and physical activity questionnaire, 39 people&#xD;
      will be divided into three groups. First group will be applied only online supervised&#xD;
      stabilization exercises, Second group will be applied online supervised aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training and stabilization exercises. And the third group, the physical activity importance&#xD;
      will be explained and appropriate physical activity recommendations will be made. All outcome&#xD;
      measures will be repeated after exercise training.&#xD;
