  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to learn about how many persons with HAE type I or type II are&#xD;
      attack-free when treated with lanadelumab in real life, how many attacks occur and how many&#xD;
      of these attacks need rescue treatment and about the nature of HAE attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will need to visit their doctor 5 times in total as part of this study. The&#xD;
      visits are planned every 6 months. Participants will also be asked to fill out questionnaires&#xD;
      as part of this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI:GH) at End of Landelumab Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI:GH is a generic questionnaire to measure the effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities during the past seven days. It can be self or interviewer-administered to adults aged 18 years or older. This six-item PRO instrument covers work (five items) and daily activities (one item) using yes/no or numerical answers (number of hours). It takes approximately two to three minutes to complete. WPAI:GH outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages. An overall work productivity score (health or symptom) [%WP], is calculated by multiplying the percentage of work time spent working (health or symptom) [% WTW] by the percentage productivity at work (health or symptom) [%PW]: %WP = %WTW*%PW. High scores indicate prolonged sick leave or impairment and decreased productivity. Change from baseline to the end of lanadelumab therapy in WPAI:GH will be modelled with a linear model using baseline total score and time of therapy as predictors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) at End of Landelumab Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Angioedema quality of life (AE-QoL) questionnaire was a self-administered validated angioedema disease-specific quality of life instrument. It consisted of 17 specific questions that were associated with work, physical activity, free time, social relations, and diet. Each of the 17 items had a 5-point response scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). The questionnaire was scored according to the developers' guidelines to produce a total score and 4 domain scores (functioning, fatigue/mood, fear/shame, nutrition). Raw domain scores (mean of the item scores within each scale) and the raw total score (mean of all item scores) were rescaled using linear transformations into final percentage scores ranging 0 to 100, based on the maximum possible score, where the higher the score the greater the QoL impairment. Change from baseline in AE-QOL at end of landelumab therapy will be analyzed.</description>
