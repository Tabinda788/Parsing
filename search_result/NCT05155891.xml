    <description>The SOC PAE procedure will be performed by attempting to embolize prostatic arteries of both sides in a single session with 300-500 um Embosphere Microspheres. The microspheres will be mixed with a contrast agent and will be delivered to the arteries supplying the prostate via a microcatheter.</description>
