  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures are very common knee injuries amongst youth&#xD;
      involved in sports and are often treated through ACL reconstruction surgeries. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      up to 50% of individuals who undergo ACL reconstruction develop post-traumatic osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (PTOA) in their injured knee by 20 years post-reconstruction causing pain, decreasing&#xD;
      mobility, and impacting quality of life in young active individuals. Much remains unknown&#xD;
      regarding the secondary prevention of PTOA, and more investigation is necessary to better&#xD;
      understand its disease progression post-ACL reconstruction and types of conservative&#xD;
      interventions that can prevent or delay its onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity has improved patient-reported outcomes across many different chronic&#xD;
      diseases including knee osteoarthritis (OA), and physical activity prescription has been&#xD;
      shown to be an effective way to increase patients' levels of physical activity. It has not&#xD;
      yet been heavily investigated in the context of post-ACL reconstruction, and individuals&#xD;
      often exhibit decreased physical activity after ACL reconstruction which causes suboptimal&#xD;
      cartilage health. Thus, physical activity prescription may improve habitual joint loading,&#xD;
      leading to improved cartilage health and patient-reported health outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ACL injuries are extremely common knee injuries sustained by athletes participating in sports&#xD;
      involving sudden changes of direction like jumping, cutting and pivoting. Every year,&#xD;
      approximately 1 in 3500 individuals injure their ACL. ACL reconstruction surgery is a popular&#xD;
      treatment option for young athletes that aims to re-establish knee stability and restore&#xD;
      function, enabling high rates of return to sport. Unfortunately, despite reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery's short-term benefits, it does not significantly alter the course of post-traumatic&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (PTOA) that often develops after sustaining a severe knee injury. In fact,&#xD;
      over half of ACL patients present radiographic signs of OA by 20 years post-reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery. Individuals with OA often have significantly impaired mobility, functionality, and&#xD;
      quality of life, so appropriate rehabilitation protocols and conservative joint management&#xD;
      strategies are necessary to improve knee health outcomes post-reconstruction and keep these&#xD;
      patients healthy and active for as long as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity has widely known preventive and therapeutic effects across many chronic&#xD;
      diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity. Similarly, there is&#xD;
      widespread evidence of high physical activity levels reducing pain and increasing function&#xD;
      and health-related quality of life in individuals with knee and hip osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      indicating its efficacy as a conservative measure for improving joint health. In contrast,&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour increases the risk of OA development and other comorbidities by&#xD;
      increasing body mass index (BMI), causing poorer cartilage health, reducing muscle quality,&#xD;
      and increasing systemic inflammation. Following ACL reconstruction, individuals are&#xD;
      susceptible to adopting more sedentary lifestyles due to a fear of re-injury through&#xD;
      movement, evidenced by relatively lower self-reported physical activity levels compared to&#xD;
      before injury. While ACL injuries may initiate OA pathogenesis, sedentary behaviour is a&#xD;
      modifiable risk factor that can further facilitate disease progression. Since physical&#xD;
      activity prescription effectively increases physical activity levels, it offers potential&#xD;
      utility for improving knee joint health post-reconstruction surgery and preventing or&#xD;
      delaying the onset of PTOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the effects of physical activity prescription on patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
           (KOOS and IKDC scores)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effects of physical activity prescription on femoral trochlear cartilage&#xD;
           thickness and echo intensity based on ultrasound imaging over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the impact of patients' gait biomechanics on changes in patient-reported&#xD;
           outcomes and femoral trochlear cartilage health outcomes due to the physical activity&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Those assigned to the physical activity prescription group will have higher KOOS and&#xD;
           IKDC scores than those in the control group following 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical activity prescription will lead to less reductions in echo intensity and&#xD;
           heterogeneity of the femoral trochlear cartilage over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Poorer femoral trochlear cartilage health imaging outcomes (greater reductions in echo&#xD;
           intensity and heterogeneity) and lower KOOS and IKDC scores at 1 year will be associated&#xD;
           with larger vertical ground reaction forces, smaller knee flexion angles, greater knee&#xD;
           adduction moments, smaller knee extensor moments, and larger vertical loading rates of&#xD;
           the involved limb.&#xD;
