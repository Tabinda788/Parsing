  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized controlled trial. The study is initiated after getting an approval from&#xD;
      ERC FUI. The research is being conducted according to ethical guidelines of Pakistan Medical&#xD;
      Research Council and declaration of Helsinki. Confidentiality and anonymity of participants&#xD;
      is being maintained throughout the research project. Study subjects are being selected on the&#xD;
      basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria and then are being randomly allocated on the basis&#xD;
      of coin toss method in Control and experimental groups. An informed consent is being taken&#xD;
      from study participants prior to recruiting in study. After random allocation the&#xD;
      participants are being given self-administered PAR-Q followed by pre exercise Expiratory&#xD;
      forced vital capacity and VO2 max measurements through Digital spirometer and McArdle Katch&#xD;
      test respectively. Then study participants will be made to perform submaximal exercise&#xD;
      testing according to ACSM guidelines for 03 weeks. The data will be collected at two time&#xD;
      intervals that is on day 1 and then after 03 weeks. Data will then be analyzed using SPSS&#xD;
      version 21.0.&#xD;

      Objectives of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To find out association between aerobic capacity and expiratory forced vital capacity in&#xD;
           overweight obese adults after submaximal exercise training of 03 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find out effectiveness of submaximal exercise training of 03 weeks on aerobic&#xD;
           capacity and expiratory forced vital capacity in overweight obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate hypothesis: There is a significant association between aerobic capacity and&#xD;
      expiratory forced vital capacity in overweight obese adults Null hypothesis: There is no&#xD;
      significant association between aerobic capacity and expiratory forced vital capacity in&#xD;
      overweight obese adults MATERIAL &amp; METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized control trial SETTING: FUIRS clinical lab DURATION OF STUDY: 1.5&#xD;
      years SAMPLE SIZE: N=30 (sample size validated through tool)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLING TECHNIQUE: Non probability convenient sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on Demographics and general information. VO2 max is being assessed&#xD;
      with the help of McArdle Katch test. FVC is being assesed with the help of hand held&#xD;
      spirometer device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group (A) = 03 weeks of submaximal exercise according to ACSM guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (B) =this group is under control with no exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed through SPSS 21 and Data would be analyzed based on the study&#xD;
      design chosen that is random control experimental study within the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent is being taken from study participants prior to recruiting in study.&#xD;
      After random allocation the participants are being given self-administered PAR-Q followed by&#xD;
      pre exercise Expiratory forced vital capacity and VO2 max measurement by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will make people become aware of their current physical fitness level, so the&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors can be modified if needed, in order to improve their quality of life This&#xD;
      study will open new doors for researchers to do long term studies by using different&#xD;
      parametes of lungs function test available in hand held spirometer.&#xD;
