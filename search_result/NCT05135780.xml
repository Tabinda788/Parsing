  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To observe the effect of a multidisciplinary intervention (social accompaniment, school&#xD;
      reinforcement and osteopathic treatment) on the quality of life of children with social risk&#xD;
      in primary school age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe if the quality of life of children in whom an osteopathic intervention is&#xD;
           performed to the family, improves in relation to children who are not treated to the&#xD;
           family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe if the number of sessions has any impact on the evolution of the quality of life&#xD;
           of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe whether age is an influential factor for improving children's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe the possible confounding factors that may influence the evolution of children's&#xD;
           quality of life. These factors are detailed later in the section on secondary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe if there is a decrease in pain, in children who refer it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe if there is an improvement in the different reasons for consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The coordination of the study and its different interventions will be carried out&#xD;
                from the AF. Carrer Consolat de Mar, 45. Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Osteopathic intervention will be performed in AF. It is decided to move the&#xD;
                Solidarity Osteopathy Service to the AF, outside the FOB Osteopathy Clinic, to&#xD;
                bring the solidarity service closer to a more appropriate and closer district for&#xD;
                the patient at social risk. Having to move outside their environment, taking public&#xD;
                transport, language problems and comparative grievances with the utilitarians of a&#xD;
                private service turned out to be reasons for absenteeism and lack of commitment.&#xD;
                The transfer has been a success and we believe it is convenient to carry out the&#xD;
                study within the FA to preserve the location of the project and the comfort/safety&#xD;
                of users at social risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participating families will be referred, as is usually worked in this&#xD;
                foundation, by the Social Services Centers, other agents and social entities, CSMIJ&#xD;

                Ciutadella, Alexandre Galí, Pere Vila), or families who have requested assistance&#xD;
                directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Covid protocol that is in force during the start of the study will be taken&#xD;
                into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The coordination of the study and its different interventions will be carried out&#xD;

Step 1: Transform Score&#xD;
Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows:&#xD;
0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Mean score = Sum of the items over the number of items answered. If 50% or more items are completed: Impute the mean of the completed items in a scale.</description>
