  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The greatest unmet need for people with multiple sclerosis is an effective therapy for the&#xD;
      progressive phase. Current treatments suppress the damage caused by the immune system but&#xD;
      there is only a limited window in which these can work. Consequently, much of the research&#xD;
      community is turning its attention to the process of repair, called remyelination, in which&#xD;
      the lining of nerve cells is reformed. This protects nerves from dying and therefore can&#xD;
      delay, prevent, or even reverse, disability progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has previously been shown that stem cells are already present in the brain that can carry&#xD;
      out this process. Clemastine, an anti-histamine drug, can instruct them to become active and&#xD;
      has already shown a beneficial effect in a phase 2 trial. Now, more recent experiments have&#xD;
      shown that changes take place within these stem cells as they age, which prevents them&#xD;
      responding to drugs like clemastine, but that this can be reversed by treatment with&#xD;
      metformin, a commonly used anti-diabetes drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to establish whether the combination of metformin and clemastine can promote&#xD;
      remyelination in people with MS. We will focus on people with relapsing MS as they will have&#xD;
      a greater proportion of nerves healthy enough to allow remyelination to take place, which&#xD;
      will maximise the chance of detecting an effect with a smaller sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also continue treatment with a current disease-modifying MS treatment, to&#xD;
      reduce the chance of developing new areas of damage, allowing the trial to focus on the&#xD;
      repair process. The treatment duration will be 24 weeks, but given the established safety of&#xD;
      the proposed medications, we are able to limit the number of visits to the trial centre to&#xD;
      ensure participation is not overly burdensome.&#xD;
