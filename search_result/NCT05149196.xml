  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical nephrectomy is a standard operation for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      However, acute kidney injury frequently occur after surgery. And the occurrence of acute&#xD;
      kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Intraoperative&#xD;
      hypotension is identified as an important risk factor of postoperative acute kidney injury.&#xD;
      Preliminary studies showed that goal-directed hemodynamic management may reduce organ injury&#xD;
      after surgery but requires further demonstration. We hypothesized that goal-directed&#xD;
      hemodynamic therapy achieved by combining liquid therapy and vasopressors can reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of acute kidney injury after radical nephrectomy. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of goal-directed hemodynamic management on the incidence of acute&#xD;
      kidney injury in patients following radical nephrectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cancer accounts for 20.3% of urinary system tumors, and the incidence is still&#xD;
      increasing. Surgical resection is the main treatment of renal cancer; radical nephrectomy is&#xD;
      the standard operation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after radical&#xD;
      nephrectomy, with an incidence of up to 53.9%. AKI is associated with the development of&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is an independent risk factor of new onset CKD in patients&#xD;
      without underlying kidney disease. A meta-analysis showed that one year after surgery,&#xD;
      patients with AKI had a 2.7-fold increased risk of new onset or progression of CKD and a&#xD;
      4.8-fold increased risk of end-stage renal disease. Moreover, even mild AKI is associated&#xD;
      with renal insufficiency 1-2 years after surgery. Taking active measures to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of AKI may improve long-term renal function after radical nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many clinical studies show that intraoperative hypotension is an important risk factor of&#xD;
      postoperative kidney injury. For example, a study found that intraoperative mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) &lt;65 mmHg or a decrease of more than 20% from baseline was associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of postoperative AKI; the risk of AKI increased alone with prolonged duration&#xD;
      of hypotension. A recent randomized controlled trial showed that, compared with routine&#xD;
      intraoperative blood pressure management, goal-directed hemodynamic management reduced the&#xD;
      incidence of organ injury from 63.4% to 46.3% within 30 days after surgery. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      included 65 randomized controlled trials with 9308 patients and observed the effect of&#xD;
      goal-directed hemodynamic management on postoperative AKI. The results showed that a&#xD;
      combination of fluid therapy with vasopressors reduced the incidence of AKI in high-risk&#xD;
      patients following major abdominal or orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous pilot trial of the authors, goal-directed hemodynamic management reduced the&#xD;
      incidence of AKI by about 40% in patients following partial nephrectomy. However, the&#xD;
      difference was not statistically significant due to insufficient sample size. The purpose of&#xD;
      this trial is to investigate whether goal-directed intraoperative hemodynamic management can&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing radical nephrectomy.&#xD;
