  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single center, analyst-blinded, study comparing the scratching events identified via an&#xD;
      actigraphy scoring algorithm versus manual scoring of an overnight video recording,&#xD;
      undertaken in a sample of 40 adult patients with atopic dermatitis and controls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Philips scratching algorithm has been cross-validated against the gold-standard&#xD;
      assessment of scratching. The algorithm has been used in many drug development trials,&#xD;
      occasionally as a means of generating secondary endpoints, but most often as a means of&#xD;
      generating exploratory endpoints. The purpose of the proposed study is therefore to validate&#xD;
      the data generated by the scratching study compared to the gold-standard video-assessment of&#xD;
      scratching, in an independent sample of adults with atopic dermatitis and age- and&#xD;
      sex-matched controls&#xD;
