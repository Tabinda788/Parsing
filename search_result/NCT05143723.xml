      Purpose: To determine the efficacy and safety of daily injections of gonadotropin-releasing&#xD;
      hormone agonist in comparison with the standard strategy of supporting the luteal phase in&#xD;
      protocols with gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, in patients at risk of developing&#xD;
      ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and changing the trigger to a gonadotropin-releasing&#xD;
      hormone agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: This prospective, controlled, randomized study, conducted at the&#xD;
      Clinic of the Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education of the&#xD;
      KubSMU of the Ministry of Health of Russia, included 102 patients at risk of developing&#xD;
      ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, who were on protocols with gonadotropin-releasing hormone&#xD;
      antagonists and changing the ovulation trigger to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.&#xD;
      All patients underwent blastocyst transfer on day 5. Patients of the first group (n = 51)&#xD;
      received as support for the luteal phase gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist daily 0.2 mg,&#xD;
      subdermally, patients of the second group (n = 51) progesterone 10 mg 3 times a day, orally&#xD;
      and estradiol 1 mg 3 times a day, transdermal. The level of progesterone on the day of&#xD;
      transfer, the incidence of clinical pregnancy, and the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
      syndrome in both groups were compared.&#xD;

      This prospective randomized study was conducted at the Clinic of the Federal State Budgetary&#xD;
      Educational Institution of Higher Education of the Kuban State Medical University of the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health of Russia from January 2020 till April 2021 and was approved by the&#xD;
      ethical committee of the FSBEI HE KubSMU of the Ministry of Health of Russia Protocol No. 83&#xD;
      dated 07.11.2019. It included 102 patients at risk of developing OHSS, all of whom gave&#xD;
      written informed voluntary consent. Inclusion criteria were: age - from 20 to 40; AMH - more&#xD;
      than 2.5 ng/ml; the number of antral follicles (AFC) - more than 15 (menstrual cycle days&#xD;
      1-5); stimulation of ovarian function in the protocol with GnRH-antagonist in IVF/ICSI&#xD;
      cycles, with the change of the ovulation trigger to GnRH-a; tubal, unspecified and&#xD;
      anovulatory infertility; body mass index (BMI) from 18 to 29 (inclusive); 15 or more&#xD;
      follicles per day of ovulation trigger injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: presence of external genital endometriosis; male factor of infertility;&#xD;
      hydrosalpinx and/or tubo-ovarian formation (on one or both sides) according to&#xD;
      hysterosalpingography and/or ultrasound investigation; malformations of internal genital&#xD;
      organs, including conditions after surgical correction of malformations of internal genital&#xD;
      organs; acquired deformities of the uterine cavity, in which embryo implantation or pregnancy&#xD;
      is impossible; contraindications to the IVF/ICSI program; severe systemic diseases; cycles&#xD;
      with cryopreserved sperm or oocytes; oocyte donation. The patients were divided into two&#xD;
      groups using the envelope method. On days 2-5 of the menstrual cycle, a study of the level of&#xD;
      blood hormones was carried out: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH),&#xD;
      progesterone, and estradiol, as well as transvaginal ultrasonography of the pelvic organs to&#xD;
      determine the number of antral follicles (AFC) and exclusion of contraindications for the&#xD;
      start of COS. Then СOS was carried out using gonadotropins, menotropins. The standard daily&#xD;
      starting dose of stimulant drugs was determined according to age, BMI, original FSH, AFC, and&#xD;
      ovarian response in women undergoing previous IVF/ICSI cycles. The ovarian response was&#xD;
      assessed using folliculometry, starting from 5-6 days of COS, when two follicles with an&#xD;
      average diameter of more than 14 mm or one more than 16 mm were reached, GnRH-ant was&#xD;
      prescribed at a dose of 0.25 mg daily. Ovulation trigger (GnRH-a) was introduced on condition&#xD;
      that two or more follicles with a diameter of 17-18 mm were reached; after 36 hours,&#xD;
      transvaginal ovarian puncture (TVOP) was performed under ultrasound control. All mature eggs&#xD;
      (ova) were fertilized using IVF or ICSI methods. Fertilization was assessed after about 20&#xD;
      hours, and the embryos were transferred into the uterine cavity on day 3 or 5. LPS in all&#xD;
      patients started the day after oocyte retrieval and continued until 8 weeks of gestation in&#xD;
      case of positive result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of the first group (n=51) received GNRH-a for LPS at a dose of 0.2 mg, subdermally,&#xD;
      daily from the second day after TVOP. The second group of patients (n=51) received&#xD;
      progesterone as LPS at a dosage of 30 mg per day, per os, and estradiol at a dosage of 3 mg&#xD;
      per day, transdermally starting from the second day after TVOP till 8 weeks of pregnancy. The&#xD;
      embryo transfer was carried out 3-5 days after TVOP, one or two embryos were transferred,&#xD;
      depending on the morphological assessment of the embryo. On the day of transfer, a study of&#xD;
      the level of progesterone in the peripheral blood was carried out. Pregnancy testing was&#xD;
      performed by determining the level of β-hCG in the peripheral blood 14 days after the embryo&#xD;
      transfer. Data were collected on participant characteristics, COS, and embryology.&#xD;
      Characteristics included: patient's age, characteristics of ovarian reserve (AMH, FSH), type,&#xD;
      duration and cause of infertility, duration of COS, the total dose of gonadotropin treatment,&#xD;
      endometrial thickness on the day of ovulation trigger administration, number of oocytes and&#xD;
      embryos retrieved. The outcomes were positive dynamics of β-hCG growth and clinical&#xD;
      indicators of pregnancy. Clinical pregnancy was defined as an ongoing pregnancy with&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging of the ovum and fetal heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of data was carried out using STATISCA 10 package (Tibco, USA).&#xD;
      Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's Chi-square test,&#xD;
      Maximum likelihood Chi-square tests were used. p &lt;0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
