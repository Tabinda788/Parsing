    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study trial to determine whether hyperacute (≤8 hour) mechanical&#xD;
      Minimal Invasive Surgical (MIS) management is feasible and secondarily improves outcome in&#xD;
      patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be enrolled and randomized to&#xD;
      either minimally invasive hematoma evacuation (MIS) or best medical management alone (MM).&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned by a central web-based system in a 3:1 manner to treatment&#xD;
      with MIS or MM. Data for each subject will be collected at the time of enrollment and&#xD;
      treatment, and at subsequent follow-up visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to determine whether hyperacute (≤8 hour) mechanical MIS management&#xD;
      is feasible and improves outcome in patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracranial&#xD;
      hemorrhage (ICH).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening The subject will be evaluated as any non-traumatic spontaneous&#xD;
           intra-parenchymal hemorrhage patient including medical history screened, available&#xD;
           clinical/neurological exams (focused exam, NIHSS, GCS, historical mRS), ECG, laboratory&#xD;
           work, and imaging information per institutional standard of care. A CTA (or MRA) will be&#xD;
           performed, as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization After all inclusion and exclusion criteria are confirmed and written&#xD;
           informed consent obtained, randomization will occur. Subjects will be randomized to best&#xD;
           MM or MIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Procedure (if randomized to MIS) Minimally Invasive Surgical evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Procedure (if randomized to MM) There is no intervention for the control group&#xD;
           beyond the current standard of care provided at The Ottawa Hospital. Subjects randomized&#xD;
           to the MM group will receive best MM for ICH according to Canadian Best Practice&#xD;
           Recommendations for ICH care. Outcomes assessments will be in accordance to table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post procedure, D1, D2 and D5 or discharging A post-procedural computed tomographic scan&#xD;
           will be obtained within 24 hours (± 6 hours) for MIS group. Clinical assessment such as&#xD;
           NIHSS, mRS, NCCT head, computed tomographic Angiogram, adverse event assessment will be&#xD;
           conducted as SOC for MIS group (Table 2 in protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CT will be obtained in MM subjects 24 hours (± 6 hours) after randomization. Adverse event&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted for MM subjects 4-6 hours after randomization. Neurological and&#xD;
      functional exams will be conducted in D1 and D2 after randomization (Table 2 in protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits (D30, D90): (Both MIS and MM groups) Follow-ups will be combined with phone&#xD;
      and onsite visit. D30 will be conducted over the phone, and D90 will be onsite visit. The&#xD;
      follow-ups will involve clinical assessment such as NIHSS, Glasgow Coma Scale, EuroQol- 5&#xD;
      Dimension (EQ-5D), mRS, Barthel, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE), adverse event assessment,&#xD;
      concomitant. medications.&#xD;

The EQ-5D-5L comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels:&#xD;
