  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot study investigated the bioavailability in adult human subjects of 1 tablet&#xD;
      formulations containing Diosmin/Hesperidin (90/10) 500 mg. The Pilot study was performed at a&#xD;
      single site with 12 subjects. Participants took 1 tablets of the test product and reference&#xD;
      product in 2 periods and 2 sequences (either test after reference or reference after test).&#xD;
      There was a washout of 7 days between each study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diosmin/Hesperidin (90/10) of 1 tablet formulations with Diosmin/Hesperidin (90/10) 500 mg to&#xD;
      demonstrate bioequivalence of both formulations in terms of rate and extent of absorption:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andr√≥maco S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference Product: Daflon [Trademark], product of Les Laboratoires Servier, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 90% confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus&#xD;
      Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to infinite&#xD;
      (AUC0-inf), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total metabolite Diosmetin and&#xD;
      Hesperetin was determined. Participants were confined in the study site for approximately 42&#xD;
      hours during each study period (for 10 hours pre-dosing and for 32 hours post dosing) during&#xD;
      which pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples were obtained. 21 blood samples were taken up to 32&#xD;
      hours after the administration in each period. Participants returned to the site to provide&#xD;
      additional blood samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose. The washout period between the two study&#xD;
      periods was 7days. The samples from each participant were analyzed with validated LC-MS/MS&#xD;
      method used for estimation of Diosmetin and Hesperetin in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety objective was to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in subjects by&#xD;
      collecting adverse events.&#xD;
