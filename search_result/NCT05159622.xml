  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the preliminary effects of an intervention to reduce sugary drinks among&#xD;
      low-income parents (n=38)(primary caregivers) and their young children (6 months-3 year olds)&#xD;
      compared to a control group (n=38). The main outcome is behavioral: sugary drink consumption&#xD;
      (self-reported servings/day) among parents and among their children (parent-reported&#xD;
      servings/day). These outcomes are measured at baseline and immediately after the 12-week&#xD;
      intervention. An exploratory aim will test if the intervention has a sustained behavioral&#xD;
      effect and an effect on body mass index and waist circumference of the parents 12 months&#xD;
      after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our mixed methods multi-phase approach includes a quantitative component (randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial - Aim 1) and a qualitative component (in-depth interviews and focus groups-&#xD;
      Aim 2) to test the effects of a behavioral intervention to replace sugary drinks with water&#xD;
      at home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is a risk factor for obesity, diabetes, and&#xD;
      other chronic diseases. Consumption of SSB begins at an early age and may have cumulative&#xD;
      detrimental consequences to health later in life. There is an urgent need to facilitate&#xD;
      reduction of SSB consumption among young children before this behavior becomes part of an&#xD;
      unhealthy lifestyle. The public health recommendation to drink water instead of SSB does not&#xD;
      consider the multiple barriers that underserved communities face when choosing a beverage in&#xD;
      an environment with limited access to clean, palatable drinking water, and saturated with SSB&#xD;
      promotion. Using a community participatory approach, the investigators developed an&#xD;
      intervention, Water Up! at Home, which draws on theory and community experience to position&#xD;
      parents as social models for their young children. The objective of the current proposal is&#xD;
      to test the preliminary effects of this intervention to replace SSB with filtered tap water&#xD;
      among low-income parents and their children (6 months-3 year olds). The working hypothesis is&#xD;
      that by addressing sociocultural (via curriculum) and physical (via water filter) barriers,&#xD;
      parents can reduce their own and their children's SSB consumption. The investigators will use&#xD;
      a multiphase sequential mixed-methods design to integrate qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      findings. Aim 1) Partnering with an existing home visiting program of Early Head Start, the&#xD;
      EHS staff will deliver the intervention to replace SSB with filtered tap water at home and&#xD;
      test its effects using a randomized control trial. H1) Parents randomly assigned to the Water&#xD;
      Up! at Home program (n=38) will see a net reduction of 0.5 servings/day of SSB compared with&#xD;
      the control group at the end of the intervention (12 weeks). H2) Findings will show a similar&#xD;
      reduction in SSB consumption among young children. Exploratory aim: 12 months after baseline,&#xD;
      the investigators will explore changes on body mass index and waist circumference of parents.&#xD;
      To assess the quality of program implementation, the investigators will use a summative&#xD;
      process evaluation. Aim 2) To assess the psychosocial mediators of intervention effects and&#xD;
      to understand why the program was or was not successful, the investigators will conduct 30&#xD;
      in-depth interviews with parents, segmented by whether they responded positively/negatively&#xD;
      to the intervention. The investigators will also conduct two focus groups with Early Head&#xD;
      Start staff (n=10) to describe the aspects of the intervention design, context,&#xD;
      implementation and delivery that may affect program impact, its sustainability and&#xD;
      practicability. The study addresses a novel paradigm that posits water security at home as a&#xD;
      determinant of SSB consumption among low-income parents and their children.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Effect Evaluation: Using a pre- and post-evaluation design, the investigators will evaluate the effects of randomized controlled trial by comparing self-reported SSB intake (servings/day) among participants in the intervention vs. control groups. Data collection points are: baseline, follow-up (12-weeks after the start of the intervention), and a second follow-up (12 months after the start of the intervention) to explore the sustainability of behaviors and potential effect on anthropometric measures. The entire survey (lasting about 40 minutes) will be administered at home.&#xD;
Primary Outcome (SSB intake) During the three data collection periods, the investigators will use the Beverage Intake Questionnaire a quantitative food frequency questionnaire that assesses habitual beverage consumption of 15 beverage categories in the past month.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Description of behavioral intervention Water Up! at Home: The intervention is theory-based and was designed to be sensitive to the context, perceptions and needs of this high risk population. It was collaboratively developed with key stakeholders in the predominantly Latino immigrant community. The curriculum consists of 12 infographics and lessons (bilingual Spanish/English) designed to increase knowledge of drinking water health benefits, safety/cleanliness, cost/convenience, prior experience. The 12-week intervention will be delivered in participants' home by the home visitor. Participants will receive a water filter for use in their home in addition to educational information about water and sugary beverages. Throughout the lessons, they will be asked to complete various activities such as taking pictures and engaging in discussions about their water drinking habits.</description>

    <description>1: Addressing physical barriers to replace SSB with water at home: Participants will receive a personal, reusable bottle of water, a National Sanitation Foundation-certified water filter pitcher and one additional filter cartridge 2: Addressing sociocultural barriers to change individual perceptions: The curriculum has 6 topics delivered in 12 sessions: a) water for your health (diabetes/obesity among Latinos); b) health benefits of water vs. SSB, c) sugar content of SSB, d) safety &amp; affordability of filtered tap water vs. bottled beverages, e) access and promotion of SSB vs. water in your community, f) tips for improving water taste, perceived susceptibility, severity, costs and benefits. 3: Addressing sociocultural barriers to increase skills: During each session, participants will be asked to perform hands-on learning activities (e.g., measure sugar content in SSB, take pictures of themselves explaining to their family members the key messages of various lessons).</description>
