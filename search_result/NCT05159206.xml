  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate a new technique that optimizes the prosthesis position&#xD;
      for patients who undergo total hip arthroplasty surgery. Today, most surgeons take a regular&#xD;
      X-ray (2D) to plan the surgery. In this study, patients will do a computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      before surgery, and with the use of the new system, the investigators will be able to make a&#xD;
      more accurate plan when it comes to prosthetic placement and leg length adjustment in 3D. The&#xD;
      software uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate the information required for clinical&#xD;
      conclusions automatically, and it enables surgeons to adapt to each unique case and&#xD;
      anticipate situations during surgery. The system also helps the surgeon during operation with&#xD;
      a navigation tool to place the implant in the pre-operatively planned position. It guides&#xD;
      surgeons in real-time to place the implants accurately. To see whether the plan and&#xD;
      navigation were correct, the investigators will do a new computed tomography after surgery to&#xD;
      look at the achieved result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to planning and navigation, the same system can be used measure the migration of&#xD;
      the prosthesis in relation to the bone over time using AI by comparing multiple scans. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to follow all patients for 2 years (total of 4 CT scans after surgery) with&#xD;
      the intention to be able to foresee implant loosening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate a new system for CT-based 3D planning, navigation and&#xD;
      subsequent postoperative migration analysis in patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA).&#xD;
      Patients (age 40-75 years) with osteoarthritis, eligible for surgery, are asked to&#xD;
      participate, and the investigators plan to follow all patients for 2 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In THA surgery, the goal is to recreate the natural motion-center of the hip, adjust for&#xD;
      possible leg length differences and to optimize prosthetic placement to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      future dislocation or loosening. Today, usually a plain X-ray is taken before the operation&#xD;
      to plan size and position. This has its limitations since the operator can not assess the 3D&#xD;
      position on a 2D image. In this study, the investigators are using a new system for planning&#xD;
      in 3D, based on a low-dose CT scan and with the help of AI. Moreover, the surgeon get&#xD;
      real-time information of the prosthetic position during surgery (called navigation), after&#xD;
      matching the physical patient to a virtual patient. The hypothesis is that prosthetic&#xD;
      placement and patient satisfaction will improve with 3D planning and navigation, resulting in&#xD;
      a more anatomical restoration, and that postoperative complications, such as dislocation and&#xD;
      ultimately loosening will reduce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entering this study entails taking a CT scan before surgery (instead of a plain X-ray), and&#xD;
      for validation, a postoperative CT scan. This enables the investigators to find out whether&#xD;
      the planning and navigation are confirmed by the postoperative position. In addition to&#xD;
      planning and navigation, the investigators wish to implement a way of measuring prosthetic&#xD;
      migration after surgery. Today, this is done by implanting small metal (tantalum) markers in&#xD;
      the bone during surgery, and then measuring the distance between prosthesis and markers over&#xD;
      time in a special software on multiple X-rays (This method is called RSA, Radiostereometric&#xD;
      Analysis). However, few hospitals have the expertise or equipment to do these analyses and it&#xD;
      is a somewhat laborious process. This study will to evaluate a new tool for making equivalent&#xD;
      migration analysis, based on CT scans. By matching the postoperative CT image to subsequent&#xD;
      CT scans at 3 months, 1 and 2 years after surgery the investigators can see how much the&#xD;
      prosthesis has moved in relation to the bone and hopefully being able to foresee future&#xD;
      loosening. The hypotheses is that CT migration analysis will be as accurate and precise as&#xD;
      the current gold standard (RSA). A subset of the patients will have RSA performed as well for&#xD;
      direct comparison between the systems regarding migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transition from plain X-ray images to low-dose CT will result in a marginal increase in the&#xD;
      radiation dose. At the same time, it means that a much more accurate imaging of the skeleton&#xD;
      is performed, and thus improved preoperative planning and a peroperative navigation can be&#xD;
      done with much more predictable results. This study has been approved by the Swedish Ethical&#xD;
      Review Authority, as well as the local radiation committee. The company, Ortoma, supplying&#xD;
      the measurement system for planning and navigation (Ortoma Treatment Solution (OTSâ„¢)) has&#xD;
      received ISO13485 certification and CE-certificate on all parts.&#xD;

    <description>To validate the Ortoma treatment solution software, we will compare the preoperative CT plan (planned prosthesis size and position) to the actual achieved postoperative implant size and position as measured on postoperative CT. We also compare the peroperatively measured values during surgical navigation to the measured values on postoperative CT. We will measure translational (mm) and rotational (degrees) differences between planned, peroperative and achieved implant position, as well as offset and leg length differences (mm).</description>
