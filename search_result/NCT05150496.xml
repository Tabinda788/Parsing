    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, and positive-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial of&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac®) manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity of using the high (1200SU) or medium&#xD;
      (600SU) dose of CoronaVac® as the booster dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, and positive-controlled phaseⅡb clinical trial of 640&#xD;
      participants aged 18 years and above, who have completed 2 doses of inactivated COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine (CoronaVac®) or mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) as the primary vaccination.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned into two arms at a ratio of 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive a booster dose of medium-dose (600SU) or high-dose (1200SU) COVID-19 Vaccine. For&#xD;
      those who were vaccinated with CoronaVac®, the booster dose will be given 3-8 months after&#xD;
      their second dose. For those who were vaccinated with Comirnaty, the booster dose will be&#xD;
      given 6-8 months after their second dose. Each participant will be collected 5.0 ml blood&#xD;
      sample before vaccination and 14 days,3 months and 6 months after booster&#xD;
      immunization.Immunogenicity assessments will be determined by neutralizing antibodies in all&#xD;
      participants.In addition,all participants will be monitored for immediate reactions (within&#xD;
      30 minutes) after the booster dose vaccination, adverse events of special interest (AESIs)&#xD;
      and serious adverse events (SAEs) for 12 months after booster dose inoculation. In addition,&#xD;
      all participants in will be monitored for local and systemic solicited adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      within 7 days and the unsolicited AEs within 28 days.&#xD;
