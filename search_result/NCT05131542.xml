  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotonia is a common trait in infants with Down syndrome, resulting in pathologies and&#xD;
      delays in gaining basic motor skills. There are no screenings available to aid in early&#xD;
      diagnosis, therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a way to test for hypotonia in&#xD;
      children with Down syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypotonia is usually diagnosed by observation and clinical assessment. Aiming to develop an&#xD;
      instrument for early diagnosis, a systematic review was carried out which compiled&#xD;
      characteristics and testing that are attributed to or used in the diagnosis of hypotonia.&#xD;
      They were presented as an item group and a first stage was created and administered to 50&#xD;
      children with Down's Syndrome between the ages of 7 months to 8 years old. The study of the&#xD;
      results showed which characteristics were really related to the convention and which were&#xD;
      more affected by changing factors. Then a final scale was developed that met the expected&#xD;
      requirements of validity and reliability.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality assessment of items by homogeneity analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS-21 program.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>A study of homogeneity of the items was carried out to know if each item was measuring the same as the globality of the test. It was carried out by means of a reliability study of the statistics of each item compared to the total scale.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>It was done through expert judgment. It was reviewed by three physiotherapists with extensive experience in treating hypotonic children and those items directed to the orofacial complex were also agreed with an expert speech therapist.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation between the graduation of hypotonia derived from the scale and the observational diagnosis estimated by the evaluator was analyzed. An ANOVA test was used to compare both diagnostic assessments.extensive experience in treating hypotonic children and those items directed to the orofacial complex were also agreed with an expert speech therapist.</description>
