  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label, 8-cohort parallel group study to&#xD;
      assess changes in select biomarkers of exposure (BoE) and biomarkers of potential harm (BoPH)&#xD;
      in generally healthy smokers switching to the study investigational products (IPs), compared&#xD;
      to subjects who continue to smoke, undergo smoking abstinence, or have never smoked.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will participate in a baseline biomarker assessment and smokers will then be&#xD;
      switched to exclusive use of their assigned product (cohorts 1-5), continue to smoke (cohort&#xD;
      6), or smoking cessation (cohort 7), and never-smokers will continue to not smoke (cohort 8).&#xD;
      Subjects will be directed to use their assigned product exclusively for 6 months and will&#xD;
      participate in study visits throughout the study for safety, product re-supply and collection&#xD;
      of samples for biomarker assessments. Throughout the study, subjects will report their daily&#xD;
      use of the study IP and/or cigarette smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be ambulatory, with subjects in cohorts 1-7 attending a total of 7 clinic&#xD;
      visits (one every approximately 30 days) over a period of 6 months. Subjects in cohorts 1-7&#xD;
      will be confined in the study site overnight the night before their Day 1 (Visit 1,&#xD;
      baseline), Day 90 (Visit 4) and Day 180 (Visit 7) visits. The Day 30 (Visit 2), Day 60 (Visit&#xD;
      3), Day 120 (Visit 5) and Day 150 (Visit 6) visits will be non-residential visits for&#xD;
      pregnancy testing (female subjects) and product usage assessments and resupply only. Subjects&#xD;
      in cohort 8 will attend the clinic for Visit 1, Visit 4 and Visit 7 only, and will be&#xD;
      confined in the clinic overnight the night before each of these visits. In addition, all&#xD;
      subjects will attend a Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers will be asked to continue smoking their usual brand (UB) cigarettes until&#xD;
      randomization (cohorts 1-6) or enrollment (cohort 7) at Visit 1. Never-smokers will be asked&#xD;
      to continue not to use any tobacco or nicotine products for the entire study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be confined on Visit 1 and will use their UB cigarettes ad libitum during&#xD;
      this period (unless required to abstain for specific tests and excluding cohort 8, who will&#xD;
      not use any nicotine or tobacco products). Exhaled breath, 24-hour urine and blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected and evaluated for baseline BoE and BoPH. Smokers of non-menthol UB&#xD;
      cigarettes will then be randomized to cohort 1, 5 or 6; smokers of mentholated UB cigarettes&#xD;
      will be randomized to cohort 2, 3, 4 or 6; smokers who intend to quit smoking will be&#xD;
      enrolled to cohort 7; and never-smokers will be enrolled to cohort 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be confined on Visit 4 and Visit 7. Subjects in cohorts 1-6 will use their&#xD;
      assigned product exclusively, ad libitum during this period (unless required to abstain for&#xD;
      specific tests). Other than subjects in cohort 7 who are using nicotine replacement therapy&#xD;
      as part of their smoking cessation strategy, subjects in cohorts 7 and 8 will not use any&#xD;
      tobacco or nicotine products. Exhaled breath, 24-hour urine and blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected and evaluated for BoE and BoPH.&#xD;
