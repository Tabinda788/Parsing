  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a challenging procedure itself, being even more complex and&#xD;
      demanding in emergency settings. Only a few cases of emergency pancreaticoduodenectomy (EPD)&#xD;
      are reported in medical literature, usually performed for complex pancreaticoduodenal&#xD;
      lesions. EPD has first been mentioned in trauma settings, even fewer cases being reported for&#xD;
      non-traumatic indications. The investigators intend to present our experience with this&#xD;
      intervention, in a non-trauma surgical centre. Our study is a prospective consecutive case&#xD;
      series, that included patients that underwent emergency pancreaticoduodenectomy from January&#xD;
      2014 to May 2021. Data was collected from the electronic system database. The investigators&#xD;
      collected data regarding the demographic characteristics of the patients, their medical&#xD;
      history, preoperative and postoperative investigations (including blood work and imagistic&#xD;
      investigations), surgery related information and postoperative evolution.&#xD;

    <description>Emergency pancreaticoduodenectomy (EPD) is a complex surgical procedure, that can be performed for complex pancreaticoduodenal injuries, that cannot be controlled through less invasive procedures. EPD can be performed either as a classical Whipple procedure, or as a pylorus-preserving procedure. A one stage procedure implies the reconstruction step being done in the same surgical intervention, while a two step procedure implies the reconstruction being done in a later stage, through a second surgical intervention.</description>
