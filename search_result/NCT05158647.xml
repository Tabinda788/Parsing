  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional block of ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric (IIIH) nerves has been applied to provide&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia after inguinal hernia repair. Magnesium sulfate (MgSo4) blocks&#xD;
      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and that is why, it was used as an adjuvant to the local&#xD;
      anesthetic (LA) in different anesthetic approaches. Although the prolongation in&#xD;
      postoperative duration resulting from the addition of MgSO4 to LA was significant in some&#xD;
      literature studies, it was insignificant in others. This study was designed to investigate&#xD;
      the adjunctive effect of MgSo4 when added to bupivacaine for IIIH blockade on the&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic duration as a primary outcome and on the verbal rating scale (VRS)&#xD;
      scores, analgesic consumption, and hemodynamics as secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      postoperative analgesic duration as a primary outcome and on the verbal rating scale (VRS)&#xD;
      scores, analgesic consumption, and hemodynamics as secondary outcomes. Patients were divided&#xD;
      into two groups of 45 patients each by means of coded envelopes according to the LA used for&#xD;
      IIIH blockade. In the first group (control group), patients received 10 ml 0.5% isobaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine plus 1 ml normal saline for IIIH blockade, whereas in the second group (MgSo4&#xD;
      group), 10 ml 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine and 1 ml of MgSo4 10% were prepared. All the patients&#xD;
      received intrathecal 3 ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, and then, IIIH blockade was performed&#xD;
      under ultrasound guidance according to the group. Postoperatively, VRS scores,analgesic&#xD;
      duration, and any complication were recorded.&#xD;
