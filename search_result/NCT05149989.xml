  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, intensive care units (ICUs) across the country have been&#xD;
      inundated with increasing numbers of COVID patients. Hypoxic patients in ICU require&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and this can be improved by proning these patients to improve&#xD;
      oxygenation and prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. Standard practice is to use standard&#xD;
      hospital pillows to support the pelvis and chest of the patient while they are proned. These&#xD;
      pillows do not provide much support to the patients and often need to be adjusted due to the&#xD;
      patient 'sinking' into them. Prolonged pronation also leads to pressure sores in these&#xD;
      anatomical locations which burden the Trust financially and also cause distress to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new proning pillow system was developed by Dr Sashika Selladurai and manufactured for the&#xD;
      ICU in Aintree hospital which is made from polyurethane memory foam designed to relieve&#xD;
      pressure on the patients and prevent pressure sores that often occur during prolonged&#xD;
      proning. The pillow system is also designed to withstand the load of heavier patients and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of 'sinking' into the pillows when proned for long periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the performance of the new proning pillow system with&#xD;
      standard pillows, particularly in relation to the risk of pressure sores, by evaluating&#xD;
      differences in chest and pelvis interface pressures between the two pillow types. This will&#xD;
      be done by having healthy NHS staff lie on the pillows in the prone position for a short&#xD;
      period of time while recording the pressure distribution on the pillows using pressure mats&#xD;
      placed between them and the pillows. This will help understand the relative risk of pressure&#xD;
      sores developing when the new pillow system is used. It is hypothesised that the new pillow&#xD;
      system does not increase the risk of pressure sores developing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new proning pillow system is a Class 1 CE marked medical device. The proning pillow&#xD;
      system consists of a chest pillow and a pelvis pillow made from memory foam designed to&#xD;
      reduce contact pressures and peak interface pressures in patients and allow patients to be&#xD;
      placed in neutral position for ventilation.&#xD;
