      This study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to analyze whether more changes in melanocytic nevi (MN) occur in women during and after&#xD;
           pregnancy compared to non-pregnant women of the same age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and to analyze psychological effects of total body mapping and dermoscopic examination&#xD;
           assisted by artificial intelligence during pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melanocytic nevi (MN) are believed to undergo macroscopic and dermoscopic alterations during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Possible changing features previously observed include color, pigment network,&#xD;
      size, vascularization and the emerging of dots and globules. Recent studies have reported of&#xD;
      melanoma being associated with increased mortality in pregnant women when compared to&#xD;
      non-pregnant women. The new FotoFinder® ATBM master device provides the combination of total&#xD;
      body mapping with deep learning-driven body scan algorithm which identifies all pigmented&#xD;
      skin lesions of the body surface by pattern recognition software and supplies a risk&#xD;
      assessment score (0.0-1.0; 0 indicating no suspicion for melanoma, 1 indicating a high&#xD;
      suspicion for melanoma).&#xD;

    <description>At baseline, the participants will complete a questionnaire concerning their previous exposure to sun, their current sun-related protective behaviours, their history of skin check frequency and skin cancer at baseline. Additionally, in each consultation newly-created study-specific questions concerning the participants' examination experience, the sun-related protective behaviours and worries about skin cancer throughout the study will be investigated.</description>
