      Dental treatment under GA provides a safe approach and has significant positive effects on&#xD;
      quality of life for children with down syndrome who cannot accept normal treatment. Oral&#xD;
      health related quality of life is measured in relation to how the mouth and teeth affect&#xD;
      physical, psychological and social well-being and daily activities such as eating, chewing,&#xD;
      swallowing, speaking, playing, learning, happiness, embarrassment, and social interactions&#xD;
      (Jabarifar et al., 2009). Jankauskiene et al., 2010 conducted a systematic review concluded&#xD;
      that &quot;Oral rehabilitation under GA results in immediate improvement of the children's oral&#xD;
      health and physical, emotional and social quality of life. It also has a positive impact on&#xD;
      the family&quot;. Dental caries is a common condition amongst young children which negatively&#xD;
      impacts on their quality of life. children with down syndrome who have an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing caries due to various reasons: limited oral healthcare, difficultty in dental&#xD;
      services,un stable diet, the high sugar contents in their medications and low salivary&#xD;
      secretion(Peerbhay &amp; Titinchi, 2014).&#xD;
