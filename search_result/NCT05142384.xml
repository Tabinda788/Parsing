  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low income women of childbearing age are at increased risk for depression and often do not&#xD;
      receive needed treatment. Investigators developed Mom-Net, an on-line cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      treatment (CBT) for depression to address the needs of low income women of childbearing age.&#xD;
      The intervention program also includes live coaching to help the mothers engage and learn the&#xD;
      CBT material. Mom-Net has been shown to be highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms&#xD;
      and improving parenting behavior and child adjustment, in earlier controlled trials. In this&#xD;
      project the investigators are examining whether access to Mom-Net can be expanded by&#xD;
      delivering it in Head Starts (HS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address that broad question, the investigators will focus on two sets of scientific&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implementation Questions: e.g., Can HS agencies deliver the program successfully; do HSs&#xD;
           choose to sustain the program after the research project ends; what agency&#xD;
           characteristics are associated with successful delivery of Mom-Net);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effectiveness Questions: e.g., Does Mom-Net reduce maternal depression when delivered by&#xD;
           Head Start agencies, with HS staff doing the coaching?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head Start agencies will be randomized to deliver either Mom-Net with the usual&#xD;
      high-intensity coaching or with a low-intensity coaching alternative. Within each agency,&#xD;
      depressed mothers will be randomized to receive either: 1) Mom-Net program; or 2) Treatment&#xD;
      as Usual (TAU;) referral to community mental health providers). Mothers initially assigned to&#xD;
      the TAU condition, will have the option of receiving Mom-Net at a later date. Mothers will&#xD;
      participate in assessments of depressive symptoms, parenting behavior, and child adjustment&#xD;
      at Time 1 (T1; prior to randomization); and Time 2 (T2; after the intervention period) and&#xD;
      Time 3 (T3; one year after T1).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low income women of childbearing age are at disproportionate risk for depressive syndromes&#xD;
      and, despite the availability of efficacious interventions, often do not receive needed&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators developed Mom-Net, a remote, coach-facilitated, Internet-based&#xD;
      intervention adapted from an empirically-supported cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for&#xD;
      depression to address the needs of depressed mothers. Two randomized control trials&#xD;
      demonstrated Mom-Net to be highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving&#xD;
      parenting behavior and child adjustment. In this project investigators seek to examine&#xD;
      whether the reach of the Mom-Net intervention can be expanded by implementing within the Head&#xD;
      Start Environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are using a hybrid type 2, Effectiveness-Implementation design to compare two&#xD;
      implementation approaches for the delivery of Mom-Net, one with its existing high-intensity&#xD;
      coaching approach, and one making use of a low-intensity coaching, designed to provide&#xD;
      supportive accountability, but not psychoeducational support. Investigators will follow the&#xD;
      Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment process model (EPIS) to guide the&#xD;
      evaluation, with the Clinical Trial component primarily constituting the Implementation&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Trial Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine effectiveness and Implementation outcomes of Mom-Net within Head-Start,&#xD;
           randomizing agencies to implementation approach (i.e., high- vs low-intensity coaching)&#xD;
           and mothers within agency, to either Mom-Net or Treatment as Usual (TAU)/waitlist&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Compare the two Mom-Net implementation approaches on: 1) implementation outcomes&#xD;
                including reach, acceptability, fidelity, and cost; and 2) effectiveness outcomes&#xD;
                including self-reported maternal depressive symptoms (primary outcome), parenting&#xD;
                behavior, and child emotional and behavioral functioning (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Examine the effectiveness of each Mom-Net implementation approach relative to TAU&#xD;
                on the primary and secondary outcomes listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consistent with an experimental therapeutic approach, investigators will examine the&#xD;
           mediating influence of changes in maternal functioning associated with core Mom-Net&#xD;
           skills on maternal depressive symptoms. Mediators to be examined include behavior&#xD;
           activation, negative cognitive styles, social support, and belief that mood can be&#xD;
           regulated. Investigators will also examine the mediating influence of change in maternal&#xD;
           depressive symptoms on parenting behavior and child outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Trial Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Prior to the Implementation Phase (i.e., clinical trial), participating agencies will be&#xD;
      randomized to either high- or low-intensity coaching conditions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Head Start (HS) agencies will be randomized to offer Mom-Net with either high- or low- intensity coaching. Subsequently, participants will be randomized to either the Mom-Net condition offered by their child's HS agency or to Treatment as Usual within the community/Waitlist (TAU/WL). Assessments will be conducted at T1- prior to participant randomization, at T2- subsequent to the conclusion of the intervention period, and at T3 1 year after T1. Subsequent to the T2 assessments, participants in the TAU/WL condition will be offered the opportunity to participate in the Mom-Net version offered by their HS agency. The T3 assessment will thus enable us to examine Maintenance of effects for those in the Mom-Net condition, and Replication of Mom-Net within group effects for those in the TAU/WL condition.</intervention_model_description>

Mom-Net's content includes core CBT skills taught in ways that are relevant to one's parenting interactions. Mothers will participate in Mom-Net with either high- or low-intensity coaching as determined by which version their HS was randomized to offer. Coaching is provided by HS staff.&#xD;
In the high-intensity version, coaches provide support both for engaging with the intervention and for learning content. Coaching phone calls occur weekly (20-30 min call per session). In the low-intensity version, coaches provides supportive accountability for engaging with the intervention. Mothers participate in 3 (10-15 min calls occurring post-randomization, and 3- and 6-weeks later.</description>
