  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study examines the implementation and efficacy of a fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      incentive program in a population of adults with diabetes at a community health center (CHC)&#xD;
      in California. Additionally, we seek to understand the impact of this program on the&#xD;
      participants with particular attention to their experience and point of view. To better&#xD;
      understand the program and its impact, a mixed methods approach will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will utilize a mixed methods approach with both qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative methods to assess the process and impact of a fruit and vegetable incentive&#xD;
      program administered in a community clinic that serves a population that is low-income in&#xD;
      Sacramento, California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacramento County has a population of 1.5 million people and 500,000 people living in the&#xD;
      city of Sacramento proper. The poverty rate of the county over all is 12.6% and the city is&#xD;
      16.6%. The most recent estimate of county level food insecurity is 12%, which is consistent&#xD;
      with the national average; however, the estimated rate during the COVID 19 pandemic is 16.5%.&#xD;
      Sacramento also serves as an ideal region for intervention because there is a strong&#xD;
      community partner with the CHC, One Community Health (OCH) and there are regionally&#xD;
      accessible Walmart stores at which the fruit and vegetable incentives (i.e., Walmart gift&#xD;
      cards) can be used. Participants in the study will receive up to $400 in fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      vouchers over 8 months, $50 in voucher given per household each month (paused if no voucher&#xD;
      redemption within prior 2 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention adds a $50 monthly fruit and vegetable voucher, and text reminder and&#xD;
      educational text messages (recipes/tips) to the Standard of Care for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Care for Patients at OCH: Patients/participants will be able to regularly meet with&#xD;
      their healthcare team which includes but is not limited to a primary care physician, nursing&#xD;
      staff, dietitians and other providers as needed. All care is based on evidence-based best&#xD;
      clinical practices and the patient's voluntary involvement with their providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fruit and Vegetable Incentive: During the 8-month intervention period, registered program&#xD;
      participants can receive $50 monthly through the reloadable Walmart gift card, which can only&#xD;
      be used to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables. The total incentive will be $400 for the&#xD;
      eight-month program. Each month, program participants will be able to receive their monthly&#xD;
      $50 incentive, providing their balance at the time of the reload does not exceed $100, due to&#xD;
      two months of inactivity. Monthly reload plan will be made based on available balance during&#xD;
      the first week of each month, with the reload planned for the 15th of each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text Communication: Participants will share a text-enabled phone number with Wholesome Wave&#xD;
      for Wholesome Wave to send text reminders to shop and utilize incentives, likely 2 times per&#xD;
      month. Wholesome Wave will also share text messages that are consistent with the messages&#xD;
      that the OCH dietitians are offering in their standard care, including recipes and tips.&#xD;

    <time_frame>All clinical measurements will be collected at month 1 (baseline) to 8 (completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) will be used to measure the average plasma glucose concentration. HbA1c will be measured using a finger-prick test. HbA1c will be reported as HbA1c% and Blood Glucose (mmol/L). Change in HbA1C will be calculated as end of program HbA1c% - baseline HbA1c%.</description>

    <description>Glycemic control: Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) will be used to measure the average plasma glucose concentration. HbA1c will be measured using a finger-prick test. HbA1c will be reported as HbA1c% and Blood Glucose (mmol/L). Glycemic control will be determined inline with American Diabetes Association guidelines. According to the ADA HbA1C values lower than 5.7% represents a normal range, between 5.7% and 6.5% is prediabetes and greater than 6.5% is diabetes.</description>
