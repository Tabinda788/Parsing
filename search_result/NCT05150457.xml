&#xD;
               1. Hematologic: Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; Absolute neutrophil&#xD;
                  count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (without blood transfusion, platelet transfusion, or&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Coagulation: Patients on full-dose oral anticoagulation, except warfarin, which is an&#xD;
             excluded medication, must be on a stable dose (minimum duration 14 days). Patients on&#xD;

             the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Double contraception is defined as a condom AND one other form of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Established hormonal contraception (with approved oral contraceptive pills,&#xD;
                  long-acting implantable hormones, injectable hormones);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A vaginal ring or an intrauterine device (IUD);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented evidence of surgical sterilization at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
                  Screening (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy for women or vasectomy for men [with appropriate&#xD;
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in semen] provided the male&#xD;
                  partner is a sole partner).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women not of childbearing potential must be post-menopausal for ≥ 12 months.&#xD;
             Post-menopausal status will be confirmed through testing of follicle-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone (FSH) levels ≥ 40 IU/L at Screening for amenorrhoeic female participants.&#xD;
             Females who are abstinent from heterosexual intercourse will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods)&#xD;
             and withdrawal are not considered highly effective methods of birth control. Complete&#xD;
             abstinence for the duration of the study through 90 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             treatment is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the&#xD;
             patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female patients who are in same-sex relationships are not required to use&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Male patients with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial starting with the&#xD;
             Screening visit through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment is received.&#xD;
             Males with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional method of&#xD;
             contraception is required for the pregnant partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of contraception include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomy (&gt; 30 days since vasectomy with no viable sperm);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgical sterility in female partner(s) (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy,&#xD;
                  bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Double contraception, condom AND the use of an effective contraceptive for the&#xD;
                  female partner that includes: oral contraceptive pills, long-acting implantable&#xD;
                  hormones, injectable hormones, a vaginal ring or an IUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with same-sex partners (abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse) are&#xD;
             eligible when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception&#xD;
             method for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Males must not donate sperm for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection should have a&#xD;
             cluster of differentiation 4+ (CD4+) T cell count ≥ 350 cells/µL at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with serological evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) should&#xD;
             have HBV viral load below the limit of quantification at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with serological evidence of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) should have&#xD;
             completed curative antiviral treatment and have HCV viral load below the limit of&#xD;

             immunosuppressive medications as prophylaxis in patients with contrast allergies are&#xD;
             acceptable. In addition, temporary uses of corticosteroids considered non-clinically&#xD;
             significant may be approved on a case-by-case basis in discussion with the Sponsor.&#xD;

             AEs, may be approved on a case-by-case basis in discussion with the Sponsor (e.g.,&#xD;
             hypothyroidism on stable thyroxine replacement, adrenal insufficiency on stable&#xD;
             hormone replacement therapy, diabetes on stable insulin therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;

             of new or enlarging brain metastases, and if taking corticosteroids, are on stable or&#xD;
             decreasing doses for at least 7 days from first dose of study drug. Patients with GBM&#xD;
