  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transposition of great vessels are usually corrected by an arterial switch operation. This&#xD;
      operation is often done during the first week of life as surgical delays lead to&#xD;
      deconditioned left ventricle. On the other hand early surgery carries also risks as neonatal&#xD;
      physiology may have problems adapting to an intervention under cardiopulmonary bypass,&#xD;
      possible pulmonary hypertension. Arterial switch operation between 2008 and 2020 done at our&#xD;
      center will be reviewed. Primary outcome will be mortality or severe postoperative morbidity.&#xD;
      Patients will be divided in 2 groups according to the presence or absence of the primary&#xD;
      outcome. After propensity score matching, they will be analysed according to the timing of&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;

      Scientific background and motivation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transposition of great vessels (TGV) is a congenital heart defect in which the aorta&#xD;
      follows the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery follows the left ventricle. At birth,&#xD;
      the pulmonary and systemic circulations work in parallel and the communication between them&#xD;
      depends on shunts in the cardiac stage (permeability of the Botal hole) or in the&#xD;
      supra-cardiac (ducis arteriosus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's the most common congenital heart disease and his incidence is estimated between 0.7 and&#xD;
      0.8 per 1000 births. It's a pathology that may be associated with other heart defects, such&#xD;
      as interventricular communication (IVC) or pulmonary stenosis, but rarely with a chromosomal&#xD;
      abnormality or malformative syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TGV's manifestation is an isolated cyanosis, refractory to oxygen. And mortality reaches 90%&#xD;
      in the first year of life in absence of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TGV's management has evolved over the last 50 years. First, thanks to the antenatal&#xD;
      ultrasound diagnosis, allowing early strategies in postnatal to maintain a shunt between the&#xD;
      two circulations (Prostaglandin and Balloon atrial septostomy). Then, by the evolution of&#xD;
      corrective surgeries; indeed atrial repair techniques (Senning and Mustard) have given way to&#xD;
      the arterial Switch with coronary reimplantation by microsurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it's possible, the operation takes place during the first week of life. Indeed, it's&#xD;
      well established that surgical delay leads to a risk of left ventricle's deconditioned4 and&#xD;
      sometimes impaired brain growth. But the risks of a premature surgery are less clear:&#xD;
      Operability of the newborn, ability to tolerate an intervention under extracorporeal&#xD;
      circulation (ECC), difficulties related to physiological pulmonary arterial hypertension at&#xD;
      birth must be considered in the operative indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal timing for surgery is still poorly defined. In 2014, Anderson et al showed better&#xD;
      results for arterial Switches performed on the third day of life6. On the other hand, Kumar&#xD;
      et al, also studied the relationship between operative timing and morbi/mortality of several&#xD;
      congenital heart surgeries including the arterial Switch but they found no relationship&#xD;
      between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to establish if there is a relationship between the age of the&#xD;
      newborn at the time of surgery and postoperative morbi/mortality. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators want to review all the medical records of children operated on a TGV by the&#xD;
      arterial Switch technique at HUDERF between 2008 and 2020. The morbidity/mortality criteria&#xD;
      observed will be the same as those usually used in studies conducted on paediatric cardiac&#xD;
      surgery at HUDERF:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The data of interest will be extracted from a database built up over years summing up&#xD;
           the medical records of cardiac operated patients since 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Children will be divided into two groups according to the primary outcome (present or&#xD;
      absent). They will be matched using a propensity analysis and then compared in terms of&#xD;
      operating time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. The influence of operative time on the occurrence of the primary outcome will also be&#xD;
      analysed by a linear regression technique in which the parameter &quot;operating time&quot; will be&#xD;
      considered as a continuous variable.&#xD;
