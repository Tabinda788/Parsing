  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was&#xD;
      discovered for the first time in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and the disease it causes is&#xD;
      called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Now, this pandemic is rapidly spreading all over&#xD;
      the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant have higher rates of COVID-19, associated with hospitalizations, and severe&#xD;
      in-hospital outcomes. Immune responses may have a potential role in the diagnosis, treatment,&#xD;
      and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. So we need of identifying biomarkers for disease&#xD;
      severity and progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      It is important to define whether a novel virus is transmissible from a mother to her infant,&#xD;
      vertical infection, and there are three possible mechanisms for vertical infection -&#xD;
      intrauterine infection (including transplacental and ascending infections), intrapartum&#xD;
      transmission (during delivery), and postpartum infection. These mechanisms have important&#xD;
      implications that can influence obstetrical management decisions, best practice delivery&#xD;
      options, and neonatal care (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of work To detect the effect of time of infection by COVID 19 on the fetomaternal outcome&#xD;
      including vertical transmission, and the immunological and genetic changes during the disease&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All pregnant women eligible for the study will undergo detailed medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each patient will have the following data: • Patient name. • Age. • Past medical and&#xD;
           surgical history. • Menstrual history and contraceptive history: especially emphasis on&#xD;
           Last Menstrual Period to determine the exact gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination of the patients: - General examination of vital data (blood&#xD;
           pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate). CBC, PT, PTT, RBS, ALT, AST, serum&#xD;
           creatinine), and ultrasound will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal examination: to detect any abnormality as intrauterine growth restriction,&#xD;
           with serial ultrasound estimation.&#xD;
