  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive Phase 2/3 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,&#xD;
      parallel, 3 arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DA-1229 compared to placebo in&#xD;
      patients with calcific aortic valve disease with mild to moderate aortic stenosis. There are&#xD;
      3 arms in this study to which patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive the&#xD;
      DA-1229 or placebo orally once daily for a period of 104 weeks . the 3 arms are: placebo,&#xD;
      DA-1229 5mg GroupDA-1229 10 mg Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three phases: Screening Period (up to 4 weeks), Treatment Period (104&#xD;
      weeks), and Follow-Up Period (2-4 weeks). Total Study Duration is112 Weeks.&#xD;
