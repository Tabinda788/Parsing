  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cachexia is defined as a weight loss of more than 5% over the last 6 months, a loss of&#xD;
      body fat and muscle atrophy. It is found in 80% of patients with advanced cancer. In this&#xD;
      context, white adipose tissue is a particularly interesting target since its depletion&#xD;
      precedes the loss of muscle mass, and is sufficient to induce a decrease in the response to&#xD;
      anti-cancer treatments and in the survival of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cachexia is associated with advanced tumors that present acidosis and metastasis. In&#xD;
      this clinical study the investigators would like explore the acid environment effect on the&#xD;
      human adipose tissue depletion and more specifically on adipocyte lipolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the &quot;TuLip&quot; clinical study is therefore to validate in human&#xD;
      subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes that factors secreted by tumor cells cultivated in acid&#xD;
      tumor environment stimulate the release of lipids from adipose tissue. Adipocytes retrieves&#xD;
      from this study will also be used to validate identified potential lipolytic factors derived&#xD;
      from these cells.&#xD;

      This study is a monocentric clinical study. Patients with BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 will be recruited in&#xD;
      the context of programmed abdominal surgery. In this context, subcutaneous and visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissue pieces (1-2 cm3) will be collected to explore the lypolytic response of&#xD;
      adipocytes ex-vivo to factors secreted by human cancer cell lines.&#xD;
