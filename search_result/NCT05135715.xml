      This study is a phase IIa single-center, single-arm, open-label, clinical study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody-Monomethyl&#xD;
      auristatin E (MMAE) conjugate for the treatment of HER2- positive advanced melanoma. HER2&#xD;
      positive is defined as the expression of HER2 protein in the primary tumor or metastatic&#xD;
      tumor tissue as IHC 2+ or IHC 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;

    <time_frame>within approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death (calculated by the event that occurred first). The disease progression will be evaluated by the researchers according to the RECIST 1.1 standard.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of relief (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>within approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>within approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as cases where objective remission (assessed as complete remission or partial remission according to RECIST 1.1 standard) or stable disease during the study.</description>
