    <textblock>
      Brain edema is one of the main mechanisms of secondary brain injury and one factor in the&#xD;
      prognosis of traumatic brain injury . The clinical study of glibenclamide in the treatment of&#xD;
      brain edema after traumatic brain injury is designed to evaluate whether glibenclamide&#xD;
      treatment can improve the blood NSE and S100β levels of severe traumatic brain injury , so&#xD;
      order to explore the efficacy and adverse effects of this drug in the treatment of traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury has high morbidity,disability and mortality ; worldwide, more than 50&#xD;
      million new cases , mainly low and middle-income countries.The annual incidence of&#xD;
      craniocerebral trauma in China is (55 - 64) / 100000 , with 770 - 890 thousand new&#xD;
      cases,causing nearly 100000 deaths and hundreds of thousands of disabilities , which is a&#xD;
      serious public safety problem .Injury mechanisms after traumatic brain injury include primary&#xD;
      and secondary brain injury and have a lack of effective treatment .Brain edema is one of the&#xD;
      main mechanisms of secondary brain injury and one factor in the prognosis of traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury .In recent years , the Sur1-Trpm4 channel was found to play an important role in the&#xD;
      onset of brain edema , with increased expression in traumatic brain injury , ischemic stroke&#xD;
      , and ischemic and hypoxic encephalopathy , and the specific inhibitor glibenclamide can&#xD;
      reduce brain edema .A clinical study of glibenclamide in the treatment of brain edema after&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury to evaluate whether glibenclamide treatment can improve the blood NSE&#xD;
      and S100β levels of severe traumatic brain injury , so order to explore the efficacy and&#xD;
      adverse effects of this drug in the treatment of traumatic brain injury .&#xD;
