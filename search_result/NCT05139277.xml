    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the CONVIVO&#xD;
      confocal endomicroscope in discriminating between normal and abnormal tissue in vivo during&#xD;
      brain tumor surgery. The interpretation of intraoperative images obtained in situ will be&#xD;
      tested against conventional histologic evaluation of targeted biopsies from imaged tissue.&#xD;
      The study team hypothesize that there will be a high degree of correlation between images&#xD;
      obtained with the CONVIVO system and conventional histologic interpretation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The surgical resection of brain tumors is an integral component of modern neuro-oncology. .&#xD;
      Extent of resection has been found to be associated with increased overall and progression&#xD;
      free survival, with the greatest benefit occurring in the setting of a complete or gross&#xD;
      total resection. Unfortunately, there are a number of obstacles unique to brain tumors that&#xD;
      may limit the extent of resection. A number of advancements in neurosurgical oncology have&#xD;
      emerged to improve the extent of tumor resection while decreasing operative morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Confocal reflectance microscopy is a routine technique used to visualize tissues&#xD;
      without fixation or staining used in classical histological techniques. Laser scanning&#xD;
      confocal microscopy (LSCM) is an optical fluorescence imaging modality used for imaging thick&#xD;
      in vivo and ex vivo tissues. Clinically available confocal endomicroscopy systems contain&#xD;
      lasers with precise excitation wavelengths and dichroic filters for detecting appropriate&#xD;
      emission wave lengths. The studies completed to date do not evaluate the ability of confocal&#xD;
      microscopy to discriminate between normal and abnormal tissue at the margins during surgical&#xD;
      resection. This is the first of such in vivo feasibility studies that aims to demonstrate&#xD;
      this claim of the CONVIVO system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images acquired with the CONVIVO system following administration of fluorescein will be&#xD;
      compared to conventional histologic specimens from corresponding biopsies. This is a planned&#xD;
      single center study. This study is designed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the CONVIVO&#xD;
      system compared with gold-standard histopathology in tissue that has already been identified&#xD;
      for resection. The device will not be used to inform surgical decision making, nor will&#xD;
      tissue that would not otherwise be resected be biopsied for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will rely on study investigators, all physicians at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, to&#xD;
      identify subjects. Written consent is required for participation in the study.. There are no&#xD;
      specific medical risks to patients associated with the use of CONVIVO. It is not anticipated&#xD;
      that there are immediate or direct benefits to patients participating in this study. The&#xD;
      CONVIVO imaging data acquired during the procedure will be initially stored on the device's&#xD;
      hard drive and later securely uploaded to an encrypted Dartmouth-Hitchcock server. Patients&#xD;
      will have the ability to maintain their privacy with minimal disruption or contact by the&#xD;
      study team. Additionally, the PI or other investigators will have interactions with the&#xD;
      patient as part of their routine clinical care. Participants are free to withdraw from&#xD;
      participation in the study at any time upon request.&#xD;

    <description>Concordance between in vivo imaging with the CONVIVO system and conventional histologic assessment.The diagnostic performance of the CONVIVO system will be assessed with respect to classification as &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot; tissue. The interpretation of intraoperative images obtained in situ will be tested against conventional histologic evaluation of targeted biopsies from imaged tissue. Pertinent tumors include all intracranial neoplasms including low and high grade glial neoplasms, glioneuronal tumors, cerebral metastasis, meningioma, schwannoma, and pituitary lesions.</description>

    <description>Rate of uninterpretable or non-diagnostic imaging with the CONVIVO system. During the resection the PI or other investigators may image tissue that is ultimately not biopsied. For example at the end of resection if there is a region of interest that cannot be safely resected, the CONVIVO system can be used to image the tissue without obtaining a corresponding tissue specimen for histology. During image acquisition it will be noted and documented by the research team that there is not a corresponding tissue specimen.</description>

    <description>The WHO criteria for the diagnosis of Glioblastoma (GBM) - cell density, cellular pleomorphism, increased mitoses, microvascular proliferation and trpalisading or ischemic necrosis - were all detectable by Confocal EndoMicroscope (CEM). Identification of the infiltration zone or the center of the tumor was possible based upon assessments of cell density comparing the center and border specimens. Additional aspects, e.g. apoptotic figures in perinecrotic pseudopalisading tumor cells, and important histological structures such as giant cells, fibrillary tumor matrix and blood vessels were also visible with CEM. Typical features of CEM in patients with histologically proven meningioma were also seen.</description>

    <description>Following image acquisition, the tissue region imaged with the CONVIVO system will then be biopsied using biopsy forceps. This will be passed immediately off the surgical field as a research specimen and provided to a member of the research team to be prepared for conventional histologic evaluation.

    <description>Approximately 2-5 minutes following administration of FNa in situ imaging will be performed by the participating surgeon ensuring proper technique. Prior to entering the surgical field, the probe will be covered in a disposable sterile sheath that is manufactured with quality assurance for this purpose. The probe will gently be held against the tissue interface while imaging occurs. Again this will only be in regions that would normally be resected or sampled in routine clinical care. Following image acquisition, a neuropathologist present in the operating room, will review and capture each image.</description>
