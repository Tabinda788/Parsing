      This trial aims to assess the impact of SRS on overall survival, PFS, radiation toxicity and&#xD;
      quality of life as compared to WBRT in oligometastatic brain disease in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. Total 98 patients with breast cancer with brain oligo-metastases will be included.&#xD;
      The WBRT dosage schedule will be 30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. For tumors with 2cm, SRS&#xD;
      dose of 22 to 25 Gy will be delivered and tumor larger than 2 cm will be treated with doses&#xD;
      of 18 to 20 Gy.&#xD;

      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To assess the impact of SRS on overall survival, brain tumour recurrence&#xD;
      and radiation toxicity with oligometastatic brain metastasis as compared to patients who&#xD;
      receive WBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End Point: Overall Survival (OS) Secondary End Points: Progression Free Survival&#xD;
      (PFS) Toxic Effects of Radiation Quality of Life DETAILED RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Study Setting:&#xD;
      Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and&#xD;
      Research, Chandigarh Study Design: Prospective hospital based study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;=18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed malignancy with metastatic disease detected on imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 to 3 brain metastases, each with a maximum diameter of no more than 3 cm on contrast&#xD;
           enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious medical comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG &gt;= 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior Brain Radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt;3 brain metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum diameter &gt;4cm on MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, a complete history and physical examination by the treating radiation&#xD;
      oncologist will be done. Histologically confirmation of malignancy is required, with&#xD;
      metastatic disease detected on imaging. Prior to randomization, the patients will be&#xD;
      stratified based on number of brain metastases (single vs 2-3), extent of extracranial&#xD;
      disease (active vs stable). Extracranial disease will be considered to be stable when the&#xD;
      tumor had been clinically controlled for 6 months or longer prior to the detection of brain&#xD;
      metastases. After informed consent, eligible patients will be randomised in two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WBRT dosage schedule will be 30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. For Arm 1, Treatment&#xD;
      planning is to be done using CT simulation or conventional simulation (fluoroscopy). Simple&#xD;
      beam arrangements, such as parallel opposed beams, will be favoured wherever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in Arm 2 will undergo planning CT simulation with 1mm slice thickness. For all&#xD;
      lesions, the gross tumor volume (GTV) will be defined as the visible tumor on CT and/or MRI&#xD;
      imaging. A Planning Target Volume (PTV) margin of 2-5 mm will be added. Organs at risk&#xD;
      visible in the planning CT scan will be contoured. The doses will be prescribed to&#xD;
      approximately 100% isodose level and 95% of the PTV should receive 95% of the prescription&#xD;
      dose. Metastases with a maximum diameter of up to 2 cm will be treated with doses of 22 to 25&#xD;
      Gy and those larger than 2 cm will be treated with doses of 18 to 20 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations and MRI scans will be done 1 and 3 months after treatment and every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter. In cases in which a recurrence will be detected, further treatment can be&#xD;
      administered. The size of the treated lesions will be measured in 3 dimensions, and this&#xD;
      size, the development of new brain metastases, and the development of leukoencephalopathy&#xD;
      associated with radiological findings (according to the National Cancer Institute's Common&#xD;
      Toxicity Criteria version 4.0319) will be scored based on serial MRI scans. Overall survival&#xD;
      will be measured as time until death from any cause, and progression-free survival as time to&#xD;
      either progression or death, whichever occurs first. Lesion response will be evaluated in&#xD;
      this study using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee20. At each visit, functional status and neurologic toxic&#xD;
      effects will be scored. Systemic functional status will be evaluated by using the KPS score.&#xD;
      Neurologic function will be evaluated according to the criteria listed21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to detect an improvement in overall survival. The study will therefore be&#xD;
      designed with 80% power. It is estimated that the median survival of the control group after&#xD;
      randomization in this study will be 9 months. In order to detect a 6-month improvement in&#xD;
      median survival from 9 months to 15 months with SRS, a total of 93 patients will be needed.&#xD;
      Assuming a 5% rate of loss to follow up, a total of 98 patients will be accrued. The study&#xD;
      projects accrual over 48 months with 12 months of additional follow-up. Survival will be&#xD;
      calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with differences compared using the stratified&#xD;
      log-rank test. A Cox multivariable regression analysis will be used to determine baseline&#xD;
      factors predictive of survival. Differences in rates of grade 2 or higher toxicity between&#xD;
      groups will be tested usingthe Fisher's Exact Test. Differences in progression free survival&#xD;
      will be tested using the stratified log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novelty of study: This trial aims to assess the impact of SRS on overall survival, PFS,&#xD;
      radiation toxicity and quality of life as compared to WBRT in oligometastatic brain disease&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients. It may lead to better understanding of role of SRS in&#xD;
      oligometastatic paradigm.&#xD;

    <description>At each visit, functional status and neurologic toxic effects will be scored. Systemic functional status will be evaluated by using the KPS score. KPS will be scored 80-100 if the patient is able to carry on normal activity and to work without special care. A score of 50-70 will indicate patient is unable to work; live at home and care for most personnel needs; varying amount of assistance required. A score of 10-30 indicate that unable to care for self; requires equivalent of hospital or institutional care; disease may be progressing rapidly. A score of 0 means patient is dead. Neurologic function will be evaluated according to the MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION. Patients will be scored for each question from 0-30. Degree of impairment will be graded as severe if the score is 0-10, moderate if the score is 10-20, mild between 20-25 and questionable significant if the score is 25-30.</description>
