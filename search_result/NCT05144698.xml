    <textblock>
      The therapy of solid tumors has been revolutionized by immune therapy, in particular,&#xD;
      approaches that activate immune T cells in a polyclonal manner through blockade of checkpoint&#xD;
      pathways such as PD-1 by administration of monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the adoptive transfer of RAPA-201 cells, which are checkpoint-deficient polyclonal T&#xD;
      cells that represent an analogous yet distinct immune therapy treatment platform for solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAPA-201 is a second-generation immunotherapy product consisting of reprogrammed autologous&#xD;
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of Th1/Tc1 cytokine phenotype. First-generation RAPA-101, which was&#xD;
      bred for resistance to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, demonstrated clear anti-tumor effects in&#xD;
      multiple myeloma patients without any product-related adverse events. Second-generation&#xD;
      RAPA-201, which have acquired resistance to the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, are manufactured&#xD;
      ex vivo from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from solid tumor patients using a&#xD;
      steady-state apheresis. RAPA-201 is also being evaluated for the therapy of relapsed,&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma and was granted Fast Track Status by the FDA for this indication.&#xD;
      The novel RAPA-201 manufacturing platform, which incorporates both an mTOR inhibitor&#xD;
      (temsirolimus) and an anti-cancer Th1/Tc1 polarizing agent (IFN-alpha) generates polyclonal T&#xD;
      cells with five key characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Th1/Tc1: polarization to anti-cancer Th1 and Tc1 subsets, with commensurate&#xD;
           down-regulation of immune suppressive Th2 and regulatory T (TREG) subsets;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. T Central Memory: expression of a T central memory (TCM) phenotype, which promotes T&#xD;
           cell engraftment and persistence for prolonged anti-tumor effects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Temsirolimus-Resistance: acquisition of temsirolimus-resistance, which translates into a&#xD;
           multi-faceted anti-apoptotic phenotype that improves T cell fitness in the stringent&#xD;
           conditions of the tumor microenvironment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. T Cell Quiescence: reduced T cell activation, as evidence by reduced expression of the&#xD;
           IL-2 receptor CD25, which reduces T cell-mediated cytokine toxicities such as&#xD;
           cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) that limit other forms of T cell therapy; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reduced Checkpoints: multiple checkpoint inhibitory receptors are markedly reduced on&#xD;
           RAPA-201 cells (including but not limited to PD-1, CTLA4, TIM-3, LAG3, and LAIR1), which&#xD;
           increases T cell immunity in the checkpoint-replete, immune suppressive tumor&#xD;
           microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Simon 2-stage, non-randomized, open label, multi-site, phase I/II trial of RAPA-201&#xD;
      T immune cell therapy in patients with advanced metastatic, recurrent, and unresectable solid&#xD;
      tumors that have recurred or relapsed after prior immune therapy. Patients must have tumor&#xD;
      relapse after at least one prior line of therapy and must have refractory status to the most&#xD;
      recent regimen, which must include an anti-PD-(L)1 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, accrual&#xD;
      is limited to solid tumor disease types potentially amenable to standard-of-care salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy consisting of the carboplatin + paclitaxel (CP) regimen that will be utilized&#xD;
      for host conditioning prior to RAPA-201 therapy. Importantly, carboplatin and paclitaxel are&#xD;
      &quot;immunogenic&quot; chemotherapy agents whereby the resultant cancer cell death mechanism is&#xD;
      favorable for generation of anti-tumor immune T cell responses. Thus, the CP regimen that&#xD;
      this protocol incorporates is intended to directly control tumor progression and indirectly&#xD;
      promote anti-tumor T cell immunity. The CP regimen is considered standard-of-care therapy for&#xD;
      the following tumor types, which will be focused upon on this RAPA-201 protocol: small cell&#xD;
      and non-small cell lung cancer; breast cancer (triple-negative sub-type or relapse after&#xD;
      ovarian ablation/suppression); gastric cancer (esophageal and esophageal-gastric-junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma; gastric adenocarcinoma; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma); head and neck&#xD;
      cancer (squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity, larynx, nasopharynx, and other sites);&#xD;
      carcinoma of unknown primary; bladder cancer; and malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol therapy consists of six cycles of standard-of-care chemotherapy (carboplatin +&#xD;
      paclitaxel (CP) regimen) administered every 28 days (chemotherapy administered on cycles day&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15). RAPA-201 cells will be administered at a target flat dose of 400 X 10^6 cells&#xD;
      per infusion on day 3 of cycles 2 through 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of up to 22 patients was selected to determine whether RAPA-201 therapy, when&#xD;
      used in combination with the CP regimen, represents an active regimen in solid tumors that&#xD;
      are resistant to anti-PD(L)-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, as defined by a response rate (≥&#xD;
      PR) consistent with a rate of 35%. The first stage of protocol accrual will consist of n=10&#xD;
      patients; to advance to the second protocol accrual stage, RAPA-201 therapy must result in a&#xD;
      tumor response (≥ PR) in at least 2 out of the 10 initial patients.&#xD;

      The therapy of solid tumors has been revolutionized by immune therapy, in particular,&#xD;
      approaches that activate immune T cells in a polyclonal manner through blockade of checkpoint&#xD;
      pathways such as PD-1 by administration of monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the adoptive transfer of a reprogrammed T cell population termed RAPA-201 cells,&#xD;
      which are checkpoint-deficient polyclonal T cells that represent an analogous yet distinct&#xD;
      treatment platform for solid tumor immune therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAPA-201 is a second-generation T cell immunotherapy product that is comprised of autologous&#xD;
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of Th1/Tc1 cytokine phenotype. The first-generation RAPA-101 product,&#xD;
      which was bred for resistance to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and developed for therapy of&#xD;
      multiple myeloma, demonstrated clear anti-tumor effects without any product-related adverse&#xD;
      events. The second-generation RAPA-201 cells, which have acquired resistance to the mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitor temsirolimus, are manufactured ex vivo from peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      collected from solid tumor patients using a steady-state apheresis. RAPA-201 cells are also&#xD;
      being evaluated for the therapy of relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma and was granted Fast&#xD;
      Track Status by the FDA for this indication. The novel method of RAPA-201 manufacturing,&#xD;
      which incorporates both an mTOR inhibitor (temsirolimus) and an anti-cancer Th1/Tc1&#xD;
      polarizing agent (IFN-alpha) generates a polyclonal T cell population with the following five&#xD;
      key characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Th1/Tc1: polarization to the anti-cancer Th1 and Tc1 subsets, with commensurate&#xD;
           down-regulation of immune suppressive Th2 and regulatory T (TREG) subsets;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. T Central Memory: expression of a T central memory (TCM) phenotype, which promotes T&#xD;
           cell engraftment and persistence necessary for prolonged anti-tumor effects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Temsirolimus-Resistance: acquisition of temsirolimus-resistance, which translates into a&#xD;
           multi-faceted anti-apoptotic phenotype that improves T cell fitness in the stringent&#xD;
           conditions of the tumor microenvironment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. T Cell Quiescence: reduced T cell activation, as evidence by reduced expression of the&#xD;
           IL-2 receptor CD25, which reduces the chance of T cell-mediated cytokine toxicities such&#xD;
           as cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) that limit other forms of T cell therapy; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reduced Checkpoints: multiple checkpoint inhibitory receptors are markedly reduced on&#xD;
           RAPA-201 cells (including but not limited to PD-1, CTLA4, TIM-3, LAG3, and LAIR1), which&#xD;
           increases T cell immunity in the checkpoint-replete, immune suppressive tumor&#xD;
           microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-site phase II study evaluating RAPA-201 cells in up to 22 patients with&#xD;
      relapsed solid tumors who have disease progression after anti-PD1 pathway monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      therapy. The study will evaluate adoptive T cell therapy using autologous rapamycin-resistant&#xD;
      Th1/Tc1 cells (RAPA-201) in the context of a standard-of-care chemotherapy regimen comprised&#xD;
      of carboplatin plus paclitaxel (CP Regimen). The study will only accrue patients with solid&#xD;
      tumor types that support use of the CP Regimen as a salvage therapy. Importantly, carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel are considered &quot;immunogenic&quot; chemotherapy whereby the resultant cancer cell&#xD;
      death mechanism is favorable for the generation of anti-tumor immune T cell responses.&#xD;
      Therefore, the CP regimen that this protocol incorporates is intended to both directly&#xD;
      control tumor progression and indirectly promote anti-tumor T cell immunity. The CP regimen&#xD;
      is considered standard-of-care therapy for the following tumor types, which will therefore be&#xD;
      focused upon on this RAPA-201 protocol: small cell and non-small cell lung cancer; breast&#xD;
      cancer (triple-negative sub-type or relapse after ovarian ablation/suppression); gastric&#xD;
      cancer (esophageal and esophageal-gastric-junction adenocarcinoma; gastric adenocarcinoma;&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma); head and neck cancer (squamous cell carcinoma of oral&#xD;
      cavity, larynx, nasopharynx, and other sites); carcinoma of unknown primary; bladder cancer;&#xD;
      and malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for the protocol, a subject will be required to have a circulating absolute&#xD;
      lymphocyte count (ALC) of ≥ 800 cells per microliter. This parameter will help ensure that a&#xD;
      sufficient number of autologous RAPA-201 cells can be manufactured from a steady-state&#xD;
      apheresis product. Once the apheresis product has been received at the manufacturing site,&#xD;
      the subject can initiate the first cycle of the CP Regimen, which will be administered over a&#xD;
      28-day interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 10 days after positive determination of study eligibility (and subject enrollment),&#xD;
      two key actions will occur: (1) T cells will be collected by steady-state apheresis and sent&#xD;
      to the manufacturing site at Rapa Therapeutics; (2) and the patient will start Cycle 1 of the&#xD;
      CP Regimen (with a window of up to 7 calendar days to begin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Carboplatin-Paclitaxel (CP) regimen will be given alone for Cycle 1 and in combination&#xD;
      with RAPA-201 cells for Cycles 2-6. After the completion of the treatment portion of the&#xD;
      study, the subject will enter the follow-up component that will last for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1 of the CP Regimen will be a 28-day cycle, which will allow for time to manufacture&#xD;
      the RAPA-201 cell product. According to standard-of-care practice, the carboplatin and&#xD;
      paclitaxel will be administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Each cycle, beginning&#xD;
      with Cycle 1, may be delayed or extended for up to four weeks, if needed for various reasons,&#xD;
      including: logistical considerations, resolution of adverse events, or if there is a delay in&#xD;
      RAPA-201 manufacturing. Requests for using additional time between cycles, other than the&#xD;
      visit windows specified in the Schedule of Events, should be approved by the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles 2-6 will also be 28-day cycles but will include both the CP Regimen plus the infusion&#xD;
      of RAPA-201 cells at a target flat dose of 400 X 10^6 cells per infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of up to 22 patients was selected to determine whether RAPA-201 therapy, when&#xD;
      used in combination with the CP regimen, represents an active regimen in solid tumors that&#xD;
      are resistant to anti-PD(L)-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, as defined by achieving a&#xD;
      response rate (≥ PR) consistent with a rate of 35%. The first stage of protocol accrual will&#xD;
      consist of n=10 patients; to advance to the second stage of protocol accrual, RAPA-201&#xD;
      therapy must result in a tumor response (≥ PR) in at least 2 out of the 10 initial patients.&#xD;
