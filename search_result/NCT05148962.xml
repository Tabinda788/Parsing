    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of 2 different doses (10 or 30&#xD;
      mcg) of GRT-R910 when administered as a boost in healthy elderly adults ≥60 years and&#xD;
      previously vaccinated with a first-generation COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca; Cohorts 1 and 2)&#xD;
      or other adenoviral or mRNA-based first-generation COVID-19 vaccine (Cohorts 3 and 4).&#xD;
