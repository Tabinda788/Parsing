  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to learn more about how exercising at different times&#xD;
      of the day (morning versus evening) affects body weight, sleep, eating patterns, and other&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Does the time of day that exercise is performed matter for weight loss? The objective of this&#xD;
      proposal is to examine the impact of an equivalent dose of morning vs. evening aerobic&#xD;
      exercise on change in body weight, energy intake (EI) and components of energy expenditure&#xD;
      (EE) in adults with overweight or obesity. Nearly two-thirds of US adults who attempt to lose&#xD;
      weight report engaging in exercise as a primary strategy for weight loss. However, weight&#xD;
      loss from exercise alone is often substantially less than predicted based on calories burned&#xD;
      in exercise. This is due to compensatory changes that occur in response to exercise&#xD;
      initiation (e.g. increases in EI and decreases in non-exercise EE) that limit the energy&#xD;
      deficit produced by exercise. Thus, strategies that reduce the compensatory response to&#xD;
      exercise could enhance the weight loss efficacy of exercise. It is possible that exercise&#xD;
      time of day could impact compensatory behaviors and weight loss, however, there have been no&#xD;
      adequately powered, prospective, randomized studies comparing weight loss induced by morning&#xD;
      vs. evening exercise. The study design is a 7-month supervised trial in which adults with&#xD;
      overweight or obesity will be randomized to supervised aerobic exercise (2000 kcal/wk)&#xD;
      performed either in the morning (AM-Ex, 6-10 AM) or the evening (PM-Ex, 3-7 PM). The&#xD;
      supervised exercise phase will be followed by a 6-month maintenance phase during which&#xD;
      participants continue to exercise at the target of 2000 kcal/week during the randomized AM or&#xD;
      PM exercise windows, but exercise is no longer supervised. Aim 1 will compare the effects of&#xD;
      AM-Ex vs. PM-Ex on changes in body weight and body composition with the primary study outcome&#xD;
      of weight change at 7-months. Aim 2 will compare the effects of AM-Ex vs PM-Ex on changes in&#xD;
      EI and appetite. Aim 3 will compare the effects of AM-Ex vs PM-Ex on changes in EE,&#xD;
      non-exercise physical activity and sedentary time. Exploratory Aim 4 will compare the effects&#xD;
      of AM-Ex vs PM-Ex on changes in meal and sleep timing. This approach is rigorous and&#xD;
      innovative as the exercise energy deficit will be matched between groups, exercise will be&#xD;
      prescribed based on EE, and free-living total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and EI will be&#xD;
      assessed objectively (using doubly-labeled water). This study is significant as it could&#xD;
      provide important insight on how the timing of exercise impacts weight loss and compensatory&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;

Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait-reduced (FCQ-T-r) is a Likert Scale using scoring associated with it Strongly disagree = 1, Disagree = 2, Neither agree nor disagree = 3, Agree= 4, Strongly agree = 5. The FCI-II is scored on a Likert scale from 1-5, with 1 being &quot;Never,&quot; 5 being &quot;Always/Almost every day.&quot; It has 4 subscales: High Fats, Sweets, Carbohydrates/Starches, and Fast-Food Fats. The score for each subscale is obtained by averaging the responses to the items listed for the subscale. The total score is obtained by averaging the responses to all 28 items.</description>

    <measure>Aspects of Eating Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0) - 13 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire at baseline, 3.5, 7, and 13 months. This assessment is designed to measure 3 dimensions of human eating behavior: cognitive restraint of eating (Factor I - 20 items), disinhibition (Factor II - 16 items), and hunger (Factor III - 15 items). The minimum score for factors I-II-III is therefore 0-0-0, and maximum possible score is 20-16-15. Part I includes items 1-36 and are rated either 1-True or 0-False. Part II includes items 37-51 and is rated on a 4-point scale with the exception of item 50, which is rated on a 6-point scale.</description>
