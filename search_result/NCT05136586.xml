  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is a newly implemented evaluation standard&#xD;
      for medical student and is a determinant part of the national competition they have to&#xD;
      undergo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical studies, especially during examen period, are significantly associated with risk of&#xD;
      developping depressions or anxious trouble, wich led to lesser performance, impaired&#xD;
      memorization and impaired workload capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relaxation breathing techniques coupled with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback and&#xD;
      meditation are procedures used to reduce the stress level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no study on the effect of stress management procedures on the performance&#xD;
      during OSCE for medical student.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, monocentric study will take place during mandatory rehearsal of&#xD;
      Objective Structured Clinical Examination for third year medical student. For examination&#xD;
      purpose, the students will be divided in four groups that will undergo identical exam in the&#xD;
      same time in four parallels circuits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before entering the circuit, all the students will received information for the study and&#xD;
      sign consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the students will be equipped with emWAve® devices that allows us to collect heart rate&#xD;
      variability as physiological stress marker during the time of the intervention. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo short questionnaires regarding perceived stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the groups of students will be randomized in four interventions groups for receiving a&#xD;
      combination of intervention before and/or after the examination circuit. All the&#xD;
      interventions last six minutes long. The randomisation groups are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relaxing breathing exercise coupled with biofeedback before the circuit, no intervention&#xD;
           after&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meditative stimulation audio tape before the circuit, no intervention after&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardised video as controlled group before the circuit and a relaxing breathing&#xD;
           exercise coupled with biofeedback after&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardised video as controlled group before and not intervention after&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the examination circuit, all the students will undergo short questionnaires&#xD;
      regarding stress, participants will get equipped with emWAve ® devices again and participants&#xD;
      will get the second intervention depending on the randomisation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective is to show that relaxing breathing exercise coupled with biofeedback or&#xD;
      meditative stimulation is better than an standardised video on performance during OSCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is student grade at the exam, as determined by university evaluator who is&#xD;
      blind to the intervention and with no links to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to compare the effects of the interventions on measured&#xD;
      physiological stress, psychological stress, and negative rumination.&#xD;
