  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 272 patients were randomly allocated into two groups, Patients in group A were&#xD;
      treated with Macintosh laryngoscope and in groups B with McCoy laryngoscope was used for&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation. Pulse and systolic blood pressure was recorded by non-invasive&#xD;
      measures before laryngoscopy and at 30 seconds, 2 and 3minutes after intubation. All this&#xD;
      information was recorded on a Pro forma.&#xD;

      After taking approval from hospital ethical committee, 272 patients who reported to Operation&#xD;
      Theatre of CMH, Jhelum were selected for the study. Informed consent was obtained and patient&#xD;
      demographic information (name, age, contact) was recorded. Patients were randomly divided in&#xD;
      two equal groups by using lottery method. GROUP A: Where Macintosh laryngoscope was used for&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation. GROUP B: Where McCoy laryngoscope was used for endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before reporting to Operation theatre a detailed pre anesthesia assessment was done in all&#xD;
      patients, all necessary laboratory investigations were collected. On OT table pulse and&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure was checked by non-invasive method. 18G cannula was passed and ECG&#xD;
      was attached. A pillow was placed under the head to obtain classical sniffing position for&#xD;
      intubation. All the patients were pre medicated with injection midazolam 0.08mg/kg, injection&#xD;
      nalbuphine 0.1 mg/kg, injection dexamethasone 0.08mg/kg and injection metoclopramide 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg. Pre oxygenation was done with 100% oxygen for 3 mins. Induction was done with&#xD;
      injection propofol2 mg/kg, muscle relaxation achieved with injection atracurium 0.5mg/kg.&#xD;
      Laryngoscopy was started after 3 minutes by a qualified anesthetist. Pulse and systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure was recorded by non-invasive measures before laryngoscopy and at 30 seconds, 2 and&#xD;
      3minutes after intubation. All this information was recorded on a Proforma.&#xD;
