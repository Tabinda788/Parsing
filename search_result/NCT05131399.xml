      The objective of this study is to assess the superiority in achieving personal goals (set by&#xD;
      the patient and the medical team) according to the GAS scale (Goal Attainment Scaling) while&#xD;
      wearing the carbon medical device Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) compared to a standard plastic&#xD;
      ankle foot orthosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Foot drop is a symptom observed in various pathologies including neuro-muscular pathologies&#xD;
      of peripheral or central origin. It is a walking disability, causing a deterioration in the&#xD;
      patients autonomy and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current medical strategy focuses on various off-the-shelf or custom made devices,&#xD;
      depending on the walking functional impairment and the characteristics of foot deformities.&#xD;

The timing of the transition from one phase to the next will be randomized. The duration of each of the phases (A1, B1, A2, B2) will therefore be defined randomly, while maintaining a total duration of 12 weeks for each study schema.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Comparison of the ability to achieve personal goals while wearing carbon or standard plastic ankle foot orthosis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 times a week during 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Personal goals achievement is evaluated via the Goal attainment scaling (GAS). Before starting the study, three personal objectives are defined according to patients needs and investigator review.&#xD;
Raw scores ranging from -3 (degradation) to +2 (maximum achievement of the objective) are defined:&#xD;
&quot;-3&quot; corresponding to degradation &quot;-2&quot; corresponding to the initial state &quot;-1&quot; corresponding to a partial objective achievement &quot;0&quot; corresponding to the total objective achievement &quot;+1&quot; corresponding to a better objective achievement &quot;+2&quot; corresponding to the maximum objective achievement. The GAS is filled 3 times a week during 12 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>Visits V0 (Day 0), V1 (between week 2 and 3), V2 (between week 5 and 6), V3 (between week 8 and 9) and V4 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's stability is assessed by 2 means:&#xD;
via the Timed Up and Go test : time (in seconds) to realize the test. The patient should stand up from a chair, walk a distance of three meters, turn around, then walk back to the chair and sit down. These tasks should be performed at a comfortable and safe speed.&#xD;
via the number of falls recorded during each phase and their context</description>

    <measure>Comparison of patients disability evolution according to the investigator while wearing carbon or standard plastic ankle foot orthosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Visits V0 (Day 0), V1 (between week 2 and 3), V2 (between week 5 and 6), V3 (between week 8 and 9) and V4 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Doctors' opinion on the Patients disability evolution is measured by the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) questionnaire.&#xD;
The scale has 7 levels of answer from &quot;very strongly improved&quot; which is the better outcome (= 1 point) to &quot;very strongly aggravated&quot; which is the worst outcome (= 7 points) .Intermediate levels are: &quot; Significantly improved &quot;(= 2 points) ; &quot; Slightly improved &quot; (= 3 points) ; &quot; No improvement &quot; (=4 points) ; &quot; Slightly worsen &quot; (=5 points) ; &quot; Seriously worsen&quot; ( = 6 points).&#xD;
The highest score corresponds to the most impairment in quality of life.</description>

    <description>Patient's opinion on his disability evolution is measured by the Global Impression of Change (PCI-C).&#xD;
The scale has 7 levels from &quot;no change or condition has got worsed&quot;(worse outcome) to &quot;a great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference ( better outcome)&quot;. Intermediate levels are: &quot;almost the same, hardly any change at all&quot;; &quot;a little better, but no noticeable change&quot;, &quot;somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference&quot;; &quot;moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change&quot;; &quot;better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference.</description>

    <description>Pain level is measured by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) completed by the patient : 0 corresponds to no pain (better outcome) and 10 to maximum pain (worst outcome).&#xD;
Natural gait and confidence in walking are measured by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) completed by the patient : 0 corresponds to no natural gait or no confidence (worst outcome) and 10 to better natural gait and better confidence (better outcome).&#xD;
