  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter Phase 2, non-randomized, open-label single-group frontline study&#xD;
      administering asciminib in patients with newly diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia-Chronic&#xD;
      Phase (CML-CP). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of asciminib in&#xD;
      newly diagnosed CML-CP. Patients will receive asciminib orally twice daily. Response is&#xD;
      determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) blood test during the study. Patients who have&#xD;
      not achieved a response after 24 months of single agent asciminib will be offered the&#xD;
      addition of nilotinib. Nilotinib will be started at 300 mg BID in addition to asciminib if&#xD;
      indicated. Patients will discontinue study treatment if they experience disease progression,&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asciminib is a potent allosteric inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 oncogene that confers resistance to&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Asciminib has potential to combine with TKIs to prevent&#xD;
      the emergence of BCR-ABL1 mutations, increasing the depth of molecular response in CML-CP&#xD;
      patients. Anticipated enrollment is 50 subjects across sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the proportion of patients with previously untreated CML-CP attaining deep&#xD;
      molecular response (PCR blood test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the proportion of patients achieving molecular response at specific time&#xD;
           points&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the time to molecular response&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the duration of hematologic and molecular response to asciminib&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To define the time to progression and overall survival for patients with CML in early CP&#xD;
           treated with asciminib&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the safety profile of asciminib in patients with CML-CP&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the development of ABL mutations for patients with CML in early CP treated&#xD;
           with asciminib&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To analyze differences in response rates and in prognosis within different risk groups&#xD;
           and patient characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To evaluate patient-reported outcomes in patients with CML receiving asciminib&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To investigate treatment-free remission after at least 2 years of sustained deep&#xD;
           molecular remission for patients receiving single agent asciminib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of concomitant use of nilotinib with asciminib in&#xD;
           patients who have not achieved MR4.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the rate of successful treatment discontinuation for patients using the&#xD;
           combination of asciminib and nilotinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the role of Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) in predicting TFR&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluating the correlation between the gene expression signature of patients and the&#xD;
           chances of achieving MMR and DMR&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate whether B, NK and T cells DNA mutation and RNA expression are relevant and&#xD;
           whether they can predict response in patients with CML using single cell analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria of the study. No&#xD;
      enrollment waivers will be granted. After successful screening, subjects will be enrolled and&#xD;
      treatment will start within 7 days of enrollment. Eligible subjects will begin asciminib on&#xD;
      cycle 1 day 1 of the trial. After 2 years, subjects will be offered the addition of taking&#xD;
      nilotinib with asciminib if a molecular response is not met (PCR blood test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of each participant is expected to take approximately 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen Description Study Drug Dose Route Schedule Cycle Length Asciminib 40 mg Oral Twice a&#xD;
      day (BID) 4 weeks (28 days) Nilotinib 300 mg* Oral Twice a day (BID) 4 weeks (28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Nilotinib will be taken if indicated at a maximum dose of 300mg BID&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose levels and dose modifications of the study drugs will be made per protocol.&#xD;
