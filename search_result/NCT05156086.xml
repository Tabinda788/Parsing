  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a noninterventional prospective study examining the efficacy of&#xD;
      additional dosage of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients (KTRs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical, prospective, non-interventional study to assess the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      additional dose of COVID-19 vaccination, we evaluated the seroconversion rate of KTRs after&#xD;
      the booster shot. Consecutive individuals who have completed standard two-doses of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination were enrolled. Following consent, demographic and clinical data were collected&#xD;
      from participants, including patient/ transplant characteristics and information regarding&#xD;
      previous COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Study visit and sample collection Patients were invited to return for up to 2 follow-up&#xD;
      visits for sample collection. Whole blood samples were collected two weeks to 1 day before&#xD;
      the booster vaccination and 4 weeks after. During the visit for the second blood sample, a&#xD;
      survey was conducted to assess booster-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of&#xD;
      the S1 subunit of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      2(SARS-CoV-2) were quantified with SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (Abbott).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, neutralizing antibody was assessed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 GenScript cPass&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit. The cPass detection kit utilizes the&#xD;
      horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein and the human&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein. It detects neutralizing antibodies&#xD;
      capable of blocking protein interaction between HRP-RBD and ACE2. The assay was performed&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
