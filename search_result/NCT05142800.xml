  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a prospective, longitudinal study designed to track edema and Breast Cancer Related&#xD;
      Lymphedema (BCRL) onset in breast cancer patients taking targeted therapy treatments for&#xD;
      early and metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Perometer and Sozo devise will be used to measure volume changes&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare patients' relative arm volume changes and symptoms data from before&#xD;
      drug therapy throughout drug treatment and for up to six months after treatment has finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Perometer and Sozo device will be used to measure volume changes&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be accrued at Massachusetts General Hospital for a target accrual of&#xD;
      142 participants&#xD;
