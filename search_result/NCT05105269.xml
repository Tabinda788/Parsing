  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some people are more at risk than others, developing a painful Achilles tendon&#xD;
      (known as Achilles tendinopathy) can affect anyone. It is a common and disabling condition&#xD;
      affecting walking, running and work. To reduce the pain and disability, exercise is a&#xD;
      commonly used treatment by physiotherapists. However, success varies. This is why the&#xD;
      proposed research is needed, to identify the factors that predict changes in pain and&#xD;
      disability from treatment with a physiotherapist. The investigators' previous research&#xD;
      suggests the working relationship or 'alliance' between the physiotherapist and patient, the&#xD;
      patient's expectations, and the patient's confidence to carry out exercise might be&#xD;
      important, but further research is needed to determine this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a multi-centre, longitudinal cohort study to assess whether&#xD;
      working alliance, patient expectations of treatment success, and confidence to perform&#xD;
      exercise (self-efficacy) predict changes in pain and disability from a treatment programme&#xD;
      prescribed by a physiotherapist for Achilles tendinopathy at twelve weeks. Patients,&#xD;
      diagnosed with Achilles tendinopathy by their treating physiotherapist, will be introduced to&#xD;
      the study through a verbal discussion and provided with details of the study's website&#xD;
      (www.managing-achilles-pain.com). The website provides password protected information (the&#xD;
      participant information sheet, consent form and a questionnaire measuring clinical outcomes&#xD;
      and the predictive factors). The participant is asked to complete the questionnaire on three&#xD;
      occasions; baseline, six weeks later and twelve weeks after baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain related to a tendon, termed tendinopathy, can be traumatic or insidious in onset and&#xD;
      short-lasting or persistent in nature. Tendinopathy is common musculoskeletal condition; the&#xD;
      incidence of tendinopathy is higher than osteoarthritis, for example. Achilles tendinopathy&#xD;
      (AT) affects both active and sedentary individuals and can be characterised by reduced&#xD;
      activity tolerance to specific tasks that load the tendon. This results in decreased activity&#xD;
      participation such as walking, running and working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical guidelines recommend exercise as the first line treatment for people with&#xD;
      Achilles tendinopathy. However, the rate and extent of improvement in pain and disability&#xD;
      varies. This variation suggests the investigators need to understand what factors predict&#xD;
      change so the investigators can enhance care provided. Previously it was suggested that&#xD;
      exercise worked by improving the strength or structure of the tendon, but it has been&#xD;
      reported that pain and disability can change without corresponding changes in strength or&#xD;
      structure. This suggests that other factors might be important predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent literature suggests cognitive and contextual influences such as self-efficacy, working&#xD;
      alliance and expectations may be important factors for predicting change in pain and&#xD;
      disability in tendinopathy and need investigation. Based on this need, high-quality research&#xD;
      is warranted. To inform the development of this research, two recent studies have been&#xD;
      undertaken. Firstly, a feasibility study was completed. This study aimed to understand if it&#xD;
      was feasible to collect data using a secure website to explore the association and predictive&#xD;
      relationship of working alliance, outcome expectations and self-efficacy with pain and&#xD;
      disability in the management of AT. The second study was a process evaluation to gain insight&#xD;
      into the procedures undertaken in the feasibility study. Seven patients were interviewed to&#xD;
      discover what worked (and did not) from their perspective during the study. Based on the&#xD;
      results from the feasibility study and the information from the interviews with patients,&#xD;
      using this website is feasible, but the investigators have made some changes before proposing&#xD;
      this larger study. These changes include better promotion of the study, how verbal&#xD;
      recruitment strategies could be improved, and how communication between clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers could be made better. Based upon this knowledge this proposal aims to understand&#xD;
      if working alliance, patient outcome expectations and self-efficacy predict response to&#xD;
      treatment for AT.&#xD;

    <description>The LEFS is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical function of people with lower extremity dysfunctions, such as AT. Twenty items covering a range of lower extremity functional activities are scored on a numerical rating scale from zero (extreme difficulty or unable to perform activity) to four (no difficulty). This provides maximum scale points of eighty, with zero representing maximum dysfunction.</description>
