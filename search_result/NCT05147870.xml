  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in laparoscopic surgery for perforated peptic ulcer (PPU), intra-abdominal&#xD;
      abscess (IAA) is recognized as one of the commonly reported complications with relation to&#xD;
      the extent of infectious abdominal contamination. Herein, the investigators report their&#xD;
      experience of laparoscopic surgery for PPU with/without peritoneal irrigation and discuss&#xD;
      postoperative outcome. The investigators retrospectively examined the electronic medical&#xD;
      records of the patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for perforated peptic ulcer at a&#xD;
      single medical center in Taiwan between January 2013 and August 2021. Retrospectively, the&#xD;
      investigators would include those patients with clinical diagnosis of PPU who underwent&#xD;
      emergent laparoscopic surgery. The patients with previous abdominal surgery, pathologic&#xD;
      confirmed malignant ulcer perforation or concomitant ulcer bleeding were excluded. The&#xD;
      investigators focused on post-operative complications and outcome after laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      with or without peritoneal irrigation. This information can be important in improving&#xD;
      surgical options with respect to risk and potential benefits in this setting.&#xD;

    <description>In the suction only group, one surgical gauze each was placed in the splenophrenic space and Morison's pouch to soak up any remaining purulent fluid followed by turning the patient into the Trendelenburg position for inspection of the lower abdominal cavity. Any interloop adhesions were carefully divided and the gauze-wiping maneuver was used to soak up the residual peritoneal fluid, and all bowel loops were investigated to the root of the mesentery.</description>

        From October 2012 to February 2021, 688 patients presented to the emergency room with a&#xD;
        clinical diagnosis of PPU underwent surgery in our hospital. Five hundred and ninety-seven&#xD;
        patients were operated in an open approach including 21 patients who were given&#xD;
        laparoscopic surgery initially but then intraoperatively converted to laparotomy because&#xD;
        the large perforation site cannot be primarily repaired, or the perforation site was&#xD;
        difficult to identified or approached. The remaining 91 patients who underwent laparoscopic&#xD;
        repair were included in this study.&#xD;
