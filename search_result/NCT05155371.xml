    <textblock>
      Optimal intraoperative positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) improves the outcome. Optimal&#xD;
      PEEP is not only very different among individuals, but each individual's optimal PEEP is&#xD;
      affected by positioning, muscle paralysis, and several other factors. Several techniques have&#xD;
      been used to determine the optimal PEEP. For example, electrical impedance tomography(EIT)can&#xD;
      be performed at the bedside.However, the application of this technique requires special&#xD;
      training, increases the workload of the care team, and the cost-efficiencyof this procedure&#xD;
      remains to be determined.We hypothesized that optimal PEEP could be obtained by titration of&#xD;
      intraoperative PEEP levels and FiO2with SpO2 guidance. Our secondary hypothesis was that&#xD;
      maintenance of intraoperative optimal PEEP derived via this method improves intraoperative&#xD;
      oxygenation and reduces the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia.We tested our hypothesis in&#xD;
      patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.&#xD;

      Lung-protective ventilation strategies are recommended for patients under mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation with intermediate-risk and high-risk in order to minimize lung injury and&#xD;
      respiratory complications of critically ill patients associated with mechanical ventilation ,&#xD;
      such as atelectasis and pneumonia. Low tidal volume (TV) had been proven protective .&#xD;
      However, there is no consensus on what the optimal positive end expiatory pressure (PEEP) is&#xD;
      for patients with healthy lungs undergoing general anesthesia, particularly for those who are&#xD;
      undergoing abdominal surgery. A recent study showed that electrical impedance tomography&#xD;
      (EIT) could be used to identify optimal PEEP, where both lungs collapse, hyper-insufflation&#xD;
      is minimized, and the variation of optimal PEEP in patients with healthy lungs undergoing&#xD;
      abdominal surgery is profound.Therefore, a fixed PEEP applied to all patients surely&#xD;
      over-PEEP some and under-PEEP others. This study also demonstrates that maintaining the&#xD;
      optimal PEEP intra-operatively not only improves intra-operative oxygenation but also reduces&#xD;
      the incidence and severity of atelectasis post-operatively . Even though this study focuses&#xD;
      on the improvement of physiology rather than the outcome, the benefit of intra-operative&#xD;
      optimal PEEP is sustained for at least for one-hour post extubation. Therefore, optimized&#xD;
      intra-operative PEEP could potentially have a positive impact onoutcomes. However, the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of EIT used intraoperatively as routine practice still needs to be&#xD;
      determined. Development of new methods which can be used intraoperatively and&#xD;
      arecost-effective and user-friendly is an unmet demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Ferrando et al conducted a study in which the authors used minimal FiO2 to maintain&#xD;
      clinically acceptable arterial blood O2 saturation by titrating PEEP. Even though this study&#xD;
      was not randomized and sample size was insufficient to demonstrate improved outcomes, it&#xD;
      clearly demonstrated its feasibility and safety. We hypothesize that titration of&#xD;
      intraoperative PEEP using minimal FiO2 while maintaining clinically acceptable O2 saturation&#xD;
      allows clinicians to identify the optimal PEEP. We will test this hypothesis on patients&#xD;
      undegoing RALP. We chose this population because these patients have increased number of&#xD;
      postoperative complications . Additionally, physicians are prone to using suboptimal&#xD;
      ventilation strategies such as inappropriate tidal volumes and intraoperative PEEP in this&#xD;
      population; therefore these patients are more likely to achieve maximal benefit with&#xD;
      optimized intra-operative PEEP.&#xD;
