  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is crucial in the management of malignant melanoma&#xD;
      treatment and is currently performed by pre-operatively inject a colloid nanomaterial labeled&#xD;
      with Technetium (99mTc) as radioactive tracer. Intra-operatively, Patent Blue (PB) will be&#xD;
      injected to improve the visualization of the lymphatic tract. However, current pre-operative&#xD;
      SLN mapping technique is associated with disadvantages as radiation exposure for both&#xD;
      patients and health care staff and logistic challenges, because of time constraints due to&#xD;
      short half-live time of 99mTc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) is a non-radioactive technique using a magnetic tracer&#xD;
      (Magtrace® (Endomagnetics Ltd.)) to identify SLNs. Several studies showed that SPIO is&#xD;
      non-inferior to dual tracing with 99mTc and PB in breast cancer patients. SPIO is expected to&#xD;
      be non-inferior to dual tracing with 99mTc and PB in melanoma patients. However, further&#xD;
      research is needed to demonstrate the use of SPIO in pre-operative MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      pre-operative MRI scanning using SPIO compared to lymphoscintigraphy (LS) and single-photon&#xD;
      emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) using 99mTc for identifying SLN&#xD;
      status in melanoma patients.&#xD;

      Rationale: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is crucial in the management of malignant&#xD;
      melanoma treatment and is currently performed by pre-operatively inject a colloid&#xD;
      nanomaterial labeled with Technetium (99mTc) as radioactive tracer. Intra-operatively, Patent&#xD;
      Blue (PB) will be injected to improve the visualization of the lymphatic tract. However,&#xD;
      current pre-operative SLN mapping technique is associated with disadvantages as radiation&#xD;
      exposure for both patients and health care staff and logistic challenges, because of time&#xD;
      constraints due to short half-live time of 99mTc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) is a non-radioactive technique using a magnetic tracer&#xD;
      (Magtrace® (Endomagnetics Ltd.)) to identify SLNs. Several studies showed that SPIO is&#xD;
      non-inferior to dual tracing with 99mTc and PB in breast cancer patients. SPIO is expected to&#xD;
      be non-inferior to dual tracing with 99mTc and PB in melanoma patients. However, further&#xD;
      research is needed to demonstrate the use of SPIO in pre-operative MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of pre-operative MRI scanning using SPIO compared to lymphoscintigraphy (LS) and&#xD;
      single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) using 99mTc for&#xD;
      identifying SLN status in melanoma patients. A secondary objective is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of SPIO/magnetometer (Sentimag®, Endomagnetics Ltd.) in&#xD;
      comparison with dual trace gold standard (99mTc and PB) in SLN procedures in melanoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A prospective single-arm feasibility study will be performed at the department&#xD;
      of Surgical oncology at Zuyderland Medical Center Sittard, the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients (≥18 years) with primary melanoma stage I-II and an&#xD;
      indication for wide local excision (1 cm) and SLN procedure will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): All patients will undergo lymphatic mapping with a SPIO tracer&#xD;
      (Magtrace®), 99mTc and PB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The concordance in SLN detection rate (sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of SPIO/MRI and LS and SPECT/CT using 99mTc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concordance in SLN detection rate (sensitivity and specificity) of SPIO/magnetometer and&#xD;
      the gold standard dual trace technique using 99mTc/Gamma probe and PB. Additionally, the&#xD;
      number of post-injection (skin) reactions, complication and adverse events will be noted.&#xD;
