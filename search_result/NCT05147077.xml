  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke anxiety (PSA) is a common complication of stroke that leads to dysfunction and&#xD;
      reduces the quality of life. PSA exacerbates cognitive dysfunction, delays the recovery&#xD;
      process, and increases the disability, mortality, and recurrence rates of stroke. Therefore,&#xD;
      early clinical treatments for PSA are important to improve the prognosis and restore the&#xD;
      social functions of stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated rehabilitation has significant advantages in the treatment of PSA. First of all,&#xD;
      there is a wide range of rehabilitation methods, such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which have been proved to be&#xD;
      effective for PSA. However, as the application of integrated rehabilitation becomes more and&#xD;
      more widespread, its shortcomings are gradually emerging. For example, most of the treatment&#xD;
      protocols used in clinical studies are based on personal experience of the investigators, a&#xD;
      unified protocol has not yet been formed, treatment methods are still insufficient in&#xD;
      standardization and reproducibility. More studies focus solely on the improvement of a&#xD;
      certain symptom by a certain rehabilitation therapy, but ignore the important theoretical&#xD;
      basis of the &quot;holistic concept&quot;, thus showing the uneven clinical efficacy. For the above&#xD;
      existing problems, it is necessary to conduct original and innovative research.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled trial will enroll 188 PSA patients from the Third Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Zhejiang General Hospital of Armed Police,&#xD;
      Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, and Jinhua Second&#xD;
      Hospital. All patients will be randomly assigned to either the integrated rehabilitation&#xD;
      group or the standard care group through a randomization system. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      assessed by hamilton anxiety (HAMA) scale, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and activity of&#xD;
      daily living (ADL) scale. Secondary outcomes will include montreal cognitive assessment&#xD;
      (MoCA) scale, the simple fugl-meyer assessment of motor function (FMA) scale and pittsburgh&#xD;
      sleep quality index (PSQI).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hamilton anxiety (HAMA) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 4-week during treatment, at 8-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-rating anxiety scale (SAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 4-week during treatment, at 8-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) is a method of measuring levels of anxiety in patients who have anxiety-related symptoms. The scale focuses on the most common general anxiety disorders; coping with stress typically causes anxiety.&#xD;
The SAS test is self-administered, with each response using a 4-point scale, from 'none of the time&quot; to &quot;most of the time.&quot; There are 20 questions with 15 increasing anxiety level questions and 5 decreasing anxiety questions. There are two formats, self-evaluations and clinical evaluations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in activity of daily living (ADL) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 4-week during treatment, at 8-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities of Daily Living are a series of basic activities necessary for independent living at home or in the community. They are performed on a daily basis. There are many variations on the definition of the ADLs, but most organizations agree there are 5 basic categories.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 4-week during treatment, at-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment scoring is based on a 30-point scale, with points awarded differently depending on the type of question asked. For instance, you can earn one point for each animal you identify in a picture, but listing the names of 13 fruits in under a minute gains you only two points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the simple fugl-meyer assessment of motor function (FMA) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 4-week during treatment, at-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring is based on direct observation of performance. Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale where 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully. The total possible scale score is 226.&#xD;
Points are divided among the domains as follows:&#xD;
Motor score: ranges from 0 (hemiplegia) to 100 points (normal motor performance). Divided into 66 points for upper extremity and 34 points for the lower extremity.&#xD;
Sensation: ranges from 0 to 24 points. Divided into 8 points for light touch and 16 points for position sense.&#xD;
Balance: ranges from 0 to 14 points. Divided into 6 points for sitting and 8 points for standing.&#xD;
Joint range of motion: ranges from 0 to 44 points. Joint pain: ranges from 0 to 44 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 4-week during treatment, at-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The range of values for questions 5 through 10 are all 0 to 3. Questions 1 through 9 are not allowed to be missing except as noted below. If these questions are missing then any scores calculated using missing questions are also missing. Thus it is important to make sure that all questions 1 through 9 have been answered.&#xD;
In the event that a range is given for an answer (for example, '30 to 60' is written as the answer to Q2, minutes to fall asleep), split the difference and enter 45.</description>
