    <textblock>
      Rift Valley fever (RVF), a disease transmitted from livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, camels)&#xD;
      to humans more commonly occurs in the East and Central Africa (ECA) regions where more than&#xD;
      15 major epidemics affecting more than one country have been reported over the past 50 years.&#xD;
      Within the region, there are specific areas, referred to as hotspots, which support RVF virus&#xD;
      maintenance via low-level virus circulation between animals, humans, and mosquitoes. Most&#xD;
      outbreaks originate from these hotspots. Our goal is to conduct studies in RVF hotspots in&#xD;
      four ECA countries, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to&#xD;
      determine the burden of RVF disease among humans, wildlife and livestock during&#xD;
      inter-epidemic periods (IEPs) and discover circulation of undetected infectious diseases.&#xD;
      This information is important for use in developing an early warning system and possibly a&#xD;
      vaccination strategy. The study will take place in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Democratic&#xD;
      Republic of Congo&#xD;

      STUDY BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The East and Central Africa (ECA) region represents a unique environment to investigate RVF&#xD;
      virus maintenance and transmission as it has reported the largest number of RVF epidemics.&#xD;
      Recent studies have identified hotspots characterized by continuous low levels of human and&#xD;
      livestock virus infections during the inter-epidemic periods (IEPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although sheep are at highest risk of severe disease, how virus-host interactions differ&#xD;
      between animal species is an area for further research. Seroprevalence and incidence studies&#xD;
      at the wildlife, livestock, human interface are also important in understanding the nature of&#xD;
      cross-species transmission. Our study will investigate the public health threat posed by RVFV&#xD;
      during IEPs by determining the burden of human and livestock diseases, and the degree of&#xD;
      sustained viral transmission in animal species during cryptic cycles. This will be carried&#xD;
      out through surveillance among humans, livestock and wildlife. Understanding virus&#xD;
      maintenance especially within the environment, vectors and wildlife populations will aid in&#xD;
      identifying potential risk factors for RVFV infection in order to prevent future outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While disease occurrence among animals may frequently go unnoticed due to inadequate animal&#xD;
      surveillance systems and low levels of animal abortion, human disease may be the first&#xD;
      indication that RVF virus amplification is occurring at high levels in a particular region .&#xD;
      Furthermore, understanding the social aspects of disease transmission through human studies&#xD;
      exploring human behaviour and cultural practices that lead to direct exposure to infected&#xD;
      animal blood, tissues, secretions and excretions could provide valuable information to&#xD;
      disease spill over dynamics . Additional knowledge of how routes for human exposure e.g.&#xD;
      through mosquito bites or contact with infected animal products affect the immune response&#xD;
      and disease outcomes is required . This will enhance global efforts in preparing for, and&#xD;
      preventing, the possible spread of RVF disease to new regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While RVF may be an under-diagnosed cause of febrile illness within the ECA region it is&#xD;
      important to consider the occurrence of other unknown or undiagnosed infectious diseases.&#xD;
      Serious clinical disease due to a variety of pathogens in humans or animals is most likely&#xD;
      missed in settings where health care access is limited and diagnostics scarce. Notably,&#xD;
      multiple studies from the region report low levels of hospital visits, particularly among&#xD;
      marginalized communities, including those in remote rural arid lands that have few health&#xD;
      facilities and poorly functioning transport infrastructure that discourages traveling long&#xD;
      distances to access health care. Over a third of suspected infectious diseases among humans&#xD;
      go undiagnosed even when considerable testing is carried out; thus, many retrospective&#xD;
      studies of emerging pathogens uncover cases in the region that occurred long before the&#xD;
      pathogen was identified and epidemics reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Goal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our working hypothesis is that RVF virus, maintained through cryptic vertebrate-mosquito&#xD;
      cycling during inter-epidemic periods is a substantial public health burden. The overall goal&#xD;
      is to determine the public health threat posed by RVF virus during IEPs in East and Central&#xD;
      Africa region and identify potential opportunities for prevention and control strategies to&#xD;
      reduce the likelihood of major outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Determine whether low-level RVF virus transmission and disease among or between animals&#xD;
      and humans occurs during the inter-epidemic periods (IEPs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Conduct detailed niche modelling of RVF high risk and low risk ecologies to determine&#xD;
      the important ecological risk factors associated with persistence of RVF virus and recurrence&#xD;
      of outbreaks in animals and humans&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Investigate impact of climate change on the RVF permissive ecologies and its effect on&#xD;
      RVF virus transmission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Conduct pathogen discovery on human, livestock, and wildlife samples collected from ECA&#xD;
      countries to identify other circulating emerging infectious pathogens which are of epidemic&#xD;
      or pandemic potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct the field studies in four countries as listed below, but with the&#xD;
      understanding that other emerging RVF hotspots in the region could be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Tana river, Marsabit, Isiolo and Murangá counties in Kenya (ii) Kabale, Rubanda and&#xD;
      Isingiro districts in Uganda (iii) North and South Kivu provinces in DRC (iv) Any other site&#xD;
      in the 4 countries emerging as a RVF hotspot or site of&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In and outpatient health facility-based studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will conduct a 2-year hospital-based study at each site to determine the burden of&#xD;
           RVF infections in humans, risk factors associated with infection, and severity of&#xD;
           disease during IEPs. A sample size of 707-1,500 human participants will be recruited&#xD;
           over the 2 years at each site, based on assumptions of RVFV seroprevalence. At each&#xD;
           health facility, longitudinal acute febrile illness (AFI) surveillance will be&#xD;
           established. Patients, both adults and children presenting with acute fever or reported&#xD;
           fever in the last 4 weeks, will be included prospectively over a period of two years in&#xD;
           order to capture seasonal variability. We will focus on cases of undifferentiated fever,&#xD;
           hence those with a clearly defined clinical disease, for example, malaria, an acute&#xD;
           upper respiratory tract infection or urinary tract infection will be excluded. However,&#xD;
           twenty percent of samples from patients who test positive for malaria by rapid&#xD;
           diagnostic test or blood smear will be included in the study as there are common risk&#xD;
           factors for both malaria and RVF infection. A clinical history and physical examination&#xD;
           by a clinical officer/nurse on-ground will provide information on clinical manifestation&#xD;
           and severity of illness. Consenting patients will be enrolled, serum collected and&#xD;
           tested for RVFV RNA, and IgM and IgG antibodies. Convalescent serum will be collected 4&#xD;
           weeks after the date of enrolment for RVFV antibodies. In addition, the individual may&#xD;
           be contacted to provide blood specimen up to 24 months after enrolment for analysis of&#xD;
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The specimens will also be tested for other&#xD;
           etiology for acute febrile illness including brucellosis, q-fever, coronaviruses and&#xD;
           potentially other novel and emerging pathogens by molecular methods. Using a standard&#xD;
           questionnaire, we will collect information on contact with domestic animals including&#xD;
           assisting with birth, slaughter, handling hides and skins, and consuming raw milk or&#xD;
           blood. Data on contact with wildlife including eating bush meat will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Community studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine burden of disease in livestock, 2 - 6 cross-sectional surveys at each site&#xD;
           will be conducted over 5 years, primarily during rainy seasons. The livestock sample&#xD;
           size, assuming an average RVF seroprevalence of 4%, precision of 2%, confidence level of&#xD;
           95%, and power of at least 80% is 369 animals per survey. To account for herd&#xD;
           clustering, a design effect of 1.5 is included for a total of 554 animals per site for&#xD;
           each survey. The number of cattle, sheep, goats will be selected proportionate to animal&#xD;
           species population size in the area. Where no animal census records are available in an&#xD;
           area the number of animals per species will be divided equally (approx. 185 animals of&#xD;
           each species). At the Marsabit site, camels will be included. At the start of the&#xD;
           survey, we will develop a sampling frame of the number of households in the study site.&#xD;
           To provide a geographically representative sample, households will be randomly selected&#xD;
           from the study site. The breed of animal whether exotic or indigenous will be captured.&#xD;
           Livestock blood samples will be collected and tested for RVFV RNA, and anti-viral IgM&#xD;
           and IgG antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The household members of the selected field sites will be included in a seroprevalence&#xD;
           (and sero-conversion) study, to be able to link animal, vector and human infection. All&#xD;
           consented household members will be included. Each participant will provide a sample for&#xD;
           serological analysis and social behaviour will be assessed, using the standard&#xD;
           questionnaire - to collect information on contact with domestic animals including&#xD;
           assisting with birth, slaughter, handling hides and skins, and consuming raw milk or&#xD;
           blood. Data on contact with wildlife including eating bush meat will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Slaugther house studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sampling of cattle and goats will also be performed at slaughter houses in Goma. Most of&#xD;
           these animals originate from neighbouring countries. Sheep that are rarely slaughtered&#xD;
           at Goma will also be sampled when available. Slaughter house sampling will be conducted&#xD;
           at the same occasion with livestock sampling. All the samples analysed using serological&#xD;
           and molecular techniques for the detection of anti-RVFV antibodies and RVFV nucleic&#xD;
           acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Wildlife sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Convenient wildlife sampling will be carried out in the field sites or nearby national&#xD;
           conservation areas in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and DRC. Primarily blood/serum samples&#xD;
           collected by wildlife officers during animal disease surveillance and/or translocation;&#xD;
           and blood/serum and tissue samples from dead or killed wildlife will be collected. We&#xD;
           will also obtain archived samples from these locations. The samples will be tested for&#xD;
           RVF RNA and antibodies, and for pathogen discovery to detect other circulating emerging&#xD;
           pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Vector studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our approach to investigating the role of vectors in cryptic cycles during IEPs will be&#xD;
           guided by the fact that only a small proportion of mosquitoes are normally infected,&#xD;
           even during epidemics. Therefore, to identify which areas to test for presence of&#xD;
           infected mosquitoes we will interpret acute RVFV infections (presence of viral RNA) as a&#xD;
           measure of presence of infected mosquitoes and mosquito-to-vertebrate transmission. In&#xD;
           these areas with acute RVFV infection we will collect and test mosquito pools in the&#xD;
           community grazing areas and households during livestock sampling, identify the species&#xD;
           and test for RVFV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since it is difficult to establish colonies of the known RVF vectors, Aedes mcintoshi&#xD;
           and Aedes ochraceus, for laboratory studies, we will carry out suitability studies in&#xD;
           the field using two approaches. First, eggs and larvae of mosquitoes will be collected&#xD;
           during the long (April - July) and short (October - November) rains from dambos located&#xD;
           at low elevation in all five field sites in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and DRC and&#xD;
           geocodes recorded in areas around the study site that have solonetz, planosol,&#xD;
           solonchak, or vertisol soil types. Larvae in 3rd, 4th stages and pupae will be collected&#xD;
           using dippers into plastic whirl-pack bags for transportation (in cool boxes) to the&#xD;
           laboratory. Once in the laboratory, the immatures will be reared to adults and then&#xD;
           identified morphologically. Adult mosquitoes around dambo habitats will be sampled using&#xD;
           odour-baited traps including collections of those resting on vegetation using backpack&#xD;
           aspirators for eventual transport and sorting according to site and species. The&#xD;
           physico-chemical properties of water from selected dambos will be determined and the&#xD;
           soil types identified. Water from each of the dambos will be subject to headspace&#xD;
           volatile trapping and chemical analyses to identify potential oviposition cues for&#xD;
           eventual development of tools for monitoring gravid mosquito cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For vector adaptation studies, A. mcintoshi and A. ochraceous mosquitoes collected from&#xD;
           the five field sites will be subjected to the expected temperatures and rainfall/water&#xD;
           conditions and their adaptability assessed. Assessment of adaptability will include&#xD;
           observations of overall survival, egg survival, changes in biting habits, feeding&#xD;
           preferences and resting behaviour within a controlled environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. RVF modelling studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Modelling studies support RVFV transmission during IEPs in areas associated with RVF&#xD;
           epidemics. The studies predict that the continuous cycling of RVFV is powered by&#xD;
           presence of mosquito vectors throughout the year (but varying densities), and rapid&#xD;
           turnover of livestock populations, particularly sheep, goats, and cattle to sustain the&#xD;
           high herd susceptibility required for new infections. We will use mathematical modelling&#xD;
           to predict the timelines and locations of major RVF human and domestic animal epidemics;&#xD;
           these data will in turn guide prevention and control efforts. We will investigate why&#xD;
           there are areas with RVF circulation but no apparent human infections considering that&#xD;
           some of these areas are adjacent to areas where epidemics occur. This is important since&#xD;
           it is possible that RVFV circulating at low levels has the potential for causing human&#xD;
           epidemics during El Nino events. Human, livestock, and vector data from all field sites&#xD;
           conducting RVFV transmission studies will be fed into the model. Model parameters will&#xD;
           be optimized by fitting simulations to field observations (e.g. the seroprevalence data&#xD;
           in humans or livestock) using Bayesian inference techniques (e.g. MCMC and POMP models).&#xD;
           Comparative analysis of all study sites will help elucidate the factors associated with&#xD;
           RVFV transmission and emergence. The model will factor data from areas associated with&#xD;
           RVFV epidemics (e.g. Tana river in Kenya and Kabale district in Uganda), and areas where&#xD;
           virus circulation is evident but no epidemics have occurred (e.g. Udzungwa Mountains in&#xD;
           Tanzania) in order to understand differences in transmission dynamics. These data may&#xD;
           give new insights on the epidemic risk. Comparative analysis will look into the&#xD;
           spatio-temporal heterogeneity of transmission in the four countries. Other important&#xD;
           data to be collected from our field studies and published literature include vector&#xD;
           species/vector density/vector RVFV positivity, animal presence/animal density/animal&#xD;
           RVFV positivity, human-animal contact, population density/population positivity,&#xD;
           spectrum of disease presentation and severity, co-circulation of other arboviruses, and&#xD;
           genetic characterization of RVFV in various areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Testing of archived samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach will be utilised in DRC using samples collected from the following studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A: A cross-sectional study including outpatient acute febrile syndromes in both&#xD;
      children and adults, between November 2015 and June 2016 in Kinshasa, DRC: 342 patients, aged&#xD;
      2 to 68 years, were included. The study was registered in a public repository&#xD;
      (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02656862); and funded under framework agreement&#xD;
      between the Institute of Tropical Medicine and the Belgian development cooperation and&#xD;
      Vlaamse Interuniversitaire Raad - Universitaire Ontwikkelingssamenwerking (VLIR-UOS, Grant&#xD;
      reference ZRDC2014MP083). These sampes will be analysed using serological and molecular&#xD;
      techniques for the detection of anti-RVF antibodies or RVFV nucleic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: Archived samples were collected from cattle and goats in Goma abattoirs, and in&#xD;
      cattle farms in the North-Kivu province in 2017. Some of these animals originated from&#xD;
      neighboring countries and provide useful materials to assess the risk of RVFV circulation in&#xD;
      the region. Serological and molecular techniques will be used for the detection of anti-RVF&#xD;
      antibodies and RVFV nucleic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study C: Archived samples collected from wild animals in Virunga Park and kept at the&#xD;
      Veterinary Laboratory in Goma will be screened for the presence of anti-RVF antibodies and&#xD;
      RVFV nucleic acid. Most of these samples originated from non-human primates raised in close&#xD;
      contact with the local population. Such samples will provide useful information on the&#xD;
      circulation of the RVF at the interface wild animal - human interface within the game park.&#xD;
