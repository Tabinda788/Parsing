  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of two control intervals (once every 4th week or once every 6th week)&#xD;
      on the wear time of a Twin Block removable appliance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the patient fulfill the inclusion criteria, they will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
      study. After being informed about the study and the planned treatment, participants and their&#xD;
      guardians will give their written consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therafter they will be consecutively randomized into one of two groups with different control&#xD;
      intervals, Group 1 (every 4th week) and Group 2 (every 6th week). They will recieve a&#xD;
      clinical and radiological examination and then start treatment with a Twin Block appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Twin Block appliance will be fitted with a digital timer module to measure the wear time&#xD;
      of the appliance objectively.&#xD;

    <measure>Wear time of the Twin Block appliance, compared between participants randomized into two groups with different check up intervals</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 12 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To measure if the wear time of the Twin Block appliance would increase if the control interval increased from once every 6th week to once every 4th week. The wear time was registered using the TheraMon system, and was measured in hours per day.</description>

    <measure>Reduction in overjet, compared between participants randomized into two groups with different check up intervals</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to treatment completion, up to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>To see if reduction in overjet would differ between or within the groups before and after treatment was finished. Horizontal overjet was measured in millimetres on study casts before and after treatment was finished.</description>
