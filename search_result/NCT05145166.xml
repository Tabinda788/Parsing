      This study of live attenuated mumps vaccines is an observational study in which active&#xD;
      monitoring and passive monitoring were combined to conduct safety observation.The live&#xD;
      attenuated mumps vaccines manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of live attenuated mumps vaccines after&#xD;
      large-scale application and accumulate safety data for the application of live attenuated&#xD;
      mumps vaccines,and provide scientific basis for the formulation of vaccine immunization&#xD;
      prevention strategies.&#xD;

      This study of live attenuated mumps vaccines is an observational study in which active&#xD;
      monitoring and passive monitoring were combined to conduct safety observation.The live&#xD;
      attenuated mumps vaccines manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co.,&#xD;
      Ltd.Bao'ji, Xian'yang, Yan 'an and Han'zhong of Shaanxi Province were selected as the&#xD;
      research center.A total of 10000 junior high school students under 14 years old who&#xD;
      voluntarily received a dose of live attenuated mumps vaccines were be enrolled.Adverse&#xD;
      reactions/events at 30 minutes, 14 days and 30 days after vaccination of live attenuated&#xD;
      mumps vaccine were were collected by face-to-face or telephone follow-up.&#xD;
