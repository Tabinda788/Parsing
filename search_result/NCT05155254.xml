  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 3, multicenter, international, open-label, randomized, 2-arm trial investigating the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment&#xD;
      for patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified on the basis of the following factors; Disease stage:&#xD;
      Unresectable stage IIID or stage IV M1a-b versus stage IV M1c-d and BRAFV600 mutation status:&#xD;
      mutated vs wild type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of&#xD;
      35 cycles corresponding to around 2 years of treatment. Patients randomized to IO102-IO103&#xD;
      dual-antigen, immunotherapeutic arm will also be given IO102-IO103 Q3W with an additional&#xD;
      dose given during the induction period on Day 8 of cycles 1 and 2. IO102 IO103 will&#xD;
      thereafter be administered subcutaneous every 3 weeks during the maintenance period. Each&#xD;
      patient can be treated for a maximum of 37 administrations in total, corresponding to around&#xD;
      2 years of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to investigate the efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (compared with pembrolizumab alone) in terms of progression free survival.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage III (unresectable) or stage IV&#xD;
             melanoma, as per American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition guidelines not&#xD;
             amenable to local therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients are treatment naive, that is, no previous systemic anticancer therapy for&#xD;
             unresectable or metastatic melanoma. For clarification, the following patients are&#xD;
             eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAFV600) mutation-positive melanoma are&#xD;
                  eligible if treatment naive and without rapidly progressive disease as per&#xD;
                  investigator assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients who have received previous adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapy with&#xD;
                  targeted therapy or immune therapy are eligible if administered the last dose at&#xD;
                  least 6 months before inclusion in this trial (randomization), and if relapse did&#xD;
                  not occur during active treatment or within 6 months of treatment&#xD;
                  discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 1 measurable lesion (not a cutaneous lesion) according to response evaluation&#xD;
             criteria for solid tumors (RECIST v1.1) and confirmed by IRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Provision of archival (obtained within 3 months), or newly acquired biopsy tissue not&#xD;
             previously irradiated, and blood at screening for biomarker assessments.&#xD;
             Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly&#xD;
             obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) metastases or with the&#xD;
             CNS as the only site of active disease are excluded with the following exception:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Patients with controlled (stable) brain metastases will be allowed to enroll&#xD;
             (subject to baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmation). Controlled&#xD;
             (stable) brain metastases are defined as those with no radiographic progression for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks after radiation and/or surgical treatment at the time of signed informed&#xD;
             consent. Patients must have been off steroids for at least 2 weeks before signed&#xD;
             informed consent and have no new or progressive neurological signs and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has received previous radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of trial treatment&#xD;
             (visit 2). Patients must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not&#xD;
             require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is&#xD;
             permitted for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with BRAFV600-positive disease who are experiencing rapidly progressing&#xD;
             disease and/or have received standard first-line therapy with BRAF and/or MEK&#xD;
             inhibitor for unresectable or metastatic disease.&#xD;
