  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia, causing microvascular&#xD;
      and macrovascular complications. The latter lead to various disabilities: blindness,&#xD;
      end-stage renal failure, nerve damage, formation of leg ulcers, and atherosclerosis. In&#xD;
      people with type 2 diabetes, the probability of these atherosclerosis associated&#xD;
      complications is twice as high as in people without diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are&#xD;
      also the main cause of mortality in people with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventive measures are therefore crucial. In people with type 2 diabetes, in addition to&#xD;
      good glycaemic control, the choice of antidiabetic drugs is also important. Large-scale&#xD;
      research has shown that certain glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonists, in addition&#xD;
      to improving the regulation of diabetes, also have a significant effect on reducing the&#xD;
      macrovascular complications. It is now possible to use semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist,&#xD;
      in the tablet form. Semaglutide lowers blood sugar only when the blood sugar value rises, due&#xD;
      to food in the digestive tract, Thus, not increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. In addition,&#xD;
      semaglutide has a significant effect on weight loss and very beneficial, protective effects&#xD;
      on the cardiovascular system. Large studies have shown that in its injectable form, it&#xD;
      significantly reduces the incidence of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to examine how semaglutide provides protective&#xD;
      effects on the cardiovascular system and reduces the risk of diabetes type 2 associated&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will include 100 people with type 2 diabetes and last for 12 months. The&#xD;
      subjects will receive a semaglutide oral tablet daily in addition to their current treatment&#xD;
      (combination of metformin and a sulphonyl urea). At the beginning of the study, after 6&#xD;
      months and at the end of the study (after 12 months of treatment), a detailed clinical&#xD;
      examination will be performed and blood will be taken for laboratory parameters. In addition&#xD;
      to basic blood tests, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, as well as lipid&#xD;
      fractions parameters will also be assessed. Ultrasound examination of the changes in the&#xD;
      carotid arteries and measures of additional properties of the arteries will also be&#xD;
      performed. The confidentiality of the data of the participants in the research will be&#xD;
      ensured, as the data obtained during the investigation will be encrypted before processing.&#xD;
