  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators developed a brief standardized internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral program&#xD;
      for treating anxious and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents in the context of&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil. A 2-arm parallel-randomized controlled clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted to test the efficacy of this program (intervention group), in comparison with a&#xD;
      educational-only intervention program based on videos (active control group). 280 children&#xD;
      and adolescents (8 to 17 years-old) with clinically significant anxious and/or depressive&#xD;
      symptoms will be recruited through internet and social media. They will be randomized either&#xD;
      to the intervention (n=140) or active control group (n=140). Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from across the country. The therapeutic program consists of 5 weekly sessions covering the&#xD;
      following contents: education on stress reactions, family communication, relaxation and&#xD;
      mindful techniques, emotion recognition, management of irritability, behavioral activation,&#xD;
      and cognitive restructuring. The educational program consists of 15 videos covering the same&#xD;
      content. Participants in the intervention group will also have access to these videos. Both&#xD;
      child/adolescent and at least one caregiver will be required to take part in the sessions&#xD;
      (and watch the videos). Participants will be assessed at the beginning (baseline; T0) at the&#xD;
      end (endpoint; T1), and 30 days after the intervention (follow-up; T2) with standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires, through an interview with a blinded investigator. Participants that develop&#xD;
      severe symptomatology requiring further support during the intervention (such as psychiatric&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment and/or more intensive psychotherapy) will be referred to adequate&#xD;
      treatment. During the week prior to the intervention and the first week after its end,&#xD;
      adolescents (older than 12 years-old) in both groups with access to a smartphone will be&#xD;
      asked to report their momentary mood, emotions, and stress several times a day using the same&#xD;
      smartphone app that will deliver the educational content to both groups. Adolescents will&#xD;
      also be asked to install a second smartphone application that captures data from the phone&#xD;
      sensors to provide proxies on behaviors associated with depression, such as social isolation&#xD;
      (by the proximity with other devices, time spent on social media, as well as environmental&#xD;
      sound and light) amount of inactivity (by assessing the maximum distance traveled throughout&#xD;
      the day), among others.&#xD;

      Investigators developed a brief standardized and manualized internet-delivered&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral (iCBT) program for treating anxious and depressive symptoms in children&#xD;
      and adolescents in the context of COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil, to be implemented by trained&#xD;
      psychologists. A 2-arm parallel-randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted&#xD;
      to test the efficacy of this program (intervention group), in comparison with a&#xD;
      educational-only intervention program based on videos (active control group). 280 children&#xD;
      and adolescents (8 to 17 years-old) with clinically significant anxious and/or depressive&#xD;
      symptoms (total t-score of 70 or above in the 25-item version of the Revised Children's&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale - parent report) will be recruited through internet and social&#xD;
      media. They will be randomized either to the intervention (n=140) or active control group&#xD;
      (n=140). Since all interventions will be conducted online, participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from across the country. The therapeutic program consists of 5 weekly sessions delivered to&#xD;
      children or adolescents and their parents and covering the following contents: education on&#xD;
      stress reactions, family communication, relaxation and mindful techniques, emotion&#xD;
      recognition, management of irritability, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring.&#xD;
      All sessions will be recorded and 10% of them will be randomly selected to be watched by one&#xD;
      of the authors of the psychotherapeutic program to assess protocol adherence. The educational&#xD;
      program consists of 15 videos covering the same content. Participants in the intervention&#xD;
      group will also have access to these videos. Both child/adolescent and at least one caregiver&#xD;
      will be required to take part in the sessions (and watch the videos). Participants in both&#xD;
      groups will be assessed at the beginning (baseline; T0) at the end (endpoint; T1), and 30&#xD;
      days after the intervention (follow-up; T2) with standardized questionnaires, through an&#xD;
      interview with a blinded investigator at T0, T1, and T2. Participants that develop severe&#xD;
      symptomatology requiring further support during the intervention (such as psychiatric&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment and/or more intensive psychotherapy) will be referred to adequate&#xD;
      treatment. During the week prior to the intervention and the first week after its end,&#xD;
      adolescents (older than 12 years-old) in both groups who have access to a smartphone will be&#xD;
      asked to report their momentary mood, emotions, and stress several times a day using the same&#xD;
      smartphone app that will deliver the educational content to both groups. Adolescents will&#xD;
      also be asked to install a second smartphone application that captures data from the phone&#xD;
      sensors to provide proxies on behaviors associated with depression, such as social isolation&#xD;
      (by the proximity with other devices, time spent on social media, as well as environmental&#xD;
      sound and light) amount of inactivity (by assessing the maximum distance traveled throughout&#xD;
      the day), among others.&#xD;

This Experience Sampling Method (ESM) schedule consists of 17 questions, taking up to 3min to complete. The ESM schedule will be delivered four random times per day within four three-hour blocks from 9:00 to 21:00 for six consecutive days in the week prior to the beginning of the intervention (first session, in the Intervention Group, and the availability of the first video, in the Active Control Group) and the week after the end of it (therefore, pre and post intervention).</description>
