  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral vasospasm is characterized by a vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries causing a&#xD;
      reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and leading to ischemia and infarction of the brain&#xD;
      parenchyma. Cerebral vasospasm is a serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage (SAH) with high morbidity and overall mortality of 40-50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanisms of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on the innervation of cerebral&#xD;
      vessels are still unclear, several hypotheses have been formulated and studies in animals and&#xD;
      human performed with very promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a proof of concept study to better understand the effect and mechanisms of cervical&#xD;
      spinal cord stimulation on cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH in human.&#xD;

      Cerebral vasospasm is characterized by a vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries causing a&#xD;
      reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and leading to ischemia and infarction of the brain&#xD;
      parenchyma. Cerebral vasospasm is a serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage (SAH) with high morbidity and overall mortality of 40-50%. The exact&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cerebral vasospasm are still not known in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide range of different therapeutic options with various efficacies are available, triple-H&#xD;
      therapy and endovascular treatment options like intra-arterial application of vasodilators&#xD;
      e.g. Nimodipine or Papaverine or transluminal balloon angioplasty have been reported and are&#xD;
      applied to prevent and treat cerebral vasospasm after SAH. Calcium channel blockers such as&#xD;
      nimodipine or nicardipine improve outcome in patients after SAH and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      secondary ischemia. The benefit of the different therapies is undoubted, but there is still&#xD;
      potential for improvement concerning the rate of morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanisms of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on the innervation of cerebral&#xD;
      vessels are still unclear, several hypotheses have been formulated and studies in animals and&#xD;
      human performed with very promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a proof of concept study to better understand the effect and mechanisms of cervical&#xD;
      spinal cord stimulation on cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are enrolled into the study, if radiographical vasospasms are detected in CTA, CTP,&#xD;
      cerebral angiography or TCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCS leads are implanted within 12h after study enrolment following the investigator's&#xD;
      standard practice. SCS will be continuously delivered until day 14 after SAH. Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound is performed before SCS lead implantation and repeated after implantation on a&#xD;
      daily basis and appearance of a new neurological deficit device until 24h after stopping the&#xD;
      stimulation. Efficacy of cervical SCS is further evaluated by CTA or angiography and CTA/P&#xD;
      performed 48h and 96h after lead implantation, as well as on day 14 after SAH before stopping&#xD;
      the stimulation. The SCS electrode(s) are explanted on day15. Intracerebral pressure is&#xD;
      monitored from day 7-15. Headache, measured as NRS0-10 and the consumption of analgesics are&#xD;
      monitored from day 7-15, at discharge, at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
