  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to measure the effects of obturator nerve cryoneurotomy, on&#xD;
      clinical measures in adult (ages 19+) and paediatric (ages 12-18) patients with hip adductor&#xD;
      spasticity, who will receive this procedure as a part of their treatment based on the&#xD;
      spasticity treatment available guidelines. The results will provide us valuable information&#xD;
      like how long cryoneurotomy is effective, before regeneration happens&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip adductor spasticity is a common affliction amongst patients with disorders of the central&#xD;
      nervous system. Spasticity affects as much as 60% of people with cerebral palsy, and up to&#xD;
      97% of patients with MS. Spasticity can be detrimental to gait, leading to lowered walking&#xD;
      velocity, lack of stability and more frequent falls in conditions of the central nervous&#xD;
      system, like cerebral palsy . Hip adductor spasticity can make it difficult for one to part&#xD;
      their knees sufficiently to perform personal hygiene and can lead to extreme difficulties&#xD;
      dressing and performing other activities of daily living. A lack of ability to perform&#xD;
      activities of daily living leads to lessened independence. In this study, we will measure the&#xD;
      efficacy of obturator cryoneurotomy for patients with spastic hip adduction as an alternative&#xD;
      approach to more invasive, complicated and costly treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project constitutes a single-centre, prospective cohort study. Data collection will&#xD;
      occur at the Victoria General Hospital (VGH) multidisciplinary spasticity clinic, consisting&#xD;
      of physiatrists, an orthopedic surgeon and physiotherapists. Patients with spasticity are&#xD;
      referred to this clinic for different procedures including cryoneurotomy. This&#xD;
      multidisciplinary spasticity clinic offers various treatments to spastic patients, including&#xD;
      botulinum toxin injection, bracing, consultations for surgery or neurotomy. All procedures&#xD;
      are offered to each patient. Most of the patients in the study will have already had Botox&#xD;
      and bracing, or even neurotomy. As of yet all patients have had botulinum injections and&#xD;
      bracing before cryoneurotomy. This study will not interfere or change the patients' medical&#xD;
      care, and we will do the assessments for the patients who are already candidates for this&#xD;
      procedure as a part of their treatment, besides other provided medical cares and have been&#xD;
      accepted to receive that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are already candidates for cryoneurotomy as a part of their treatment, will be&#xD;
      invited to have an extra ten-meter walk test. All measures are part of the standard clinical&#xD;
      assessment, except the 10 meter-walk test. The spasticity degree and range of motion will be&#xD;
      measured for both limbs.&#xD;

The scores of (-2), (-0.5), (0), (+1) and (+2) will be assigned if they feel that their condition is worst than before, better but not as good as expected, as expected, better than expected and much better than expected. All goals will be weighted equally, and final score will be calculated based on the available formula, in each session. The higher score is presenting of better outcome</description>
