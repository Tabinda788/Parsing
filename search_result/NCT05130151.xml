    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to find out how the investigators can use mobile phones to prevent&#xD;
      HIV and address related health problems such as sexual health and mental health among&#xD;
      adolescents. The investigators will evaluate and adapt an existing text-message and&#xD;
      interactive voice recognition (IVR) system. IVR is Interactive voice response is a technology&#xD;
      that allows humans to interact with a computer-operated phone system through the use of voice&#xD;
      and DTMF tones input via a keypad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system was designed by FHI 360 (note FHI 360 is the name of the non-profit not an&#xD;
      acronym). FHI 360 is an international nonprofit working to improve the health and well-being&#xD;
      of people in the United States and around the world. FHI 360 staffs more than 4,000&#xD;
      professionals who work in more than 60 countries. Examples of the existing content is&#xD;
      available (https://m4rh.fhi360.org/?page_id=191) and we have a letter of support from FHI&#xD;
      360, included in my funded grant proposal, stating we may use and modify this content as&#xD;
      needed. As noted below anyone can access this content by dialing #161 when in Uganda. FHI 360&#xD;
      sexual reproductive health information is currently available across Uganda for free and can&#xD;
      be accessed in by dialing #161.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research comprises two phases. Phase 1 involves two steps, (A) &quot;theater&#xD;
      pretesting&quot; (includes brief interviews) (B) focus groups (or more detailed interviews&#xD;
      depending on COVID-19 guidelines and described in detail below) that will involve asking&#xD;
      adolescents to discuss new messages that would provide basic information about pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) as well as, a set of questions about mental health, and alcohol use. We&#xD;
      will conduct focus groups with these adolescents and elicit responses to improve the&#xD;
      acceptability of the messages (described in detail below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will then modify any content as needed and conduct Phase 2 which involves (A) randomized&#xD;
      control trial and (B) qualitative key informant interviews. Adolescents (N=126) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the mobile phone-based intervention or to standard of care.&#xD;
      Through this approach we will evaluate our adaptation of FHI 360's existing text message and&#xD;
      interactive voice recognition (IVR). The adaptation will include PrEP information as well as&#xD;
      specific mental health and hazardous alcohol use screens, promote HIV prevention for all&#xD;
      adolescents, and support linkage to behavioral health counselors for symptomatic adolescents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background This study will result in the development of one of the first mobile phone-based&#xD;
      interventions for adolescents in East Africa that begins to address sexual health, mental&#xD;
      health, and alcohol use. Adolescence is a developmental period associated with the increased&#xD;
      importance of peers, increased technology use, increased mobility, initiation of sex,&#xD;
      emergence of mental health disorders (if at risk), and initiation of alcohol use. Thus, the&#xD;
      initial step of screening and linking adolescents with mental health or alcohol use problems&#xD;
      to counselors, may help address these factors and also reduce the risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Further, PrEP has only recently been made available to adolescents in Uganda&#xD;
      and is not currently included in the existing FHI 360 #161 system. As described by the CDC,&#xD;
      PrEP is a way for people who do not have HIV but who are at very high risk of getting HIV to&#xD;
      prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day. Studies have shown that PrEP reduces the&#xD;
      risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken daily. Adolescents today rely heavily on&#xD;
      mobile phones for information and services, thus the investigators believe the proposed&#xD;
      intervention could be applied and adapted across the region, and potentially in other&#xD;
      under-resourced settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To adapt an evidence-based mobile phone-delivered sexual health program, to include&#xD;
      PrEP information and deliver mental health and alcohol use assessments with the goal of&#xD;
      increasing screening and referral, as well as linkage to school-based counselors for&#xD;
      adolescents at HIV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate through a pilot RCT (N=126 adolescents, 15-19 years) intervention (a)&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility, and (b) impact on uptake of HIV prevention strategies, as well&#xD;
      as screening and linkage to mental health and alcohol use school-based counselors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For aim 3 the investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will uptake HIV testing&#xD;
      and a greater rate than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures There will be two phases to the study. The first will last approximately three&#xD;
      months and include 24 subjects (15-19 years). The second phase will include 140 subjects&#xD;
      (15-19 years) with a three-month intervention and a 6-month follow-up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The professional networks of Dr. Fred Ssewamala (K01 advisor) will be used to recruit schools&#xD;
      with potential participants. Dr. Ssewamala is the director of the International Center for&#xD;
      Child Health and Development (ICHAD) at the Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) School&#xD;
      of Medicine. ICHAD and Ssewamala have multiple NIH-funded studies among the target population&#xD;
      for the current study and existing relationships with local secondary schools and community&#xD;
      leaders. The study Project Director, a masters student at WUSTL and Ugandan national, will&#xD;
      contact ICHAD partnered schools and local community leaders using the attached text adapted&#xD;
      from prior studies in the region (see Recruitment Materials). The Project Director and&#xD;
      Research Assistant will work primarily out of the ICHAD offices in Masaka Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing intervention, designed by the international health organization FHI 360 and&#xD;
      regional technology partner Viamo, with Ugandan offices in Kampala, works through SMS or by&#xD;
      calling a designated short code, which in Uganda is *161. The system then automatically&#xD;
      responds with a menu of choices for accessing HIV prevention and contraceptive information,&#xD;
      as well as HIV clinic locations. To select an option, the user replies with an SMS using a&#xD;
      keyword or code from the provided menu. For example, &quot;press 5 for HIV prevention&quot; (see phone&#xD;
      number in Facilities for access to further examples). The system then provides an auto&#xD;
      response to the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our intervention, again working with regional tech-partner Viamo, will add to the current HIV&#xD;
      prevention menu, information on PrEP, such as &quot;PrEP, is a way to help prevent HIV by taking a&#xD;
      pill every day,&quot; Texting or calling this platform is free in Uganda and across East Africa&#xD;
      due to agreements between FHI360, the tech company Viamo, and regional phone networks. All&#xD;
      messages will be provided in English or Luganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Project Director and the Research Staff will be the primary research staff to interact&#xD;
      with participants. If needed Dr Ssewamala or PI Kreniske would assist. Depending on COVID-19&#xD;
      guidelines Dr. Kreniske may have the opportunity to directly interact with study&#xD;
      participants. For example, if possible, Kreniske would travel to Uganda at to observe the&#xD;
      Phase 1 or Phase 2 focus groups or interviews that could be conducted in English or Luganda&#xD;
      depending on the participants preferences. If needed, as a backup Kreniske would also assist&#xD;
      in conducting interviews or focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more adolescents express interest in participating in Phase I of the study than are needed&#xD;
      the investigators will keep their contact information in a secure locked filing cabinet or&#xD;
      encrypted laptop so that the investigators can reach them for potential participation in&#xD;
      Phase II. If more adolescents than are needed express interest in Phase II the investigators&#xD;
      will inform them that recruitment has concluded and thank them for their interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 involves two steps, (A) &quot;theater pretesting&quot; with daily brief individual interviews&#xD;
      (B) focus groups. Participants will be explicitly informed by the Project Director or&#xD;
      Research Assistant and via the consent form, that they are entitled to refrain from answering&#xD;
      any questions that arise during the interview or focus group which they do not wish to&#xD;
      answer. All interviews and focus groups will be audio recorded. Audio files will be&#xD;
      immediately moved to the Project Director's password protected, encrypted computer and&#xD;
      deleted after 1 year. Consistent with ongoing ICHAD research in the region, compensation for&#xD;
      adolescent participation will include US $7.33 in Uganda shillings in cash which will be&#xD;
      administered to the participant by the Project Director or Research Assistant at the&#xD;
      completion of interviews. The Project Director or Research Assistant have completed necessary&#xD;
      Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) courses including Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP) and Human Subjects Protection SBR with minors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theater pretesting involves developing the messages and concepts of an intervention and&#xD;
      exploring them with intended audiences, in this study - young people (15-19 years) (Table 6).&#xD;
      During theater pretesting 24 (12 men, 12 women) potentially eligible participants, referred&#xD;
      by members of local schools or local council members, will be prompted to view or listen to&#xD;
      and interact with the adapted mobile phone intervention messages and menus. Each day over a&#xD;
      1-week period adolescents will be prompted to interact with a different component of the&#xD;
      intervention generally requiring them to listen to about 5-7 messages or respond to 5-7&#xD;
      questions on the following topics (e.g. HIV prevention, HIV clinic locator, mental health&#xD;
      screen using The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), The Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#xD;
      Questionnaire (GAD-7) and alcohol use screen using the Alcohol Consumption Questions-C&#xD;
      (AUDIT-C). To ensure the investigators maintain confidentiality only adolescents who own&#xD;
      their phones will be recruited to the study. Text messages pop-up on the screen with the&#xD;
      notification 1 new message. However, only a person who has the password to the phone can&#xD;
      access the message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viamo's IVR-text-messaging system will be programmed to score responses to these measures in&#xD;
      the following way: If the respondents score 0 the system will respond with an auto message&#xD;
      thanking them for their responses. If respondents score a 1 or greater on the PHQ-2 + i9 or&#xD;
      GAD-7 they will then be given the full measures. In addition, the investigators will contact&#xD;
      the StrongMinds counselors and local agencies and follow established ICHAD procedures if any&#xD;
      respondent endorses the following suicide question &quot;Thoughts that you want to kill yourself,&#xD;
      or have you attempted suicide?&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this interaction participants will be contacted by our study coordinator or&#xD;
      research assistant and asked a series of brief questions to assess the intervention&#xD;
      components through an audio recorded phone call: (1) content (e.g. themes, materials,&#xD;
      role-play vignettes); (2) delivery; and (3) activities that may not be addressed to enhance&#xD;
      the intervention relevance. The investigators anticipate interacting with the platform and&#xD;
      the subsequent rapid interview will require a total of 10 minutes per day. At the end of the&#xD;
      week to assess acceptability, all 24 adolescents will be asked to complete a 12-item survey&#xD;
      to evaluate acceptability. This measure will be administered over the phone by the Project&#xD;
      Director or Research Assistant. To further evaluate feasibility, the investigators will use&#xD;
      measures previously used by FHI 360, including number of messages viewed, type of messages&#xD;
      viewed and number of times the service locator was used. The investigators will also measure&#xD;
      number of attempted and completed mental health and alcohol screens, and the use of counselor&#xD;
      referrals. As described below, the investigators will refer to StrongMinds, a&#xD;
      non-governmental organization who currently provide free mobile phone-based mental health&#xD;
      counseling in Uganda. Consistent with previous work, all messages to the system will be&#xD;
      tracked through electronic logging of message source (mobile phone number), type of&#xD;
      information (e.g. HIV prevention) and date and time of the message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then conduct 4 focus groups with 5-6 participants each. The purpose of&#xD;
      the focus groups, approximately 45-minute each, is to gather preliminary understanding of&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability and determine if modifications are needed. Currently, Uganda is&#xD;
      allowing people to gather in small groups under national mitigation strategies for research.&#xD;
      Depending on the COVID-19 guidelines at the time of the data collection the investigators are&#xD;
      prepared to hold in person interviews with COVID-19 precautions including social distancing,&#xD;
      required masks, and an outdoor meeting space or to conduct the groups over the phone if the&#xD;
      COVID-19 guidelines change. Areas of focus will include (a) the acceptability of the new PrEP&#xD;
      information, (b) Adolescents feedback on clinic referral message content, (c) preferences for&#xD;
      daily, weekly or no unsolicited messages, and (d) identifying technical issues. All&#xD;
      adolescents will also complete a brief acceptability measure that was used previously for&#xD;
      adolescents in Uganda. Responses to these questions will be used to facilitate adapting the&#xD;
      intervention to the adolescents 15-19 in Uganda. T&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, prior to the full randomized controlled pilot trial the investigators will soft&#xD;
      launch the adapted intervention with a group of 10 adolescents over a 1-month period. A soft&#xD;
      launch is often used in product development to identify any technical issues prior to a full&#xD;
      rollout or trial. The investigators will also employ a paired down version of the pre-post&#xD;
      assessments and questions of feasibility and acceptability with this group. This process will&#xD;
      allow us to correct any issues with the system prior to conducting the full trial. The&#xD;
      investigators will then conduct a pilot trial of the adapted mobile phone-based intervention&#xD;
      over 9 months. Adolescents (N = 140, but n = 126 after anticipated attrition) will be&#xD;
      randomized into two arms - 63 into the adapted mobile phone-based intervention arm, and 63&#xD;
      into standard education provided in schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care. Two curricula are delivered in all secondary schools in Uganda: Life&#xD;
      Planning Skills and Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health (ASRH). This is considered usual&#xD;
      care in our study, and all enrolled participants, both in control and treatment conditions,&#xD;
      will be exposed to these curricula. In the curricula, the content related to HIV and sexual&#xD;
      risk-taking behaviors includes delaying sex; using condoms and contraception; and preventing&#xD;
      substance abuse. This curriculum also includes education on gender equality and importance of&#xD;
      delayed marriage. The content is primarily delivered via class lectures. The ASRH content is&#xD;
      dispersed across a range of academic subjects in secondary schools. In each class, students&#xD;
      receive information about sexual activity, HIV prevention, and gender studies relevant to&#xD;
      that subject. Teachers and students all receive a sex and health education handbook&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the intervention the investigators will conduct 30 key informant interviews (KII)&#xD;
      with adolescents in the intervention arm. SRH and PrEP information is not currently included&#xD;
      in the Ugandan standard curricula, nor are mental health or substance use assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to use a simple text reminder such as &quot;Reach out and contact *161 for&#xD;
      your weekly check-in!&quot;. The weekly mobile check-in will require about 10-minutes of&#xD;
      participants time per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at baseline and each subsequent week (2 months total) participants will receive a&#xD;
      text message prompting them to interact with one menu. These menus include Current HIV&#xD;
      Prevention Strategies (including PrEP), SRH Clinic Locator, Depression Screen (PHQ-9),&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorder Screen (GAD-7), Alcohol Use Disorders Screen (AUDIT). As our primary outcome&#xD;
      is HIV testing adolescents will be prompted to interact with the Current HIV Prevention&#xD;
      Strategies (including PrEP) and SRH Clinic Locator in the first 2 weeks and the final 2 weeks&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will be asked to complete survey responses at baseline, immediately&#xD;
      post follow-up and 6 months later. Table 1 included below in the &quot;assessment instrument&quot;&#xD;
      section lists the full survey battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, immediately post-intervention the investigators will conduct 30 KII with&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group. Feasibility questions will be asked in relation to&#xD;
      texting barriers.&#xD;

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)(Kroenke K &amp; Spitzer RL, 2001) - a standardized 9-item self-report instrument - was used to assess depression. Participants rate the frequency of their symptoms over the past 2 weeks. Items are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) and scale scores range from 0 to 27. PHQ-9 scores of 5-9, represent minimal to mild depression, and 10-20 represent moderate to severe depression. As recommended, PHQ-9 scores ≥ 10 were considered indicative of screening positively for clinically significant depressive symptoms (Kroenke K &amp; Spitzer RL, 2001). The PHQ-9 has good test-retest reliability and validity. A score equal to or greater than 10 has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression (Kroenke K &amp; Spitzer RL, 2001).</description>
