  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study to determine the&#xD;
      effect of bathing given to premature babies on pain, sleep and vital signs. The data of the&#xD;
      study were obtained from premature newborns born at 34 weeks and above, who were hospitalized&#xD;
      in Selcuk University Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 1 June and 31 August 2020.&#xD;
      The sample size was determined as 64 premature newborns. &quot;Interview and Observation Form,&#xD;
      Neonatal Pain/Agitation, Sedation Scale&quot; was used for data collection. The data were&#xD;
      evaluated with the SPSS 21.0 package program using percentage, mean, standard deviation,&#xD;
      chi-square, t test, Anova and Tukey advanced analysis test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was carried out in the following order. All permissions were obtained for data&#xD;
      collection. Individual characteristics were obtained from family members and recorded in the&#xD;
      questionnaire. Before the procedure, the pain levels of the newborns were evaluated and&#xD;
      recorded. The status of babies in the study or control group was randomly determined&#xD;
      according to the hospitalization day (www.randomizer.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newborns in the study group were given a baby bath. The baby's body temperature, pulse,&#xD;
      respiration, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, saturation, oxygen demand, and N-PASS&#xD;
      scores were evaluated and recorded by two observers before the bath, at the 15th, 30th and&#xD;
      60th minutes after the bath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention was given to the newborns in the control group. However, body temperature,&#xD;
      pulse, respiration, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, saturation, oxygen demand and&#xD;
      N-PASS scores were evaluated and recorded in accordance with the measurement intervals of the&#xD;
      newborns in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohen's kappa analysis was performed to assess interobserver agreement. Since the&#xD;
      inter-observer agreement was found to be excellent (k=0.85), analysis was performed with an&#xD;
      observer evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All newborns were measured at the same time of the day.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The research will be carried out in the second and third level Neonatal Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      of X University Medical Faculty Hospital. 52 nurses and three neonatologists work in the&#xD;
      unit. 12 nurses (in-clinical training nurse, nutrition nurse) work during the day and 10&#xD;
      nurses at night. The average number of babies per nurse for care is three. Second and third&#xD;
      level patients are hospitalized in the clinic. The total number of beds is 45, with 36 beds&#xD;
      at the third level and nine beds at the second level. The average number of babies admitted&#xD;
      to the unit and treated is 55/550 monthly/yearly. (Due to the Covid 19 epidemic, the number&#xD;
      of hospitalized patients is less than in previous years.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outside the unit, there are mother-baby adjustment rooms where the resting needs of mothers&#xD;
      are met. There is no restriction on visiting hours for mothers in the clinic, mothers can see&#xD;
      and take care of their babies whenever participants want 24/7. Before the Covid 19 epidemic,&#xD;
      fathers had visiting hours, but during the epidemic, father visits were abolished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated with the G*Power 3.1.5 program with 95% power and 10%&#xD;
      difference at 0.05 significance level. The sample size was determined as 64 newborns, 32&#xD;
      children for each group. At the end of the study, Post Hoc power analysis will be performed&#xD;
      in order to determine the adequacy of the number of newborns included in the study. When it&#xD;
      is determined that 95% power is reached, the data collection process will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of control and study groups; The status of the children to be included in the&#xD;
      study in the control or study group will be determined by using &quot;stratification and&#xD;
      randomization methods with blocks&quot;, taking into account the hospital registration numbers and&#xD;
      gender of the newborns. Accordingly, children will be stratified as &quot;girls and boys&quot; for the&#xD;
      gender variable. 32 premature newborns will be included in each of the research groups. Since&#xD;
      the newborns and their families do not meet each other during the data collection process,&#xD;
      the interaction of the newborns in the study and control groups with each other will be&#xD;
      prevented.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of the change in the pain status of the newborn according to the initial value with Neonatal Pain Agitation And Sedation Scale (N-PASS) just before the bath, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after the bath.&#xD;
N-PASS, which consists of two separate sections measuring the sedation level and pain level of the baby; It consists of 5 sub-parameters including crying and restlessness, behavior-state, facial expression, hands and feet, body tension and vital signs. A score between 0 and +2 is given for each behavioral and physiological criterion in the evaluation of pain, and between 0 and -2 in the evaluation of sedation. If the baby was born before 30 weeks of gestation, +1 point is added to the total score in the pain assessment. The total pain score ranges from 0 to +11, and the total sedation score ranges from 0 to 10. A high score indicates that the severity of pain is high.</description>

    <description>Newborn bathing will be done by the same nurse for each newborn in the study group. Since the evening hours are thought to be calmer for the baby bath, the hours between 22:00-24:00 will be chosen. Each newborn will be disinfected with only water beforehand and showered in the sinks used to wash the baby in the clinic. Bath time will be limited to two minutes. Newborns will be dried and dressed immediately after bathing. Monitor probes for monitor follow-ups and blood pressure cuffs will be connected to prevent extra touching during measurements.</description>
