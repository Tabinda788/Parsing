  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with laser&#xD;
      technology under the guidance of imaging modalities to assist with surgical excision,&#xD;
      including optical coherence tomography imaging (OCT) and reflectance confocal microscopy&#xD;
      (RCM). The laser modality that we plan to use is the long-pulse Nd:YAG 1064nm laser, which is&#xD;
      a nonablative laser already shown to effectively treat BCC. The addition of OCT and RCM has&#xD;
      the opportunity to enhance outcomes by better targeting the treatment and permitting more&#xD;
      precise monitoring of clearance. OCT is being used to enhance the effectiveness of Mohs&#xD;
      Micrographic Surgery of these cancers by elucidating more definitive tumor margins. RCM has&#xD;
      been shown to detect changes in the composition of cells consistent with BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to use these imaging devices to guide the laser treatment to achieve optimal&#xD;
      efficacy with minimized side-effects. Primary outcome measured include complete clearance of&#xD;
      the BCC lesion, which will be determined through clinical examination, dermoscopy, imaging&#xD;
      (OCT and/or RCM), and saucerization biopsy. Secondary outcome variables include the&#xD;
      significance of lesion depth (by OCT and/or RCM), lateral extent (by OCT and/or RCM), BCC&#xD;
      type, and anatomical region on rate of clearance and recurrence.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one (1) biopsy-proven superficial or nodular BCC, less than or equal to 2.0&#xD;
             cm in largest dimension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to have photographs taken of the treatment area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and carry out subject instructions or be represented by a&#xD;
             legally authorized guardian or representative&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a BCC lesion that requires excision. This would include relatively large&#xD;
             lesions (greater than or equal to &gt;2.0 cm diameter), lesions that penetrate deep into&#xD;
             the skin beyond the depth of the OCT image capture, high risk lesions as defined by&#xD;
             the American Academy of Dermatology as recurrent and sclerosing subtype BCC, or&#xD;
             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to follow-up for the full 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects not willing to have biopsy taken from the treatment area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with herpes simplex virus infection in treatment areas.&#xD;
