  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaction of mandibular third molars is a commonly encountered problem in oral surgery;&#xD;
      patients frequently visit dental OPDs with complains related to the impacted molars, and in&#xD;
      almost all situations, surgical removal of these impactions is the definitive treatment&#xD;
      provided to such patients. This type of surgery often involves osteotomies and tooth&#xD;
      sectioning, that initiates acute inflammatory responses which results in significant amount&#xD;
      of postoperative discomfort owing to the associated pain, swelling and trismus; which&#xD;
      considerably affects the quality of life that may span from days up to weeks in few&#xD;
      instances. In the past decades, different group of medications have been used to counter&#xD;
      these adverse postoperative sequelae, such as steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAIDs) and&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, double-blind, clinical trial with a split-mouth design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The study would be conducted at Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery department, Dr.&#xD;
      Ishrat-ul-Ebad Khan Institute of Oral Health Sciences, Dow University of Health Sciences,&#xD;
      Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: Six months after the approval of synopsis. Sample size: A total of 170&#xD;
      patients would be included in the study, i.e. 85 in each group with 2 patients as a drop out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculated sample size is 83 patients per group; utilizing Pass version 11 software with 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval, mean ± S.D of swelling in dexamethasone group1 95.7 ± 11.1 and in&#xD;
      etoricoxib group1 100.0 ± 8.3 at measurement 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique: Purposive non-probability sampling technique would be used for the&#xD;
      selection of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample selection: Patients meeting the following criteria would be included in the study: 1.&#xD;
      Age 18-35 years. 2. Absence of any systemic disease. 3. Mandibular third molars in similar&#xD;
      position with similar root formation. 3. No use of any medication in last 03 days. 4. Absence&#xD;
      of allergy to any drug used in the study. 5. Surgical site with no current signs or symptoms&#xD;
      of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting any of the following criteria would be excluded from the study: 1. Pregnancy&#xD;
      or lactation. 2. History of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer. 3. Current smoking&#xD;
      habit.&#xD;

      Impaction of mandibular third molars is a commonly encountered problem in oral surgery;&#xD;
      patients frequently visit dental OPDs with complains related to the impacted molars, and in&#xD;
      almost all situations, surgical removal of these impactions is the definitive treatment&#xD;
      provided to such patients. This type of surgery often involves osteotomies and tooth&#xD;
      sectioning, that initiates acute inflammatory responses which results in significant amount&#xD;
      of postoperative discomfort owing to the associated pain, swelling and trismus; which&#xD;
      considerably affects the quality of life that may span from days up to weeks in few&#xD;
      instances. In the past decades, different group of medications have been used to counter&#xD;
      these adverse postoperative sequelae, such as steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAIDs) and&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to its predominant glucocorticosteroid effects, minimal sodium retention activity and&#xD;
      long half-life, dexamethasone remains the most popular drug used in third molar surgery. And&#xD;
      with the advantages of fewer gastrointestinal side effects, not disturbing platelet function&#xD;
      and being well tolerated, the selective COX-2 inhibitor, Etoricoxib, is a suitable analgesic&#xD;
      for the treatment of acute pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lima et al2 concluded in their study that preemptive administration of dexamethasone showed&#xD;
      better control of pain and swelling following impacted third molar extraction. Gaetano et al3&#xD;
      showed a greater reduction in incidence and severity of postoperative pain treated with&#xD;
      etoricoxib compared with diclofenac, in impacted third molar surgery. Despite a lot of&#xD;
      research related to the efficacy of dexamethasone and etoricoxib as preemptive drugs in&#xD;
      controlling the postoperative sequelae, there is a negligible amount of research material&#xD;
      available comparing the efficacy of these two anti-inflammatory drugs, therefore, the purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to compare the preemptive anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly into the medial pterygoid muscle immediately after local&#xD;
      anesthesia, with Etroicoxib given orally 1 hour prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would help the clinicians in better understanding the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      consequences associated with a common oral surgical procedure. The results of this study&#xD;
      would greatly enhance understanding about which drug to prescribe for the better control of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory sequelae of impacted third molar surgery, thereby, avoiding unnecessary&#xD;
      drug prescriptions which would be ultimately beneficial for the patient undergoing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the preemptive anti-inflammatory efficacy&#xD;
      of dexamethasone administered intramuscularly with etoricoxib given orally, following the&#xD;
      impacted third molar surgery.&#xD;
