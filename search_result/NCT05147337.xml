    <time_frame>From Screening up to 14 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 56 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS (mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment [C-CASA]) is an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess any suicidality, suicidal behavior, or suicidal ideation. Any suicidality is emergence of any suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. Any suicidal behavior is indicated when response is &quot;yes&quot; for any these questions- actual attempt to suicide, engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts. Any suicidal ideation is indicated when response is &quot;yes&quot; for any of these questions- wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent to suicide.</description>
