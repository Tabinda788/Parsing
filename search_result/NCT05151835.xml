    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center cohort study on effect of a novel robotic surgical system&#xD;
      for performance of minimally invasive surgery in multiple specialties. The targeted&#xD;
      procedures include Urological, upper and lower GI robotic surgeries and the expected sample&#xD;
      size will be 20 patients. The clinical outcomes for assessment include background&#xD;
      demographics, operative time, perioperative complications as well as completion rate of&#xD;
      procedure, hospital stay and recovery.&#xD;

      This is a prospective single center cohort study on effect of a novel robotic surgical system&#xD;
      for performance of minimally invasive surgery in multiple specialties. The targeted&#xD;
      procedures include Urological, upper and lower GI robotic surgeries and the expected sample&#xD;
      size will be 20 patients. The procedures will be standardized according to previously&#xD;
      reported. The diseases for robotic surgical treatment will include prostate carcinoma,&#xD;
      colorectal carcinoma, as well as esophageal hiatal diseases and gastric carcinoma. The&#xD;
      clinical outcomes for assessment include background demographics, operative time,&#xD;
      perioperative complications as well as completion rate of procedure, hospital stay and&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;

    <description>The K2 Robotic Surgical System is a software-controlled, electro-mechanical system designed for surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgery in the thorax and abdomen. The K2 Robotic Surgical System consists of a Surgeon Console [SGC], a Patient Side Robot [PSR], and a Vision Cart [VCT], and is used with an endoscope, Surgical Instruments [SGI], and Accessories [ACC]. The surgeon views the three-dimensional endoscopic image on a High-Resolution Stereo Viewer (3D Viewer), which provides a view of the abdominal cavity and surgical instrumentation, along with icons and other user interface features.</description>
