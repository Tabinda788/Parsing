  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to improve the regularity of medication intake for high blood&#xD;
      pressure. Adult women and men who are over 50 years old, who have received a prescription&#xD;
      drug for high blood pressure from MediService, and who have to take at least 4 tablets per&#xD;
      day (of which at least 1 dose of medication per day is for high blood pressure) can&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to examine whether Collabree, a mobile phone application, is&#xD;
      effective in supporting patients with hypertension to more successfully following their&#xD;
      therapy plan in order to improve the regularity of medication intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a 90-day intervention phase and a 90-day follow-up. The study does not&#xD;
      require any therapy adjustments and no visits to a study center are necessary. The&#xD;
      participants conduct the study independently at home. Participants will also fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of 3 groups in a ratio of 1: 1: 1. Two of these&#xD;
      groups will receive the Collabree mobile phone application.&#xD;
