      This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to compare&#xD;
      effects of aldafermin, NGM282, 1 mg, and placebo given daily by subcutaneous injection on&#xD;
      bowel functions and hepatic synthesis and fecal excretion of bile acids in patients with&#xD;
      diarrhea associated with bile acid malabsorption (BAM). Thirty patients will receive either&#xD;
      aldafermin (NGM282) or placebo, not both. The study includes a 7 to 28-day long prescreen&#xD;
      period and a 28-day long treatment period for a maximum study duration of 56 days. Bowel&#xD;
      pattern will be assessed by patient-recorded daily bowel pattern diaries. Serum 7-alpha C4&#xD;
      (C4) and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19) and fecal bile acids will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline and Day 14 and Day 28 of treatment. Safety will be assessed through regular&#xD;
      monitoring of adverse events, clinical laboratory results, 12-lead ECGs, physical&#xD;
      examinations, and vital signs.&#xD;

    <description>Aldafermin (NGM282) is an investigational medication. It is an engineered analog of FGF-19 which reduces synthesis of bile acids and diarrhea caused by elevated bile acids. Participants receive aldafermin (NGM282) 1 mg given by subcutaneous injection once daily for 28 days.</description>
