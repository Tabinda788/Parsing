      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of the combination of PCR and CRISPR/Cas12a (SSBD)in tract secretion from&#xD;
      lower respiratory for early targeted anti-infective therapy for patients with severe&#xD;
      pneumonia. 5 adult ICU units from 5 hospitals in Jiangsu province participate the study and&#xD;
      the hosted unit is the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital&#xD;
      of Nanjing University Medical College. All patients are randomly assigned to the experiment&#xD;
      group and the control group. For experiment group, the combined detection of PCR&#xD;
      andCRISPR/Cas12a is carried out in the early stage, and the antibiotic scheme is changed base&#xD;
      on the results of PCR-CRISPR/Cas12a. The patients in the control group are adjusted according&#xD;
      to the traditional microbial detection methods. Some clinical parameters and outcomes are&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ICU patients have a high incidence of bacterial infection in the lower respiratory tract,&#xD;
      mainly with severe pneumonia, often causing severe sepsis and septic shock, which is one of&#xD;
      the main causes of death in patients. At present, the biggest difficulty faced by clinicians&#xD;
      is the continuous increase of bacterial resistance rate and the increase of patient mortality&#xD;
      due to the early inadequacy empirical anti-infective treatment. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      patients with VAP(Ventilator Associated Pneumonia) have irrational drug use in the early&#xD;
      stage, with a mortality rate of more than 50%. When the rate of appropriate drug use has&#xD;
      dropped to 33%, while mechanical ventilation time and ICU hospitalization time have been&#xD;
      significantly shortened. Therefore, identifying pathogenes as early as possible and&#xD;
      shortening the time of empirical anti-infective treatment are very important for improving&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients with severe pneumonia and reducing the incidence of bacterial&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three traditional methods for detecting pathogenic microorganisms: 1. microbial&#xD;
      culture method is the most traditional means of identifying pathogen. It is necessary to&#xD;
      inoculate the patient's body fluid, blood, etc. in a suitable medium, incubate in a suitable&#xD;
      incubator, and then pass the drug. Sensitivity tests determine the resistance of&#xD;
      microorganisms, usually takes 3-7 days. For some specific types of pathogenic microorganisms&#xD;
      or microorganisms with harsh growth conditions, there may be negative culture results.&#xD;
      Therefore, the traditional culture methods have disadvantages such as poor timeliness,&#xD;
      relatively high requirements, and low positive culture rate (30-40%). 2. time-of-flight mass&#xD;
      spectrometry: the mass spectrometry technique is used to analyze and detect the protein&#xD;
      components of the strain, and the characteristic peak spectrum is obtained. Compared with the&#xD;
      bacterial map in the database, the bacteria can be judged by matching. The method can be&#xD;
      shortened by about 6-8 hours compared with the conventional culture method, but since the&#xD;
      detection of the colony needs to reach a certain amount, the specimen can not be directly&#xD;
      detected after obtaining the specimen, and the preliminary microbial culture is required.&#xD;
      Therefore, the detection time still takes 1-2 days or more, and there is also the&#xD;
      disadvantage of low timeliness. In addition, it is necessary to compare the expansion and&#xD;
      standardization of the database, and the inability to analyze the resistance of&#xD;
      microorganisms is also the inadequacy of the detection technology. 3. High-throughput&#xD;
      sequencing technology: With the rapid development of molecular biology in recent years,&#xD;
      high-throughput sequencing technology is widely used in the early diagnosis of clinical&#xD;
      microbiology, the principle is mainly through the connection of the universal linker to the&#xD;
      fragmentation to be sequenced. Genomic DNA, which produces tens of millions of&#xD;
      single-molecule polyclonal polymerase chain reaction arrays, then performs large-scale primer&#xD;
      hybridization and enzyme extension reactions, and obtains complete DNA sequence information&#xD;
      by computer analysis. However, this technology is difficult to effectively distinguish&#xD;
      between pathogenic bacteria and background bacteria, technology and database to be&#xD;
      standardized, detection time still takes about 2 days, can not obtain microbial resistance,&#xD;
      expensive and other shortcomings At the office. In summary, the current time limit for&#xD;
      targeted anti-infective treatment is stopped 2 days after the specimen is taken. Therefore,&#xD;
      the search for new, pathogenic microbial detection technology that is faster, more accurate&#xD;
      and more sensitive is a hotspot and a difficult point in the field of microbial and&#xD;
      anti-infective research in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRISPR/Cas12a has trans-cleavage activity, which could be developed as a new molecular method&#xD;
      for testing specific nucleotide sequences with high specificity and sensitivity . We thus&#xD;
      initiatively designed the Species-Specific Bacterial Detector (SSBD) system basing on&#xD;
      CRISPR/Cas12a. In theory, the method is prominent with rapidity, high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity, and variable detection targets, which is an innovation in microorganism&#xD;
      identification and maybe bring benefits to sepsis treatment. As some particular bacteria&#xD;
      account of most of sepsis, 12 common bacteria are chosen as the initial panel according to&#xD;
      previous studies and local epidemic data from our hospital. Our aim of the study is to&#xD;
      establish and validate the effectiveness of the SSBD system through comparing with culture&#xD;
      results, and then evaluate the possible clinical values in therapy adjustments and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of severe pneumonia in ICU, which was the major causes of sepsis.&#xD;
