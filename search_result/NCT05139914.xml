  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have changes in blood vessel health that can&#xD;
      lead to a higher chance of developing heart attacks or strokes. New medications for T2DM&#xD;
      including dapagliflozin, which is a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2)&#xD;
      inhibitor, may help protect the heart and blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of this mechanistic study is to learn how a Sodium-Glucose&#xD;
      Cotransporter-2 (SGT2) inhibitor, dapagliflozin, impacts vascular health in patients with&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The investigators will compare the changes in vascular&#xD;
      health to changes in endothelial cell (EC) phenotype including non-coding RNA (ncRNA) to&#xD;
      develop evidence supporting the mechanism of cardiovascular benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors. This&#xD;
      study will provide novel information regarding the mechanism of effects of novel treatments&#xD;
      for endothelial function and vascular health in patients with T2DM to reduce cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) risk. The research aims to assess the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effects of dapagliflozin on EC phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impact of dapagliflozin on vasodilator function and additional measures of vascular&#xD;
           health including arterial stiffness and circulating markers of vascular health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study design is a two-treatment, two-period crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      design study to investigate the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, on EC&#xD;
      phenotype, EC RNA levels, circulating microRNA (miRNA), and biomarkers in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to treatment order in a 1:1 ratio to receive SGLT2 inhibitor&#xD;
      (dapagliflozin) and then placebo or vice versa in a crossover design. Total study period for&#xD;
      each study subject is 14 weeks consisting of: two treatment periods (dapagliflozin and&#xD;
      placebo) lasting 6 weeks each (12 weeks total) and a 2 week washout period between treatment&#xD;
      periods. Each subject undergoes a washout period of 2 weeks after completing first 6 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with either placebo or dapagliflozin. This is followed by crossover to the&#xD;
      alternate treatment period of 6 weeks with dapagliflozin or placebo depending on their first&#xD;
      treatment. Randomization will be done in block sizes of 2 or 4. Once assigned to treatment,&#xD;
      participants will receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or placebo for 6 weeks.&#xD;
