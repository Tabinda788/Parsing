  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis has a very high prevalence in the population over 50 years of age.&#xD;
      Patients with osteoarthritis often suffer from chronic pain that becomes disabling, affecting&#xD;
      both quality of life and mental and physical health. This pathology has also been linked to&#xD;
      maladaptive plasticity in the brain, which can contribute to chronic pain. Therapies with&#xD;
      neuromodulatory approaches, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and&#xD;
      peripheral electrical stimulation (TENS), have been used therapeutically to counteract the&#xD;
      maladaptive plasticity of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial therapy and TENS can be a possible effective treatment in the rehabilitation&#xD;
      services of the health system for the improvement of chronic pain and quality of life in&#xD;
      different pathologies, such as chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia or knee and hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;

    <description>tDCS intervention will consist in placing two electrodes, the cathode on the supraorbital surface on the same side as the painful knee, and the anode on the parietal area, corresponding to the area of the primary motor cortex, on the opposite side. The intensity will be 2 milli amperes (mA) and stimulation will be 20 minutes. The placebo will generate an initial sensation, and then descend until the stimulation is turned off.</description>

    <description>TENS intervention will consist in placing two electrodes on the sides of the patella of the affected knee. The frequency will be 10Herzts and the intensity will remain at a sensitive threshold level, without reaching the motor. The placebo will generate a sensation of current to descend to the minimum value that the equipment allows. Stimulation will last for 20 minutes.</description>
