  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to explore the potential metabolic health benefits of a dietary&#xD;
      fibre intervention by using Soluble Fibre in a human intervention study in Healthy Obese&#xD;
      Pre-diabetic participants over a period of 16 weeks with a focus on long term glucose&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that twice daily supplementation with Soluble Fibre over a period of 16&#xD;
      weeks will significantly improve long term glucose control in pre-diabetic participants.&#xD;
