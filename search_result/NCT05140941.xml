  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm study of Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) for treatment of&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C infection during pregnancy. Treatment will be initiated during the second&#xD;
      or third trimester in approximately 100 pregnant people. Maternal participants will take one&#xD;
      SOF/VEL tablet once daily for 12 weeks (84 days) and followed until 12 weeks after treatment&#xD;
      completion (postpartum). Infants will be followed from birth until one year of age. The&#xD;
      primary objectives are to evaluate the sustained virologic response 12 weeks after completion&#xD;
      of SOF/VEL treatment (SVR12) in participants treated during pregnancy and to evaluate impact&#xD;
      of antenatal treatment with SOF/VEL on the gestational age at delivery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4, multicenter study, single arm study of Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir (SOF/VEL)&#xD;
      for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection during pregnancy. Participants will be&#xD;
      screened between 12+0 and 29+6 weeks of gestation confirmed by ultrasound. HCV RNA level to&#xD;
      confirm the patient has active infection will be obtained. Laboratory evaluation of liver&#xD;
      function will be obtained, to evaluate for renal insufficiency, decompensated cirrhosis and&#xD;
      baseline elevations of lipase and creatine kinase. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen will be&#xD;
      performed to look for evidence of active HBV infection. Medical history and demographic&#xD;
      information will also be collected at screening. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      met, the patient will be enrolled into the study between 20+0 and 30+0 weeks' gestation and&#xD;
      initiate a 12-week course of a fixed-dose combination tablet of sofosbuvir 400 mg and&#xD;
      velpatasvir 100 mg. Maternal participants will take one SOF/VEL tablet once daily for 12&#xD;
      weeks (84 days). The study will be completed in 8 or 9 visits (6 maternal visits and 3 infant&#xD;
      visits). The primary endpoints are 1) maternal HCV RNA PCR 12 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      SOF/VEL treatment (HCV RNA PCR below the lower limit of quantification will be considered&#xD;
      evidence of SVR12) and 2) preterm delivery (spontaneous and iatrogenic) prior to 37 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation. The secondary endpoints are 1) Maternal safety defined as maternal adverse events&#xD;
      and pregnancy and delivery outcomes (stillbirth or intrauterine fetal demise, intrapartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage, postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes,&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction, cholestasis of pregnancy, severe maternal morbidity (defined&#xD;
      by CDC), maternal admission to the intensive care unit, maternal death), 2) composite&#xD;
      neonatal/Infant safety endpoints defined as severe neonatal morbidity with admission to&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit and stratified by perinatal preterm (&lt;37 weeks) (including fetal&#xD;
      or neonatal death, severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (grade 3) intraventricular hemorrhage&#xD;
      grades III-IV, necrotizing enterocolitis (proven - Bell Stage 2A or greater), periventricular&#xD;
      leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity stage III-V, or proven sepsis (early or late)) and&#xD;
      perinatal term (&gt;= 37 weeks) (including fetal or neonatal death, respiratory support , Apgar&#xD;
      score ≤ 3 at 5 minutes, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, seizure, infection (sepsis or&#xD;
      pneumonia), birth trauma, meconium aspiration syndrome, intracranial or subgaleal hemorrhage,&#xD;
      or hypotension requiring vasopressor support). Other secondary endpoints are admission to the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal death, major malformations, defined as structural&#xD;
      abnormalities with medical, surgical or cosmetic importance, weight, length, and head&#xD;
      circumference at birth (by exam or chart review), 8 weeks, six months and 12 months,&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental assessments at 6 months and 12 months by Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires®,&#xD;
      and infant HCV RNA PCR viral load at 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
