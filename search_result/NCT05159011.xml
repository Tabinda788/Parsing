    <textblock>
      AGILITY is a type 1 hybrid trial that will test the effectiveness of a chatbot to provide&#xD;
      pre-test information about genetic screening for tier 1 conditions. A randomized control&#xD;
      trial of 2400 adult participants from diverse primary care clinics at the University of&#xD;
      Florida Gainesville to receive virtual information about tier 1 condition genetic testing&#xD;
      from a chatbot or traditional genetic counseling. The assessment of the outcome of the trial&#xD;
      is to determine whether the chatbot is inferior to genetic counseling. Non-inferiority will&#xD;
      be determined based on informed choice to undergo testing (or not). Implementation outcomes&#xD;
      of acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness will be evaluated to inform future&#xD;
      potential through interviews with patients, primary care providers and GCs.&#xD;

      potential through interviews with patients, primary care providers and GCs. This trial will&#xD;
      provide evidence of whether chatbots can serve to address a shortage of genetic counselors by&#xD;
      extending pre-test education in a population screening environment to alternate sources such&#xD;
      as chatbots. Inclusion of an observation arm for individuals with positive family history who&#xD;
      then are offered traditional clinical genetic service is a strength of the design that will&#xD;
      allow for contrast between populations and service models as well. Inclusion of assessments&#xD;
      of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness from multiple stakeholders is critical to&#xD;
      future study design and implementation potential.&#xD;

    <description>The number of participants that made an informed choice (Multi-dimensional Model of Informed Choice) following a chatbot intervention compared to the number of participants that made an informed choice following genetic counseling. Informed choice is measured using a composite tool that includes understanding of relevant knowledge (1-8 items-higher scores indicate greater knowledge), attitudes toward testing (1-5 items-higher scores represent more positive attitudes), and whether the test decision is congruent with personal values (positive or negative about testing in relation to whether testing was accepted or declined).</description>
