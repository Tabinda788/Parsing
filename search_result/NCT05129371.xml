      In this study, It is aimed to evaluate the effect of breathing exercise on fatigue in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure, to reduce the severity of fatigue in participants, and thus to&#xD;
      enable patients to participate more actively in daily life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Heart Failure Prevalence and Indicators study in Turkey, the prevalence of heart&#xD;
      failure (HF) in the adult population was determined as 3.2%. In line with this study,&#xD;
      although Turkey has a young population, it is seen that the prevalence of HF is higher than&#xD;
      in western countries. As it is known, fatigue is one of the most characteristic symptoms of&#xD;
      HF and it was determined that the perceived fatigue was moderate or severe in 92% of the&#xD;
      patients. There is a decrease in the activities of daily living of patients with fatigue and&#xD;
      their quality of life is adversely affected. For this reason, nurses have an active role in&#xD;
      the evaluation of fatigue and in ensuring that the patient can cope with fatigue with&#xD;
      appropriate interventions. In the management of fatigue, non-pharmacological approaches are&#xD;
      frequently used in addition to current pharmacological treatment. Breathing exercises, one of&#xD;
      the non-pharmacological approaches used; consists of breathing control and exercises that&#xD;
      create body awareness. It also controls the instincts and the mind. In a study conducted with&#xD;
      patients with multiple sclerosis; Upper extremity exercise and breathing exercises were&#xD;
      combined as a home-based program, 2 days a week in 60-minute sessions. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that the 4-week program contributes to the reduction of fatigue. However; A&#xD;
      study reported to be the first to evaluate the effects of yoga and specific breathing&#xD;
      techniques for improving cardiovascular function, autonomic system, and quality of life in&#xD;
      heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction is still in the patient selection and&#xD;
      intervention stages. In this study, the participants were randomly divided into three groups,&#xD;
      and active breathing techniques were applied to the first group and passive breathing&#xD;
      techniques to the second group. The third group (control) receives standard pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment. The application period is done in 45-minute sessions twice a week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      There is no study in the literature investigating the effect of breathing exercise on fatigue&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure. In this study, which was planned in the light of this&#xD;
      information; It is aimed to evaluate the effect of breathing exercise on fatigue in patients&#xD;
      with heart failure, to reduce the severity of fatigue in patients, and thus to enable&#xD;
      patients to participate more actively in daily life.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients willing to participate in the study are evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Afterwards, they are divided into 3 groups with the stratified sampling method. The intervention group is given face-to-face breathing exercises under the supervision of the trainer, through video calls over the WhatsApp application after discharge. The placebo group is asked to breathe normally through the nose with eyes closed, sitting in the same position as the intervention group, under the supervision of the trainer. Venous oxygen saturation, heart rate/minute and respiratory rate/minute are monitored by pulse oximetry given to the participants in the intervention and placebo groups before and after each session for 8 weeks. The severity of fatigue of the participants in all groups; It is measured before starting the application, in the middle of the application period (4th week) and after the application is completed (8th week).</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue severity is expected to change in the intervention group compared to the other groups. Fatigue severity will be measured with Piper Fatigue Scale at the end of the 1st and 2nd months. The Piper Fatigue Scale consists of 22 items, each of which is evaluated over time on a 0-10 point VAS (Visual Analog Scale), and evaluates the patient's subjective perception of fatigue with four sub-dimensions. Total fatigue score is obtained by summing the items and dividing by the total number of items. As a result of the average score, 0 points indicate no fatigue, 1-3 points indicate mild fatigue, 4-6 points indicate moderate fatigue, and 7-10 points indicate severe fatigue. It was determined that the items in the subgroup and the general scale were in a strong relationship, and the reliability coefficient was quite high, 0.94 in the general scale. As a result, it has been determined that this scale is reliable in evaluating the multidimensional perception of fatigue.</description>
