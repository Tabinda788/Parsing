  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VIDO has developed a vaccine called COVAC-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study vaccine contains a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, called S1. The spike&#xD;
      protein is the part of the virus that is responsible for attaching to the surface of host&#xD;
      cells. COVAC-1 contains an adjuvant called TriAdj. An adjuvant is a compound that is added to&#xD;
      a vaccine to help the vaccine produce a better immune response. The TriAdj adjuvant is made&#xD;
      up of three components (a toll-like receptor agonist polyI:C, an immunostimulatory host&#xD;
      defense protein HDP IDR-1002 and a polyphosphazene carrier system, PCEP). The three&#xD;
      components work together to improve the body's response to the S1 protein. The COVAC-1&#xD;
      vaccine is expected to stimulate the body to make antibodies against the S1 protein. The&#xD;
      antibodies will recognize the viral spike protein if the body is exposed to the virus and&#xD;
      prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 illness. In animal studies, the immune response&#xD;
      generated by the COVAC-1 vaccine was able to protect the vaccinated animals against a severe&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is a multi-centred, multi-national trial of the COVAC-1 vaccine to be completed in&#xD;
      Canada and Brazil. It will be a randomized, observer-blinded, and placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      assess the safety and immunogenicity of two dosing levels (25 and 50 µg S1 protein)&#xD;
      administered twice (4 weeks apart) in healthy adults 18 through 54 years of age (Arm 1a) and&#xD;
      55 years of age and older (Arm 1b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment and vaccination of participants will be staggered over time based on vaccine dose.&#xD;
      Study participants aged 18 to 54 and those &gt;55 years of age will commence in parallel at the&#xD;
      starting dose of 25 ug and after approval by Sponsor based upon recommendations from the Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), new study participants will be allowed to receive the higher&#xD;
      dose of 50 ug. Approval will also be sought from Sponsor, based on recommendations provided&#xD;
      by the DSMB, to proceed with the second dose in each dosing and age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the same age group, the 8 participants receiving the lower dose are randomized with 4&#xD;
      participants receiving placebo and the 8 participants receiving the highest dose are&#xD;
      randomized with 4 participants receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each dose level of 12 participants, it is proposed to immunize a first cohort of 3&#xD;
      participants (including at least 2 active vaccine participants) and pending no holding rule&#xD;
      is met after 48 hours, as determined by the 48-hour-post-dose 1 phone call, to immunize the&#xD;
      remaining 9 participants within that dose level. Every attempt will be made to fully enroll&#xD;
      all age groups.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Generally healthy male and female adults aged 18 years of age or older at the time of&#xD;

             period is not anticipated. Also, the participant appears likely to be able to remain&#xD;
             in follow-up through the end of protocol-specified period. Mild to moderate&#xD;
             well-controlled comorbidities are allowed.&#xD;

             significantly increase the risk of study participant or, in the Investigator's&#xD;
             judgment, make the participant inappropriate for the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically significant bleeding disorder (e.g., clotting factor deficiency,&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Hematologic or biochemical laboratory abnormalities (blood or urine), as defined by&#xD;
             lab normal ranges. To exclude transient abnormalities, the Investigator may repeat a&#xD;
             test once, and if the repeat test is normal according to local reference ranges,&#xD;
             participant may be enrolled. Grade 1 abnormalities of laboratory values will not be&#xD;
             exclusionary if considered not clinically significant by the Investigator. And;&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Known current or previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-1 OR SARS-CoV-2 infection, as&#xD;
             documented by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from a nasal swab OR&#xD;
