  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vivo drug dissolution in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is largely unmeasured. The&#xD;
      purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the in vivo drug dissolution and systemic&#xD;
      absorption of modified release formulations of the BCS Class II drug Glipizide by direct&#xD;
      sampling of stomach and small intestinal luminal content, blood, urine and feces. Also&#xD;
      collection of physiologic data (such as pressure, temperature and GI transit time) from GI&#xD;
      tract through an electronic pill taken by mouth called SmartPill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expanding current knowledge of drug dissolution in vivo will help to establish&#xD;
      physiologically relevant in vitro models predictive of drug dissolution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an in vivo study designed to acquire human gastrointestinal (GI) physiology data from&#xD;
      healthy subjects which are necessary for mechanistic absorption model development. Each&#xD;
      subject will be asked to complete two phases. The first phase will include collection of&#xD;
      fluids from stomach and gastrointestinal (GI) tract through intubation (putting a GI tube&#xD;
      from mouth into stomach and intestines), blood, urine and feces, and measure glipizide&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase will not involve the intubation procedure. Instead, An electronic pill&#xD;
      called SmartPill will be used. The pill is swallowed by mouth and collects physiologic data&#xD;
      (such as pressure, temperature and GI transit time) as it travels through GI tract. Blood,&#xD;
      urine and feces, will also be collected for measurement of glipizide concentrations. A&#xD;
      minimum of 5 days will separate each of the two study phases. The objectives of this study&#xD;
      are, as follows: Objective #1: To characterize the plasma, gastrointestinal fluid, urine, and&#xD;
      feces concentrations of glipizide after oral administration of modified release formulations;&#xD;
      Objective #2: To compare the pharmacokinetics of glipizide between the two modified release&#xD;
      formulations; Objective #3: To compare the pharmacokinetics of glipizide with and without&#xD;
      gastrointestinal intubation; Objective #4: To collect gastrointestinal physiology data in&#xD;
      volunteers receiving an oral MR formulation of glipizide. These in vivo results will be used&#xD;
      to validate in vitro dissolution methods and to support computational and mathematical&#xD;
      modeling efforts, in order to develop an oral drug product optimization process that may be&#xD;
      applied to future drugs to maximize oral drug safety and efficacy.&#xD;
