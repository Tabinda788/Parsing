      CD276 (B7-H3) is a member of the B7 costimulatory molecule family. Its mRNA is widely&#xD;
      expressed in tissues, but the protein expression is limited. It is expressed in resting&#xD;
      fibroblasts, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, amniotic fluid stem cells and other non-immune&#xD;
      cells, and The surface of induced antigen-presenting cells and NK cells. Many studies have&#xD;
      revealed that B7-H3 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including melanoma, pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors, and its&#xD;
      expression level is closely related to the poor prognosis and clinical outcome of patients .&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have confirmed that the expression of CD276 mRNA in pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      tissues is significantly higher than that of normal adjacent groups.&#xD;

      Traditional treatments have limited efficacy in patients with pancreatic cancer, and&#xD;
      molecular targeted therapy also has limited benefits. According to the results of the&#xD;
      CONKO-005 clinical trial, compared with the single-agent Gemcitabine (Gemcitabine) treatment,&#xD;
      the combined use of Erlotinib (Erolotinib) did not prolong the survival time of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer patients in postoperative adjuvant treatment. However, another phase III clinical&#xD;
      result for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer found that compared with gemcitabine&#xD;
      monotherapy, the survival of patients in the combined gemcitabine and erlotinib treatment&#xD;
      group was significantly improved (6.24 months VS 5.91 months). The one-year survival rate has&#xD;
      also improved (23% VS 17%). As a result, the FDA approved the &quot;gemcitabine + erlotinib&quot;&#xD;
      combination regimen in 2005 for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      or distant metastases. However, this program only improves survival for about 10 days, making&#xD;
      it difficult for the targeted drug erlotinib to achieve greater clinical benefit in the&#xD;
      treatment of pancreatic cancer. In February 2019, the FDA approved olapa, an inhibitor that&#xD;
      targets poly-ADP ribose polymerase, for the maintenance treatment of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer who carry BRCA gene mutations, and then the population of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer who carry BRCA gene mutations The limited quantity limits the&#xD;
      scope of clinical application of olaparib. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new&#xD;
      anti-pancreatic cancer therapeutic targets.&#xD;
