      Collection of data in real life conditions on satefy, effectiveness and quality of life of&#xD;
      trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with metastatic or unresectable HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The present observational study aims to collect data on long-term safety of trastuzumab&#xD;
      deruxtecan, with a primary endpoint on trastuzumab deruxtecan related adverse drug reactions&#xD;
      (ADRs) of interest. Data on patient profile, treatment history (before, during and after&#xD;
      trastuzumab deruxtecan administration), effectiveness and health-related quality of life will&#xD;
      also be collected in a real-life setting, to confirm and complement data from clinical&#xD;
      trials. Patients will be recruited whether they have started trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment&#xD;
      or will start it at the time of inclusion, whether they were prescribed compassionate&#xD;
      trastuzumab deruxtecan or marketed Enhertu®, in order to rapidly collect a large set of data.&#xD;
