  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analogue scale (VAS) Pain score at Injection Site at Time Zero (T0)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 minute post injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Infusion site pain VAS score is a participant administered single item scale designed to measure pain using a 0-100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. Overall severity of participant's pain is indicated by placing a single mark on the horizontal 100 mm scale from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (worst possible pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analogue scale (VAS) Pain score at Injection Site after Time Zero (T0)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes post injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Infusion site pain VAS score is a participant administered single item scale designed to measure pain using a 0-100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. Overall severity of participant's pain is indicated by placing a single mark on the horizontal 100 mm scale from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (worst possible pain).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Injection Site Reactions (ISR)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 and 60 minutes post injection</time_frame>
    <description>ISR will consists of rating the severity of skin reaction at the injection site using the scores below 0=no reaction, 1= easily tolerated erythema and/or light bruising, 2= distributing erythema with swelling and/or distributing bruising, 3=almost intolerable symptoms, or clinically definite skin necrosis, characterized by any of the following: oozing, weeping, skin breakdown, ulceration, scar formation. Higher the score worst the injection site reaction.</description>
