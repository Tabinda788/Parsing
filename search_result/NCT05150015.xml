    <textblock>
      Special pumps called self-deflating Elastomeric Pumps (EMPs) will be tested for giving&#xD;
      antibiotics via a drip to hospital patients. EMPs are filled with antibiotics, attached to a&#xD;
      &quot;drip&quot; (usually in the arm) and worn on the body, slowly giving antibiotics through the day.&#xD;
      EMPs are often used to give antibiotics to patients in their own home but they have not been&#xD;
      used to treat patients in hospital before, so a small study of 10 patients will be conducted&#xD;
      to see if a full scale clinical trial is worthwhile. EMPs will be tested for ease of use and&#xD;
      safety in hospital, and to find out what staff and patients think about them. The pilot will&#xD;
      be done to see if a clinical trial would be good value for money by comparing time spent in&#xD;
      hospital, nursing time and overall cost to the NHS of the two ways of giving antibiotics to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      4 Background 4.1 Antibiotic resistance Antibiotic resistance (AMR) is when bacteria have&#xD;
      changed (mutated) so they can survive the effects of antibiotics, meaning antibiotics are&#xD;
      less effective. AMR is a major threat to health worldwide. In UK hospitals, at least a third&#xD;
      of patients are on antibiotics at any given time. Hospital patients with serious infections&#xD;
      are often given intravenous antibiotics (through a &quot;drip&quot; into a vein). Cutting down&#xD;
      unnecessary antibiotic prescribing is key to reducing resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Problems giving intravenous antibiotics Giving intravenous antibiotics takes a lot of&#xD;
      nursing time. This is made worse if antibiotics are needed more than once a day. Nurses are&#xD;
      the only staff who give intravenous antibiotics in hospitals, and there is a shortage of&#xD;
      40,000 nurses in the NHS. Because of this, it is common for doses to be missed. The COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic has increased the pressure on nurses' time. It is not always practical to give&#xD;
      antibiotics 4 or 6 times a day so less effective antibiotics may be used instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 What can be done to help? Some antibiotics work better when given slowly into a vein all&#xD;
      the time. EMPs are self-powered devices that deliver antibiotics in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMPs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are currently used to give antibiotics to patients in their own homes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are not used to give antibiotics to patients in hospitals because the safety, benefits&#xD;
           and value for money have not been confirmed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  could allow more nurse time for patient care by reducing the time to set up antibiotic&#xD;
           drips.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  could make things better for patients by allowing them to move more, sleep better,&#xD;
           recover faster and spend less time in hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Designs and methods used Patients who could have antibiotics through EMPs will be&#xD;
      identified from clinical ward rounds. EMPs will be tested for safety in hospital patients, as&#xD;
      well as value for money in the NHS by collecting information about costs, nursing time and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay. Surveys of patients and nursing staff will be conducted to explore&#xD;
      how EMPs could be best used in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Patient and public involvement (PPI) This research has been driven by patients who know&#xD;
      how difficult it is to keep mobile when attached to drip stands; how disturbed sleep from&#xD;
      drips being set up in the night affects their wellbeing; and, how they are concerned about&#xD;
      missed doses of antibiotics. The project has been designed with input from a PPI&#xD;
      representative (Co-investigator Thompson) who has reviewed all project plans and materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6 Dissemination Findings will be published in medical journals and presented at&#xD;
      conferences/NHS patient events. Social media will be used to let people know what is found&#xD;
      and infographics will be developed to help communicate findings using social media. If&#xD;
      appropriate, funding will be sought for a full trial.&#xD;
