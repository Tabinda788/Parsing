  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not&#xD;
      have contraindications. For those aged 6 months through 8 years who have previously received&#xD;
      ≥2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart, they require&#xD;
      only 1 dose of influenza vaccine. For those who have not previously received ≥2 doses of&#xD;
      trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine, they require 2 dose of influenza vaccine. but&#xD;
      the evidence on how to select vaccine doses for quadrivalent influenza vaccine is limited in&#xD;
      China. The study is a prospective, open-label comparison of the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of 1 versus 2 doses of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine in&#xD;
      subjects of 3-8 years old with different history of influenza vaccination.&#xD;

      Subjects receive 2 dosed of quadrivalent influenza vaccine 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were obtained from children at 3 time points-before receipt of dose 1, 4 weeks&#xD;
      after receipt of dose 1 and before dose 2, and 4 weeks after dose 2. Hemagglutination&#xD;
      inhibition (HAI) antibody titers to the A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and B antigens included in the&#xD;
      vaccine were measured at each time point&#xD;
