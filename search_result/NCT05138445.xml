  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with Inflammatory Arthritis (IA) experience symptoms of pain and fatigue&#xD;
      which interfere with work. Over 50% of people with IA report workplace difficulties resulting&#xD;
      in sick leave, absenteeism and reduced productivity. Loss of ability to continue paid&#xD;
      employment results in physical, emotional and financial hardship for individuals with IA and&#xD;
      has societal and economic implications. Previous research has identified pain and fatigue as&#xD;
      dominant symptoms that interfere with work capacity and therefore interventions are required&#xD;
      to reduce the impact of these symptoms on work activities. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      therefore is to test the effectiveness of a 4-week Fatigue and Activity Management Education&#xD;
      for Work intervention. The study will use a mixed methods design. A randomized control trial&#xD;
      will test the effectiveness of the intervention and a qualitative process evaluation with&#xD;
      explore acceptability and participants' experiences of the intervention. Individuals with IA,&#xD;
      of working age, will be recruited in Rheumatology outpatient departments of three hospitals.&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomly assigned to a four-week online self-management&#xD;
      intervention or a self-guided symptom management workbook. Study measures consist of&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires related to work and symptom management. All participants will also&#xD;
      be invited to an interview to discuss their experience of participating in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatic diseases (RD) include over 100 different types of arthritis, the most frequently&#xD;
      occurring being Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Scleroderma, Systemic Lupus&#xD;
      erythmatosus and ankylsoing Spondylitis. However, Inflammatory Arthritis (IA) are one of the&#xD;
      most common causes of work disability and despite improvements in medical management of IA,&#xD;
      up to 50% of people with IA report workplace difficulties resulting in sick leave,&#xD;
      absenteeism and reduced productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study builds on existing research investigating the impact of IA on work performance of&#xD;
      individuals. These earlier studies examined how symptoms of fatigue, pain and stress impact&#xD;
      on work capacity of individuals with IA. Based on the findings of these studies a&#xD;
      self-management program, FAtigue Management Education for Work (FAME-W) was designed to&#xD;
      reduce the impact of fatigue, pain and stress on work performance of individuals with IA.&#xD;
      Pilot testing of FAME-W, with a non-experimental design, showed improvements in fatigue, work&#xD;
      performance, pain and mood following participation in FAME-W. The proposed study will build&#xD;
      on this research by testing the effectiveness of FAME-W as a work-focused self-management&#xD;
      intervention to increase work performance of individuals with IA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Design and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and acceptability of FAME-W to manage&#xD;
      the physical, mental and social demands of work of individuals with IA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the effectiveness of FAME-W in reducing the impact of fatigue, pain and stress&#xD;
           on work performance of individuals with Inflammatory Arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the effectiveness of FAME-W in improving work ability of individuals with&#xD;
           Inflammatory Arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the acceptability of FAME-W as a work-based self-management intervention for&#xD;
           individuals with Inflammatory Arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study methodology will follow the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) framework&#xD;
      for evaluating complex interventions. A complex intervention consists of a number of&#xD;
      interacting components such as those included in the FAME-W intervention. The MRC framework&#xD;
      recommends collecting quantitative and qualitative data when evaluating complex&#xD;
      interventions. This study will therefore use a sequential exploratory mixed methods design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative phase will be a pragmatic randomized control trial (RCT) to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of FAME-W as a work focused self-management intervention to improve&#xD;
      individuals' ability to manage their work demands. The CONSORT guidelines for the design and&#xD;
      reporting of RCTs will be used at all stages from recruitment, randomization, data&#xD;
      collection, analysis and reporting. For the purposes of the proposed study, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to either the group based FAME-W intervention or to a handbook only&#xD;
      group. Participants randomized to the group-based FAME-W group will attend an online&#xD;
      four-week FAME-W program. The participants in handbook only group will be given a self-guided&#xD;
      FAME-W handbook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative phase will use a Qualitative Descriptive (QD) design to explore participants'&#xD;
      experiences and acceptability of FAME-W. QD is frequently used in health research to evaluate&#xD;
      the acceptability and sustainability of health-related interventions. It is considered an&#xD;
      appropriate methodology for needs assessments and for informing the planning and delivery of&#xD;
      clinical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous studies the individual scores for Work Role Functioning (WRF)&#xD;
      questionnaire this study is powered for an effect size of 0.7. To detect an 0.7, 100&#xD;
      participants are required (50 for the group intervention and 50 for handbook only group) to&#xD;
      show significance at 5% level, 80% power. Participants will be recruited in groups of 12-14&#xD;
      and then allocated to the intervention or control group using random allocation software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS, outlined below) will be used to collect&#xD;
      quantitative data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative phase: Qualitative data will be collected from individual interviews and focus&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be carried out immediately before FAME-W commences, immediately&#xD;
      following completion of FAME-W, and 3 months following completion of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Quantitative data: Baseline characteristics will be analyzed using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. Multilevel linear regression will be used to examine differences between groups&#xD;
      for the primary and secondary outcome measures. Statistical significance at p&lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      assumed throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data: Semi-structured interviews will be audio-taped and transcribed. Data&#xD;
      analysis will be guided by Braun and Clarke's seven stage thematic analysis of qualitative&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

    <measure>Work Role Functioning Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Work Role Functioning questionnaire is a 27-self-report questionnaire that measures an individual's ability to meet demands of five categories of work: scheduling, output, psychical, mental and social demands. All 27 items are scored on a five point scale, with a score of four given for the response 'difficult none of the time' and a score of zero representing 'difficult all of the time'. Each of the five sub-scales are scored separately. A score is established by adding the response of each item, calculating the average and multiplying this by 25 to achieve an overall percentage. The overall percent can range from 0% (difficult all of the time), to 100% (never difficult) meeting the demands of the job.</description>
