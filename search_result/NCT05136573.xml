      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer is one of the biggest global health threats. The incidence and mortality of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (CRC) are increasing. The treatment of CRC is mainly surgical resection, and the&#xD;
      standard treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is Oxaliplatin chemotherapy, which is&#xD;
      mainly a platinum agent (Alkylating agent). Oxaliplatin can exert its anti-cancer therapeutic&#xD;
      effect by binding to cell DNA, and become toxic to neurons, damaging large and small fibers&#xD;
      outside the brain and spinal cord. Causes peripheral neuropathy, which seriously affects the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients. The purpose to develop the interventional and investigate&#xD;
      intervention by exercise program of CRC patients with regard to the improvement effect of&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy, fatigue and quality of life during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental study designs were used, and samples were taken from a regional teaching&#xD;
      hospital. The control group received routine care and maintenance of general daily&#xD;
      activities; the experimental group received routine care and maintenance of general daily&#xD;
      activities, and also received combined exercises, balance training and resistance exercises&#xD;
      twice a week, 60 minutes each time, plus weekly 5 walking exercises, 30 minutes each time,&#xD;
      for a total of 12 weeks, of which the exercise training during chemotherapy and&#xD;
      hospitalization is performed under the supervision of the investigator, and 1 balance&#xD;
      training and resistance exercise are performed for 60 minutes each time to ensure that the&#xD;
      patient performs. The correctness and safety of exercises, and balance training and&#xD;
      resistance exercises in combination with the home style. During the home exercises, the&#xD;
      researchers will give weekly telephone interviews to understand the patient's exercise&#xD;
      status, and indeed achieve the balance training and resistance exercises twice a week. All&#xD;
      measurement tools and methods are implemented in accordance with consistent standard&#xD;
      operations. The control group took pre-tests when the case was closed, without interventional&#xD;
      measures, but also performed post-tests in the same way as the experimental group at 6 weeks,&#xD;
      8 weeks, 10 weeks, and 12 weeks in the interventional experimental group.&#xD;
