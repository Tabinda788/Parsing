  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the definition of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), ovarian clear&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a less common subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) . The&#xD;
      preliminary trial ANNIE (NCT04376073) shows a promising efficacy and safety profile for the&#xD;
      ANNIE combo (anlotinib+niraparib). There is limited progress in targeted therapy for those&#xD;
      less common ovarian cancers. In this study (CC-ANNIE), we aim to evaluate the antitumor&#xD;
      activity and safety of niraparib combined with anlotinib in patients with platinum-resistant&#xD;
      or platinum-refractory OCCC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CC-ANNIE trial is a single-arm, single-center, exploratory phase II trial. Eligible&#xD;
      patients (≥18 &amp; ≤70 years) are histologically confirmed platinum-resistant recurrent OCCC and&#xD;
      20 subjects are planned to be enrolled. All subjects must have measurable lesions (according&#xD;
      to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) and are going to be treated&#xD;
      with niraparib 200mg once daily, anlotinib 10mg on day 1-14 of each 21-day cycle thereafter&#xD;
      until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint is the objective&#xD;
      response rate.&#xD;
