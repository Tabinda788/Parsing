    <textblock>
      Purpose and significance:With the increasing incidence of Diabetes mellitus (DM), the&#xD;
      incidence rate of Diabetic Foot (DF) is raised. DF is a foot infection, ulceration and / or&#xD;
      deep tissue destruction caused by nerve abnormalities and varying degrees of vascular lesions&#xD;
      in DM patients. The high incidence, disability and mortality rate of DF make it urgent to&#xD;
      explore new ways to improve the cure rate, reduce the burden and elevate the quality of life.&#xD;
      Previous studies have confirmed that traditional Miao ethic medicine Tangningtongluo(TNTL)&#xD;
      can improve the remission rate of diabetes mellitus and diabetic foot disease, but the&#xD;
      clinical research evidence is not sufficient. This study aims to provide effective clinical&#xD;
      evidence for the treatment of diabetic foot patients with TNTL by observing growth rate of&#xD;
      wound, prognosis and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: From September 2021 to March 2023, a total of 80 diabetic foot ulcer patients&#xD;
      admitted to Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong&#xD;
      University were recruited. Participants are randomized in a ratio of 1: 1: 1:1 into four&#xD;
      treatment groups of 20 participants: (i) standardized western medicine treatment group, (ii)&#xD;
      standardized western medicine treatment+TNTL tablet+TNTL cream group , (iii) standardized&#xD;
      western medicine treatment+TNTL tablet group, and (iiii) standardized western medicine&#xD;
      treatment+TNTL cream group. Treatment with TNTL tablets: the oral administration of TNTL&#xD;
      tablets, 4 tablets each time, 3 times a day. Treatment with TNTL cream: topical application&#xD;
      of sterile TNTL cream on the wound surface, the dressing is continuously changed according to&#xD;
      the wound healing. Anthropometric parameters, serum biochemical index, glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin, urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio, islet-specific autoantibodies(ISAs), fat&#xD;
      mass, and islet β-cell function were measured. The healing stage of the wound surface and the&#xD;
      growth degree of granulation tissue were graded, and the time required for wound repairing to&#xD;
      each healing stage was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: randomized controlled, prospective,intervention study.&#xD;
