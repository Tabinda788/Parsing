      This study was conducted to investigate the effect of High intensity laser therapy( HILT) on&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold, serum cortisol level, passive knee range of motion, and changes of&#xD;
      functional disability in patients with active myofascial trigger points(MTrPs) pain&#xD;
      associated wit knee osteoarthritis(OA) .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of musculoskeletal pain and disability. It is a&#xD;
      chronic degenerative disorder of multifactorial etiology, including acute and/or chronic&#xD;
      insults from normal wear and tear, age, obesity and joint injury. The true pathogenesis&#xD;
      remains poorly understood. OA is characterized by a degradation of the articular cartilage,&#xD;
      resulting in an alteration of its biomechanical properties, which in turn contributes to a&#xD;
      focal loss of articular cartilage, loss of joint space, osteophyte formation, focal areas of&#xD;
      synovitis, per articular bone remodeling and sub chondral cysts , OA presents with symptoms&#xD;
      such as joint pain, stiffness, motion limitations, motor and sensory dysfunction and&#xD;
      functional impairments, thus, preventing patients from participating in regular physical&#xD;
      activities , The common sites of OA appear on the knees, hands, and hips, whereas knee OA is&#xD;
      the most common .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is the most frequent complaint for patients with knee OA to seek medical attention. If&#xD;
      left untreated, pain and stiffness can result in a loss of physical function and independence&#xD;
      during daily activities. The presence of OA-related knee pain has also been associated with&#xD;
      increased risks of physical disability in the community .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have revealed a discrepancy between patients' reports of pain and their&#xD;
      radiographic findings , a plausible option is that the pain originates from the myofascial&#xD;
      trigger points (MTrPs) in the surrounding muscles (myofascial pain) and cannot be visualized&#xD;
      by imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term myofascial pain is defined as &quot;the complex of sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms&#xD;
      caused by MTrPs , MTrPs, hyperirritable spots found in the skeletal muscles, are associated&#xD;
      with hypersensitive palpable nodules located in a taut band. The spots are painful on&#xD;
      compression and may produce characteristic referred pain, referred tenderness, motor&#xD;
      dysfunction, and autonomic phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All studies found a high prevalence of myofascial pain in knee OA patients . study of OA&#xD;
      patients, MTrPs were found in all participants, especially in the medial head of the&#xD;
      gastrocnemius (92%) and the vastus medialis muscle (67%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of MPS includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In activation of trigger points, relaxation of taut bands, and breaking the&#xD;
      pain-spasm-ischemia-pain cycle. The most widely used treatment methods for MPS are education,&#xD;
      exercise, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), superficial and deep heat,&#xD;
      electrotherapy, laser therapy, and local injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser treatment :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is non- invasive and painless and can be easily administered in therapy units for a wide&#xD;
      range of conditions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) was introduced to the field of physical&#xD;
      therapy. The advantage of HILT over Low level laser therapy(LLLT) is that HILT is able to&#xD;
      reach and stimulate the large and/or deep joints that are difficult to reach in LLLT .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of HILT has been proven to significantly reduce pain . Previous studies describe the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, anti-edematous, and analgesic effects of HILT, thus justifying its use in&#xD;
      the therapy of pain .&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Intensity: change of serum cortisol level was used in many research as pain blood biomarker</measure>
    <time_frame>The first sample was obtained before the first day of treatment and the second sample was obtained after 4 weeks (1 month) of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For measuring serum cortisol level, Each patient was drawn two 5 ml blood samples from cubital vein two times.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain threshold: The Commander Algometer (JTECH Medical, Midvale, Utah, USA) was used to measure the PPT.</measure>
    <time_frame>The first measure was obtained before the first day's treatment and the second measure was obtained after 4 weeks of treatment (1 month).</time_frame>
    <description>It's a hand-held tool that uses manual pressure to test pain sensitivity in deeper structures. It's a valid tool that's been widely used. The algometer's tip was positioned on the trigger area, and pressure was increased at a rate of 1 kg per second.&#xD;
When the patient expressed discomfort and verified it verbally, the pressure measurement was recorded as kg/cm2, the technique was done three times at 60-second intervals and the average was taken .</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Function: knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score ( KOOS )Score was used to measure the changes of functional disability.</measure>
    <time_frame>The first score was taken before the first day's treatment and the second score was taken after 4 weeks of treatment (1 month).</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is a valid, and reliable questionnaire used for assessing the functional status and quality of life (QoL) of patients with any type of knee injuries and osteoarthritis .It assesses five outcomes: pain , symptoms , activities of daily living , sport and recreation function and knee related quality of life . It is a 42-itemself-reported, joint-specific questionnaire which comprises five subscales: Pain (nine items), Symptoms (seven items), Activities of daily life (ADL) (17 items), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec) (five items) and Knee-related quality of life (QoL) (four items). Each item is scored from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems). For each subscale, the score was normalized to a 0-100 scale with higher scores indicating better status.</description>
