  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An accumulating body of evidence has shown that detection and resection of pre-cancerous&#xD;
      adenoma by colonoscopy could effectively prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) and its related&#xD;
      mortality. Among various colonoscopy quality indicators, such as cecal intubation rate,&#xD;
      withdrawal time, and adenoma detection rate (ADR), ADR is the most important one and most&#xD;
      closely associated with the subsequent risk of CRC. A recent study further demonstrated the&#xD;
      improvement of ADR could reduce subsequent risk of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be noted, among all colorectal neoplasm, non-polypoid lesions, such as flat or depressed&#xD;
      lesions, carries higher likelihood to be overlooked during conventional colonoscopy and these&#xD;
      overlooked lesions were the main etiology of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer (PCCRC).&#xD;
      Nowadays, several colonoscopy technologies had been developed to enhance the detection of&#xD;
      colorectal adenoma such as using digital or dye-spray chromoendoscopy or add-on device such&#xD;
      as Cap-assisted endoscopy. Among them, some had showed the potential to enhance the detection&#xD;
      of non-polypoid lesion, for example, the next-generation NBI or iSCAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D endoscopy is a new technology that using image processing technique to offer more&#xD;
      information on tissue depth in comparison with conventional 2D endoscopy. The utility of 3D&#xD;
      endoscopy on GI tract was mainly from upper GI tract and it was proved to enhance the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy on superficial gastric tumors and shortened the procedure time during&#xD;
      performing gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD). However, few is known that whether&#xD;
      3D colonoscopy could enhance the adenoma detection, especially for non-polypoid lesion&#xD;
      detection, during colonoscopy examination. Therefore, this prospective, randomized control&#xD;
      study is aim to demonstrate the efficacy of 3D colonoscopy on adenoma detection in comparison&#xD;
      with conventional 2D colonoscopy.&#xD;

Subjects in 3D colonoscopy arm:&#xD;
Colonoscopist will switch the image to 3D imaging form and wearing special glasses to enhance the 3D imaging. The 3D mode will be maintained during the whole colonoscopy withdrawal. When encountering suspicious neoplasm, the colonoscopist can use any image-enhancing technique (such as NBI or indigo carmine dye) to assist the diagnosis and use standard resection procedure (such as polypectomy) to complete lesion resection if necessary. The procedure time, withdrawal time, adenoma detection rate will be recorded during the colonoscopy. The pathology specimen will be sent for histology examination and any adverse event after colonoscopy (such as bleeding or perforation) will be recorded after routine surveillance.</description>
