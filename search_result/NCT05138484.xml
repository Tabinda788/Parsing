  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: For centuries, plants (and / or their products) were the only resource available&#xD;
      for the prevention and treatment of many diseases. However, its indiscriminate use without&#xD;
      phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological knowledge is a concern for health. The Malva&#xD;
      sylvestris (family Malvaceae and popularly known as Malva) is mentioned in the literature as&#xD;
      an ethnopharmacological medicine with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, wound healing and&#xD;
      other properties. For this reason, M. sylvestris presents empirical indications in dentistry,&#xD;
      mainly in the treatment of periodontal diseases (gingivitis and periodontitis), which are&#xD;
      highly prevalent worldwide. However, scientific evidence is scarce in information that&#xD;
      supports the biological properties and clinical benefits attributed to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a mouthwash based on&#xD;
      Malva sylvestris in the control of gingival inflammation and dental biofilm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized, three-group, triple-masked clinical trial was designed. Patients from&#xD;
      the Center of Dental Clinics of the Austral University of Chile participated with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of gingivitis and chronic periodontitis. They were distributed randomly in three study&#xD;
      groups: 1. Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.12%; 2. Mouthwash with extract of M. sylvestris and 3.&#xD;
      Mouthwash control group. The indications and dosage were identical for all groups: rinse with&#xD;
      10 ml, for 1 minute, every 12 hours for 7 days. The gingival index and plaque control record&#xD;
      were recorded at the beginning and end of the follow-up period (7 days). The results obtained&#xD;
      between the groups were compared through normality test and group analysis&#xD;
      (ANOVA/Mann-Whitney/Dunnet p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The pharmacological potential of M. sylvestris was determined in the reduction of&#xD;
      the plaque control record and gingival index.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It´s designed a randomized clinical trial of three parallel groups, triple masking. The study&#xD;
      and informed consent document were reviewed and approved by the Comité Ético Científico of&#xD;
      Servicio de Salud Valdivia (ORD 181/2017) and written according to the CONSORT (EQUATOR&#xD;
      Network) writing guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were selected from the Department of Oral and Periodontal Surgery of the&#xD;
      Dental Clinic Center of the Universidad Austral de Chile (UACh) (Valdivia, southern Chile)&#xD;
      during the months of October 2017 to December 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the sample size, the effectiveness of the use of CHX mouthwash was&#xD;
      considered over placebo, a standardized mean in the reduction of the gingival index according&#xD;
      to Loe &amp; Silness (1963) parameters of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.1-0.31) (15). Probability of error of&#xD;
      5%, statistical power of 80% and margin of loss of follow-up or absence of data of 20%. The&#xD;
      participation of 18 subjects was determined by study group (calculation algorithm: &quot;power two&#xD;
      means 1.21 1, sd1 (0.2) sd2 (0.2) knowns&quot;, STATA V.14.0, STATASp, Texas, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of M. sylvestris extract and mouthwash:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the preparation of the mouthwash of M. sylvestris, the leaves registered in the herbarium&#xD;
      of the University of Sao Paulo (USP) were used. Identification number ESA voucher # 121403.&#xD;
      The leaves were dried in a forced circulation oven for 24 h, at 40 °C, and then crushed. The&#xD;
      extraction was carried out with absolute ethanol under climatic control (25 °C) and subjected&#xD;
      to exhaustive extraction (7 days) in a rotating shaker protected against light. In the&#xD;
      extraction sequence, the samples were filtered, concentrated by evaporation and lyophilized&#xD;
      for 72 h. The EEM was stored at -20 °C. The chemical monitoring was conducted by HPLC MS/MS&#xD;
      technique (33). The mouthwash based on M. sylvestris was prepared at a standard concentration&#xD;
      of 10% using a 1% ethanol vehicle for preservation of compounds at a concentration compatible&#xD;
      with morphofunctional stability (32,33). The control mouthwash presents the same vehicle and&#xD;
      composition as the previous one but is exempted from the active compound and the CHX&#xD;
      mouthwash was prepared at a concentration of 0.12% with the same vehicle as an accentuated at&#xD;
      a concentration of 0.12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal indices record:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the clinical trial, two examiners (E.A and A.N) underwent a calibration process for&#xD;
      the registration of clinical indices (BPE, gingival index and plaque control record) with a&#xD;
      specialist in periodontics. To this end, 10 patients from the Center of Dental Clinics of the&#xD;
      UACh were evaluated, diagnosed by the specialist with gingival index (GI) over 90% and&#xD;
      moderate chronic periodontitis in one of their dental sextants. Inter-examiner and&#xD;
      intra-examiner kappa index of 0.89 and 0.80, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective and methodology of the study were explained to the patients who fulfilled the&#xD;
      selection criteria and who had already been previously diagnosed. Those who agreed to&#xD;
      participate, signed an informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the appointment, the examiners, confirmed the fulfillment of the selection&#xD;
      criteria and recorded the data: sex, age, hygiene habits, systemic diseases, use of drugs and&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then we proceeded to the clinical examination and the following indices were evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic Periodontal Examination (BPE): The mouth is divided into sextants and using a&#xD;
           WHO-standardized periodontal probe, the probing of each tooth is performed in 3 points&#xD;
           (mesial, medial and distal) by vestibular and lingual-palatal of each tooth, registering&#xD;
           the highest value per sextant, according to the following coding: 0 (healthy tissue), 1&#xD;
           (positive bleeding, absence of periodontal pocket), 2 (presence of tartar, defective&#xD;
           fillings, black area of the probe completely visible), 3 (periodontal pocket greater&#xD;
           than 5.5 mm) (35).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gingival Index (GI): With a WHO-standardized periodontal probe, the buccal, lingual and&#xD;
           interdental papillae marginal gingival are probed, using a four-point scale from 0&#xD;
           (absence of inflammation) to 3 (severe inflammation) (37,38).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque control record (PC): 5 drops of Plaque Revealing Solution are applied, and the&#xD;
           patient is instructed to make movements with the tongue in such a way that it touches&#xD;
           all dental surfaces in a time of 15 seconds. The vestibular, lingual and interproximal&#xD;
           surfaces of all the teeth are then examined. To calculate the index, add the total&#xD;
           number of dental surfaces with plaque, divide this number by the total number of&#xD;
           surfaces present in the mouth and multiply by 100 (39).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and use of mouthwash:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization and masked identification of the mouthwashes was done by a single&#xD;
      researcher (B.B.). All mouthwashes were dispensed in a 150 mL white vial and each content was&#xD;
      identified by a different colored marker known only to the investigator in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the randomization of each patient within the three groups, the page&#xD;
      www.random.org was used, with the numbers 1,2 or 3 corresponding to the groups G1, G2 and G3,&#xD;
      respectively, being returned as a result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, the patients were randomized into 3 parallel study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G1 (Green): Positive Control (0.12% CHX)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G2 (Orange): Negative control (alcohol vehicle mouthwash 0.1%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G3 (Yellow): Experimental group (10% mouthwash of M. sylvestris extract). After the&#xD;
           clinical examination, another researcher (V.Ll.) recorded in each clinical record the&#xD;
           patient's coding assigned by number, group and color. He delivered the bottle and&#xD;
           posology to each patient corresponding to the randomized group, having to rinse with 10&#xD;
           ml of mouthwash for 1 minute in the mouth, every 12 h for 7 days. To confirm the&#xD;
           follow-up of the intervention, the same researcher made telephone calls at least once a&#xD;
           day to remember the daily rinse. The instructions were delivered verbally and in&#xD;
           writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The re-evaluation of the patients was carried out 7 days after the first appointment, by the&#xD;
      same examiner registering the PBE, GI and PC indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of risk of bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The masking mechanisms through coding by number, group and color, ensured that the patients&#xD;
      did not know the specific mouthwash they received; examiners E.A and A.N were limited only to&#xD;
      assessing clinical aspects and data analysis was performed with the database using numerical&#xD;
      coding. Only researcher B.B was aware of the real assignment by color, with its corresponding&#xD;
      study group and number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To control the risk of random bias in the changes of hygiene habits of the participants on&#xD;
      the registration of the periodontal indices, the frequency of brushing, type of toothpaste&#xD;
      and use of oral antiseptic mouthwashes was registered; indicating to each participant to&#xD;
      maintain these habits without needing to change the oral hygiene frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mouthwash study groups were defined as an independent variable. The PC and GI analyzed at the&#xD;
      beginning and 7 days after the intervention of the study were defined as dependent variable.&#xD;
      An analysis of descriptive statistics of the following data was performed: sex (male/female),&#xD;
      age (in years), frequency of brushing/day, smoking (smokes over 10 cigarettes/day), presence&#xD;
      of chronic disease (Yes/No) and medication consumption (Yes/No). In addition, the values of&#xD;
      PC and GI. The continuous variables were presented as average values (Standard Deviation -&#xD;
      SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the analytical statistics, the normality of the data was analyzed by the Shapiro Wilk test&#xD;
      (p&gt; 0.05). To compare the indices between the 3 groups before and after the intervention, the&#xD;
      data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA (MR). The nonparametric data were presented as&#xD;
      scatter plot of the samples, comparison with T-test to detect differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the variability of the initial data of the patients belonging to each study group&#xD;
      that can generate a result bias, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the baseline data was&#xD;
      performed. To check the study hypotheses, the mean values were compared, with a 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval of the results between study groups, establishing a level of significance&#xD;
      of p &lt;0.05&#xD;
