  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility pilot study is designed to learn whether patients and their care partners&#xD;
      (e.g., family members) are willing and able to complete two study visits at Dartmouth College&#xD;
      while receiving cancer care at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A feasibility pilot open label, single-arm observational case series of 10 patients with&#xD;
      metastatic gastrointestinal and lung cancer patients and 10 care partners. Participants will&#xD;
      complete two study visits, separated by approximately 8-16 weeks of usual oncologic care with&#xD;
      early integrated specialty palliative care. The palliative care physician will also be a&#xD;
      study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To develop and refine study procedures which can be used in future&#xD;
      research in order to further understanding of the mechanisms of action of specialty&#xD;
      palliative. Expected products: manual of operating procedures and web-based data collection&#xD;
      forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To test the feasibility of conducting a mechanism-focused clinical&#xD;
      trial of primary palliative care vs. specialty palliative care for advanced cancer patients&#xD;
      and their care partners. Expected products: preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of&#xD;
      study procedures sufficient to prove this study design is possible.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient: has received a diagnosis of metastatic lung or gastrointestinal cancer within&#xD;
             the last 8 weeks *(note: most metastatic GI cancer will likely be pancreatic or&#xD;
             colorectal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Care partner: care partner of a patient who has received a diagnosis of metastatic&#xD;
             lung or gastrointestinal cancer who has provided consent for study (either with our&#xD;
             without functional MRI study visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to understand study requirements and make an informed decision to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to speak and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &lt;8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to MRI (e.g.: implanted or embedded metal/metal fragments. Metals in&#xD;
             the body make the participant unable to undergo an MRI which makes them ineligible for&#xD;
             study participation).&#xD;
