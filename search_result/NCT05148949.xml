  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled study, for evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of three doses of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac) in pulmonary&#xD;
      tuberculosis patients aged 18-75 years. 200 tuberculosis patients and 40 healthy adults aged&#xD;
      18-75 years will be recruited in this study. Of them, 200 pulmonary tuberculosis patients&#xD;
      will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of standard dosage CoronaVac plus one&#xD;
      dose of double dosage CoronaVac or two doses of standard dosage CoronaVac plus one dose of&#xD;
      standard dosage CoronaVac at a schedule of 0, 28, 56 days, respectively. Other 40 healthy&#xD;
      subjects served as an external control group will be vaccinated with two doses of standard&#xD;
      dosage CoronaVac at a schedule of 0, 28 days. The occurrence of adverse events within 28 days&#xD;
      after each dose vaccination and serious adverse events within 3 months after full vaccination&#xD;
      will be observed. In addition, blood samples will be collected on day 0 before the first dose&#xD;
      and 28 days and 3 months after the last dose vaccination in all participants and 28 days&#xD;
      after second dose in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Each subject will remain in this study&#xD;
      for 5 months (healthy group) or 6 months (tuberculosis group).&#xD;
