      After written consent from next-of-kin patients with severe traumatic brain injury was&#xD;
      included from the neurointensive care unit (NICU) at Sahlgrenska university hospital,&#xD;
      Gothenburg. Blood and CSF samples were collected during the initial 3 weeks after trauma. 1&#xD;
      year after trauma patients were assessed according to Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), NIHSS and&#xD;
      Barthels. 10-15 years after trauma a repeated evaluation according to GOS was performed by&#xD;
      telephone. Different biomarkers such as Neurofilament light, Glial fibrillary acidic protein&#xD;
      and Tau among others, was analyzed from serum and CSF samples. Further patients were explored&#xD;
      Apolipoprotein-E genetype (APOE). The investigators hypothesize that higher biomarkers&#xD;
      concentrations and positive test for this gene relate to worse outcome 1-year and 10-15 years&#xD;
      after trauma. Further that these biomarkers and genetic marker further have prognostic value&#xD;
      on outcome 1-year and 10-15 years after trauma. Finally, the investigators want to explore&#xD;
      the concentrations dynamics of these biomarkers in serum and CSF in the acute phase after&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;

      Patients with a severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) were included after written consent from&#xD;
      next-to kin. The injury was considered as severe if having a Glasgow coma scale of 8 or less.&#xD;
      Within 48h of trauma patients were included from the neurointensive care unit at Sahlgrenska&#xD;
      university hospital, Gothenburg during 2000-2004. Patients were intubated and had a&#xD;
      ventricular catheter. All patients were treated in accordance with the Lund Concept. Samples&#xD;
      from ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood was collected, during the first 3 weeks,&#xD;
      then prepared for storage and later analyzed. Samples were stored in -70 degrees Celsius&#xD;
      until analyzed. 1 year after trauma patients were assessed according to Glasgow outcome scale&#xD;
      (GOS), NIHSS and Barthels Index. 10-15 years after trauma an evaluation of GOS by phone was&#xD;
      repeated. Biomarkers such as Neurofilament light, Glial fibrillary acidic protein, Tau among&#xD;
      others is analyzed in serum and CSF. Further, patients APOE genotype was explored. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesizes that higher concentrations of these biomarkers both in serum and&#xD;
      CSF relate to worse 1-year and 10-15 year outcome after a severe traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
      Further, patients that have the gene APOE4 is predisposed to worse 1 year and 10-15 year&#xD;
      outcome after a sTBI. The investigators further want to explore the dynamics of these&#xD;
      biomarkers in serum and CSF in the acute phase after trauma and if these biomarkers gave any&#xD;
      prognostic value to on outcome (mortality and functional) 1-year and 10-15 years after&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;
