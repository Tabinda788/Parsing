  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to assess the safety and feasibility of administering&#xD;
      pre-manufactured allogeneic T cells from healthy donors expressing CD19-targeting chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptors lacking expression of HLA class I, HLA class II molecules and endogenous&#xD;
      TCR through CRISPR-mediated genome-editing of beta-2 microglobulin, CIITA and T cell receptor&#xD;
      alpha chain, respectively. These cells are called PACE CART19 cells.&#xD;
