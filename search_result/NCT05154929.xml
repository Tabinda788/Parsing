  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is enrolling eligible participants that have high blood pressure. Reducing dietary&#xD;
      salt intake and engaging in regular physical activity is known to decrease blood pressure in&#xD;
      people with hypertension. This trial will determine whether a smartwatch and a mobile health&#xD;
      application, which together deliver notifications, can increase activity levels and reduce&#xD;
      salt intake for people with high blood pressure. All study activities will be completed&#xD;
      online or via a mobile medical application. Participants will not have any face-to-face&#xD;
      visits with the study team.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a multicenter 6 month randomized controlled clinical trial. This study will investigate the efficacy of two just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) delivered via a mobile app for patients with hypertension. Eligible participants will be randomized to the two JITAIs or control in a 1:1 manner stratified by site. There will be two sites: the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor and the Hamilton Community Health Network Clinic in Flint.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will be provided a smartwatch and home blood pressure monitor. They will also be provided with general instructions on how to download and install a physical activity and diet regulation applications (apps) available to the general public. They will still be asked to perform the blood pressure monitoring at regularly scheduled time periods, but do not receive the intervention components notifications in myBPmyLife app developed for the experimental group.</description>

    <description>Participants in the experimental group will be provided a smarthwatch and home blood pressure monitor. They will then receive the myBPmyLife app that includes push notifications to promote increased physical activity and improve low sodium food choices. The app also provides goal setting for weekly step count and information on low-sodium food choices, as well as feedback on achieving the goals using a dashboard with visualization tools within the mobile application.</description>

    <description>A Fitbit smartwatch and home blood pressure monitor will be mailed to participants (in both the experimental and control arms). Participants in the intervention arm then will set up and utilize the myBPmyLife app. This app includes push notifications to promote increased physical activity and improve low-sodium food choices, establish goal setting for weekly step count and low sodium food choices, and deliver feedback on achieving the goals using a dashboard visualization within the mobile application.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the myBPmyLife app, a smartwatch, and blood pressure cuff. The myBPmyLife app will not be fully activated (as they are in the control arm). They will be provided with the option of downloading and installing a mHealth app that is publicly available. In this arm they will also perform the blood pressure monitoring, but do not receive the intervention components through the myBPmyLife app.</description>
