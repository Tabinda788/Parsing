  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which patient data from the past on men with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-sensitive prostate cancer is studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is a type of advanced prostate cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other parts of the body, and still responds to treatment that lowers&#xD;
      testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer is a condition in which the body cannot control the growth of cells. The extra cells&#xD;
      can form tumors in organs or other parts of the body. If tumors form in the prostate, male&#xD;
      hormones (androgens) can sometimes help the cancer spread and grow. The main hormone that&#xD;
      does this is called testosterone and is mainly made in the testicles. Men with prostate&#xD;
      cancer can have treatments to try to lower the levels of testosterone in the body. One&#xD;
      possible treatment is surgery to remove the testicles. Another option is taking treatments to&#xD;
      lower the levels of testosterone in the body. These are called androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
      (ADT). In men with mCSPC, ADT can help to stop the cancer from growing and spreading. Men&#xD;
      with mCSPC can also receive &quot;treatment intensification&quot;. This means that they receive ADT as&#xD;
      well as other treatments for their prostate cancer. Other studies that looked at treatment of&#xD;
      mCSPC in Canada have found that most men with mCSPC do not receive treatment intensification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to collect more data about the men who had mCSPC and the&#xD;
      types of treatment they received for their mCSPC. The researchers will look at the health&#xD;
      information of adult men in Alberta, Canada who had at least 1 dose of treatment for their&#xD;
      mCSPC between January 2016 and December 2020 or earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will first look at the health information of men whose cancer had metastasized or&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body, beyond the prostate, at the time they were diagnosed with&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And later, if feasible to do, the study may also look at the health information from men who&#xD;
      were diagnosed with prostate cancer that was limited to the prostate, and over time spread to&#xD;
      other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will collect information from databases, a census, and pharmacy records. This&#xD;
      will help the researchers learn more about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether the men received ADT alone, or ADT with treatment intensification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  additional information about the men, including their age, income, level of education,&#xD;
           residential area (urban or rural) and the more information about the treatments received&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how the men's symptoms affected their daily lives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how severe the men's cancer was&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in laboratory values as markers for changes to the blood, liver, kidney, bone or&#xD;
           other organs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  need for additional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  where the men's cancer may have spread to in other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no required visits with a study doctor or required tests in this study since&#xD;
      it's reviewing patient data from the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will collect this information for about 7 months. The entire study will take&#xD;
      about 10 months to finish.&#xD;

        The study will include all mCSPC patients in the province of Alberta that initiated and&#xD;
        received at least one dose of guideline recommended life-prolonging therapy for mCSPC&#xD;
        (docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or ADT alone) from 01-Jan-2016 up to&#xD;
        31-Dec-2020 or earlier based on database cutoff, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with de novo metastatic disease are easily identifiable by diagnosis with&#xD;
        metastatic disease. Patients who relapse with metastatic disease may be more challenging to&#xD;
        identify. The study will start by reporting on results for de novo mCSPC patients only&#xD;
        while feasibility assessment is done to determine if these patients can be identified, and&#xD;
        if so, they will be added to the study population.&#xD;
