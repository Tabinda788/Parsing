  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research project will be to obtain feedback from consumers to help&#xD;
      develop a manual called I-DREM (Innovative Development of Research Engagement Manual). The&#xD;
      researchers hope to learn information from the consented participants to help map out&#xD;
      solutions to improve recruitment of African American/Black individuals into Substance Abuse&#xD;
      Disorder (SUD) clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Black individuals represent 12% of the U.S. population. Approximately 3% participate in&#xD;
      various clinical trials in the entire country. Black individuals are disproportionately&#xD;
      affected by substance use and have higher rates of associated mortality, suggesting the need&#xD;
      for action to address this racial disparity in health outcomes. Under-representation of&#xD;
      ethnic minorities in clinical trials has significant scientific implications and ultimately&#xD;
      compromises generalizability of research findings and further exacerbates existing racial&#xD;
      health disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although incremental progress has occurred since the establishment of the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH) Revitalization Act, barriers that influence participation of the African&#xD;
      American and ethnic minority populations in research continue to exist. The NIH has&#xD;
      acknowledged the need for increased enrollment of ethnic minorities in research, yet minority&#xD;
      enrollment into clinical and translational research remains low. There are no concrete&#xD;
      developments (e.g., protocols, toolbox) to aid clinical researchers' effort to enhance&#xD;
      recruitment and retention to date in substance using populations despite the detrimental&#xD;
      disproportionate effects of substance use observed in the African American and or Black&#xD;
      populations. This suggests the importance of initiating more innovative ways of retainment,&#xD;
      recruitment, and education of ethnic minorities about Substance Use Disorders (SUDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, almost 1 million Americans, an estimated 977,000, met criteria for cocaine use&#xD;
      disorder in 2018. The rate of overdose deaths attributed to cocaine increased by an average&#xD;
      of 27% each year from 2012 to 2018, reaching a rate of 4.5 deaths per 100,000 standard&#xD;
      population in 2018. This increase is a tripling in deaths from the year 2012 to 2018 and&#xD;
      appears to be continuing to increase. The rate of death is highest among non-Hispanic Blacks&#xD;
      at a rate of 8.3 per 100,000 population, which is nearly double the rate of death attributed&#xD;
      to cocaine among non-Hispanic Whites. This differential death rate is seen despite similar&#xD;
      rates of cocaine use among Blacks and Whites is 1.8 % versus 2.1%, respectively in 2018,&#xD;
      suggesting the need for action to address this racial disparity in health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Nearly 40% of Americans belong to a racial or ethnic minority group. However,&#xD;
      participants in clinical trials for new pharmacotherapies skew heavily Caucasian. In the area&#xD;
      of substance use disorders, Blacks are also disproportionally affected and have higher rates&#xD;
      of associated mortality. One study using data from multiple Clinical Trials Network trials&#xD;
      showed higher rates of combined opiate and stimulant use among Black compared to White&#xD;
      adults. The rate of death is also highest among Black participants using cocaine at a rate of&#xD;
      8.3 per 100,000 population, which is nearly double the rate of death attributed to cocaine&#xD;
      among non-Hispanic Whites. This differential death rate is seen despite similar rates of&#xD;
      cocaine use among Blacks and Whites suggests the need for action to address this racial&#xD;
      disparity in health outcomes. Under-representation of ethnic minorities in clinical trials&#xD;
      has significant scientific implications and ultimately compromises generalizability of&#xD;
      research findings and further exacerbates existing racial health disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: While significant attention has been devoted to identifying barriers to inclusion,&#xD;
      the current proposal seeks to redirect efforts away from documenting barriers and instead&#xD;
      towards improved recruitment and retention of Black/African American (AA) individuals into&#xD;
      Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs). This will be achieved by developing a comprehensive and&#xD;
      innovative manual that maps out concrete strategies for both increased recruitment and&#xD;
      retention in RCTs&#xD;
