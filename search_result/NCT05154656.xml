  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver fibrosis is the main feature in early chronic liver diseases. If identified early,&#xD;
      liver fibrosis is reversible. The current gold standard for diagnosing liver fibrosis is&#xD;
      invasive liver biopsy. Existing non-invasive methods still have significant limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1rho imaging is a promising non-invasive technology evaluating liver fibrosis. It does not&#xD;
      require exogenous contrast agent or extra hardware. However, it remains challenging to&#xD;
      perform T1rho measurements of the liver. The rich blood signal in the liver introduces&#xD;
      quantification errors of liver parenchyma. The existing black blood MRI technologies are&#xD;
      based on Cartesian FSE acquisitions, which are not optimal for liver imaging. The residual&#xD;
      blood signal is often observed which confounds the measurement. Current T1rho measurement of&#xD;
      the liver is mostly performed in two-dimension. 3D coverage of liver is desirable. However,&#xD;
      3D T1rho imaging of liver suffers from long scan time due to increased spatial coverage,&#xD;
      reduced scan time efficiency from motion compensation, and high specific absorption rate&#xD;
      (SAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to overcome these challenges by developing 3D T1rho imaging technologies based on&#xD;
      magnetization prepared spiral FSE acquisition. Compared to Cartesian FSE, Spiral FSE&#xD;
      traverses k-space more efficiently per unit of time, and has reduced SAR due to significantly&#xD;
      decreased number of radiofrequency pulses in the echo trains. Spiral acquisition has zero&#xD;
      gradient moment at the kspace center, which substantially reduces its sensitivity to&#xD;
      respiratory motion. The residual motion manifests as benign incoherent artifacts in the image&#xD;
      domain rather than detrimental structured artifacts. Differently to Cartesian FSE, Spiral FSE&#xD;
      provides flexibility to design and optimize flow-sensitizing gradients throughout the echo&#xD;
      trains to achieve superior suppression of blood signal. We will evaluate the proposed pulse&#xD;
      sequences in both healthy controls and patients with liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide new black blood imaging technologies and a 3D diagnostic tool for&#xD;
      early detection of liver fibrosis. This will improve clinical outcomes for patients with&#xD;
      chronic liver disease, and provide a springboard for further development of MRI technology&#xD;
      for other purposes.&#xD;
