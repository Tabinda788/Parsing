  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot prospective study designed to capture information about the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the ToeFX Therapy Light.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to a report published by the NCBI on January 14, 2015, some 3 to 12% of the&#xD;
      population is affected by toenfail fungus, with older populations more likely to be affected.&#xD;
      Indeed, fungal infection of nails (onychomycosis) is among the most prevalent infectious&#xD;
      diseases in humans. According to a communication released by the Ontario College of&#xD;
      Physicians and Surgeons in September 2019, the cure rate for topical treatments is only 6-23%&#xD;
      after 1 year. Even after 1 year of treatment, topical treatments have limited efficacy.&#xD;
      Moreover, onychomycosis is cosmetically distressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an open-label, prospective pilot study. The subjects will be 100 patients&#xD;
      who suffer from distal subungual onychomycosis. The purpose of the study is to establish the&#xD;
      efficacy of the ToeFX Therapy Light, which has shown compelling results in in vitro and ex&#xD;
      vivo (cadaver) studies but has not been tested in patients. Specifically, we wish to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the safety and efficacy of this therapy in the treatment of distal subungual&#xD;
           onychomycosis of the toenail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the number of treatments required to clear the nail and to cure the fungus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finalize the treatment protocol, device design and user interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Test re-infection or recurrence of fungus post-treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Clear nail: We will monitor whether subjects attain 3 mm or more of clear nail growth post-treatment. We will verify by taking a photograph prior to every treatment to assess the change in millimeters (mm) of clear nail bed. Millimeters of clear nail from the base of the toenail will be determined from digital photographs of the toenail and verified via software. An increase in mm of clear nail between the two measurement points indicates that the toenail has improved and is positive for study success. A decrease in mm of clear nail between the two measurement points indicates that the toenail has worsened and is negative for study success. Length of the unaffected part of the target nail is measured in millimeters along the midpoint from the nail fold to the proximal border of the affected part (lowest point affected) along the midpoint of the target nail.</description>

    <description>Arm 1 will test the core technology of the ToeFX system; this study reproduces methods well-described in the literature. After application of the formulation, nails affected by onychomycosis are exposed to red light at a wavelength of 630-660 nm intensity of 200 mW/cm2.</description>

    <description>Some research has shown that exposure to mild blue light can have anti-inflammatory effects that would improve patient onychomycosis outcomes. We will assess whether inclusion of blue light in the protocol affects the clinical outcome.</description>

    <intervention_name>Single wavelength light (red) only</intervention_name>
    <description>Clinicians should confirm a diagnosis of distal subungual onychomycosis (DSO). Clinician should assign an OSI score to each nail using the Onychomycosis Severity Index (OSI). The ToeFX system is intended for use in any room in which standard foot care treatments are routinely administered. Debridement should not be carried out more proximally than the most proximal margin of the dystrophic nail, as this can interfere with assessment of clear nail area attributable to the device intervention. The clinician should debride the nail, apply formula, and position the affected foot directly under the ToeFX ClearToe Therapy red light (640-660 nm). For safety, the light has a built-in timer and automatically switches off after 15 minutes. The process should be repeated every 2 weeks for 6 months.</description>

             the skin immediately adjacent to the toenails during the treatment period unless&#xD;
             directed to do so by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are willing to refrain from using topical steroids or topical antifungals on toenails&#xD;
             or the skin immediately adjacent to the toenails or systemic antifungals for the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  are willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary informed consent in English&#xD;
             before any protocol-specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are able to complete the study and comply with study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  persons who are hypersensitive to topical creams, ointments, medications, or&#xD;
             surfactants.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  persons who have participated in a clinical trial for the systemic treatment of&#xD;
             onychomycosis of the toenails within 6 months prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
