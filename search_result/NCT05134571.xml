  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single treatment arm study that is open-label to be conducted in Chinese&#xD;
      participants with MPS I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Aldurazyme in Chinese MPS I&#xD;
      participants, and to evaluate the efficacy of Aldurazyme on the percent change of urinary&#xD;
      glycosaminoglycans (uGAGs) from baseline to Week 26. The study will also evaluate the effect&#xD;
      on uGAG level and liver volume (hepatomegaly) after 26 weeks, with Aldurazyme treatment in&#xD;
      Chinese MPS I participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration will include: 2 weeks of screening, 26 weeks of treatment and 1 week of&#xD;
      follow-up period. During the treatment period, weekly visits are designed to accommodate&#xD;
      weekly administration of Aldurazyme (laronidase).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study duration for each participant will be a total of 29 weeks which will include 2 weeks of&#xD;
      screening, 26 weeks of treatment period and 1 week of follow-up period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chinese participants have a documented diagnosis of MPS I confirmed by measurable&#xD;
             clinical signs and symptoms of MPS I and fibroblast or leukocyte IDUA (iduronidase)&#xD;
             activity &lt;10% of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants have to be able to stand independently and walk a minimum of 5 meters in&#xD;
             6 minutes.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Is a WOCBP and agrees to use an acceptable contraceptive method during the&#xD;
                  intervention period and at a minimum until 7 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
                  intervention.&#xD;
