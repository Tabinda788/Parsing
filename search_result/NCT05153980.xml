      Sixty athletes will be randomized in two groups; (1) an experimental group and (2) a control&#xD;
      group. Both groups will undergo the following procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moment 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline testing: countermovement jump, 25m sprint and strength assessment of the&#xD;
           Hamstrings and Quadriceps muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Short warm-up (approximately 4 minutes), which will be completed with blood flow&#xD;
           restriction cuffs (experimental group) or without (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post testing: same tests as performed in baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moment 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline testing: stiffness measurements of the Biceps Femoris Long Head via Shear Wave&#xD;
           Elastography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Short warm-up (approximately 4 minutes), which will be completed with blood flow&#xD;
           restriction cuffs (experimental group) or without (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post testing: same tests as performed in baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both moments of testing as well as the order in which the performance tests take place are&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, athletes perform a warm-up program before participating in sport activities,&#xD;
      due to its assumed beneficial effect on performance and injury prevention. However, within&#xD;
      team sports, substitutes usually do not perform the comprehensive pre-match warm-up. In many&#xD;
      cases, those substitute players get a very short period of time, during the game, to prepare&#xD;
      themselves for coming on to the pitch where they immediately have to perform at a very&#xD;
      high-intensity. Hence, this could lead to a poorer performance and a greater injury risk for&#xD;
      those substitute players, as they did not get a decent warm-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, new techniques are needed in order to prepare the substitute athletes optimally in&#xD;
      a very short period of time (often within a few minutes). Consequently, the aim of this study&#xD;
      is to investigate whether the incorporation of Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) within a warm-up&#xD;
      routine could be of additional value. Both performance parameters and muscle stiffness will&#xD;
      be evaluated. As Hamstring strain Injuries (HSI) are common within sports encompassing&#xD;
      high-speed running, this muscle group will be investigated on muscle stiffness as a&#xD;
      representation of the interventional effect on muscle stiffness. Athletes will be randomized&#xD;
      in two groups of 30 participants (anticipated); (1) an experimental group and (2) a control&#xD;
      group. Both groups will perform baseline testing (5x Countermovement Jump, 25m Sprint and&#xD;
      Muscle Strength of hamstrings and Quadriceps), and a short warm-up program, followed by&#xD;
      repeating the same tests as executed in baseline. The experimental group will receive Blood&#xD;
      Flow Restriction within the warm-up routine, whereas the control group will do the same warm&#xD;
      up program but without BFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a separate occasion, the same athletes will perform the same warm-up routine with a Shear&#xD;
      Wave Elastographic assessment of the Biceps Femoris Long Head before and after (immediately&#xD;
      after, after 5 minutes and once more after 10 minutes) the warm-up.&#xD;

    <description>The stiffness of the Biceps Femoris Long Head of the dominant leg will be assessed via a Shear Wave Elastography Device (Mach 30, SuperSonic Imagine), before and immediately after the warm-up routine. The muscle stiffness will be expressed in Kilopascals (kPa).</description>
