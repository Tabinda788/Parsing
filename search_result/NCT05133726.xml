  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avoidable hospital readmissions are a pressing problem for our healthcare system. They lead&#xD;
      to substantial human suffering and higher financial costs. Most discharged psychiatric&#xD;
      inpatients in Alberta are offered follow-up appointments with Alberta Health Services (AHS)&#xD;
      Addiction and Mental Health (AMH) community providers. Patients often wait 28-38 weeks for&#xD;
      their first appointment, which leads many to miss their first appointments, and increases the&#xD;
      likelihood of relapse. As a result, patients discharged into the community are readmitted to&#xD;
      the Emergency Department (ED). To address this significant revolving door, the investigators&#xD;
      will implement a low-cost, evidence-based system that delivers daily supportive texts to&#xD;
      patients' mobile phones. The text messages developed by experts and service users, based on&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy principles. Our proposed program also includes peer support from&#xD;
      previous mental health patients who have had similar challenges as participants, but are now&#xD;
      in recovery. In this way, the investigators aim to reduce the psychological treatment and&#xD;
      support gap for AMH patients who have been discharged from acute care and are scheduled to&#xD;
      receive mental health and psychiatric treatment from A&amp;MH services after a long wait. Our&#xD;
      pilot test of these interventions provide evidence that psychiatric readmissions, and&#xD;
      emergency department visits can be reduced by 10-25% if implemented at scale in Alberta, thus&#xD;
      resulting in cost-savings for individuals and the province.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background &amp; Rational Avoidable hospital readmission is a growing concern in health systems&#xD;
      across the world. Readmissions often lead to significant physical, psychological and&#xD;
      financial suffering on the part of patients and their families. The health system is also&#xD;
      affected by high readmission rates. Infrastructural, human and financial resources, which are&#xD;
      limited, often get stretched. This is particularly true in the era of the 2019 corona virus&#xD;
      disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has seen many hospitals overwhelmed by rising emergency&#xD;
      presentations. Consequently, there is a renewed interest to seek out solutions to mitigate&#xD;
      avoidable readmissions, particularly in acute care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with psychiatric disorders have the highest early readmission rates among all&#xD;
      hospitalized patients. Early readmission is defined as readmission within 30 days of previous&#xD;
      discharge. Whereas deinstitutionalization of care and transition to community-based mental&#xD;
      health care has been an approach of focus for decades, early hospital readmission remains&#xD;
      high. Unmet need for psychological treatment and the limited human resources to address this&#xD;
      gap is a major cause of high 30-day readmissions rates in mental acute units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Alberta, Canada, about 8.4-11.9% of residents suffer from mental illness, but less than&#xD;
      25% of these patients report that their mental health care needs were fully met. This is&#xD;
      despite almost 70% of mental health patients utilizing a provincial mental health service the&#xD;
      year before, according to a 2014 mental health gap assessment report. The greatest unmet need&#xD;
      cited is the lack of sufficient, accessible, and affordable counselling. Their next greatest&#xD;
      concern was an unmet need for tailored information on their own mental health challenges.&#xD;
      This is despite the 426 distinct interventions within AHS to address addiction and mental&#xD;
      health challenges through community health clinics, and free-standing AMH facilities, among&#xD;
      others. Interestingly, 86% of Alberta Health Services direct providers believe that they&#xD;
      provide sufficient information to clients. This contradiction between patients and community&#xD;
      providers' perspectives reinforces concerns that services may not be well tailored to the&#xD;
      diverse perceived needs of various patient groups. A consequence of this gap is the high&#xD;
      demand for more specialist services, and high readmissions after discharge from a recent&#xD;
      hospital stay with attendant implications on the cost of health services. One study reports&#xD;
      90-day readmission rates of up to 14.0%, with the median time to readmission being 24 days.&#xD;
      More findings from the 2014 mental health gap assessment revealed that current management&#xD;
      strategies are reactive, with system resources heavily invested in inpatient, residential and&#xD;
      crisis services. Technology was noted to be under-utilized in the province. Reducing the felt&#xD;
      need for hospital visits by providing alternative effective care will mitigate the existing&#xD;
      strain on healthcare human and financial resources due to mental health challenges. To&#xD;
      address this challenge, the investigators propose an innovative program which augments peer&#xD;
      support from previous mental health patients now in recovery with an evidence-based&#xD;
      supportive text messaging developed using the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components of the innovation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peer support is valued in recovery-oriented models of mental health and increasingly&#xD;
           implemented. Evidence indicates positive effects, including lower inpatient service use,&#xD;
           better relationships with providers and increased engagement. Peer Support Workers&#xD;
           (PSWs) who are in recovery and have lived experience as former patients will play&#xD;
           central roles in this study, including delivering some of the interventions proposed.&#xD;
           PSW activities will include supportive face-to-face visits, interactive phone&#xD;
           calls/texts/zoom meetings with patients, advocacy, connecting patients with community&#xD;
           resources, and experiential sharing. PSWs will be actively engaged through all&#xD;
           provincial practice councils, they are embedded within many Alberta addiction and mental&#xD;
           health (AMH) programs, making this solution workable. Evidence also shows that peers&#xD;
           support may also benefit peer PSWs, enhancing feelings of competence and personal value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Text4Support to be provided through ResilienceNHope online application&#xD;
           (https://application.resiliencenhope.com/), is a low cost, evidence-based, supportive&#xD;
           text messaging program which will be coupled with or without peer support services to&#xD;
           reduce the psychological treatment and support gap for A&amp;MH patients who have been&#xD;
           discharged from acute care into community. Starting a day after enrolment,&#xD;
           intervention-group patients will receive daily unidirectional (no-reply) supportive text&#xD;
           messages. The messages will be written by cognitive behavior therapists in partnership&#xD;
           with patients and preprogramed into ResilienceNHope which will deliver the messages to&#xD;
           the patients. The Text4Support program was developed based on knowledge from randomized&#xD;
           controlled trials conducted in Ireland and Alberta. The program is also based on&#xD;
           knowledge from the highly successful award winning Text4Mood program in Alberta's North&#xD;
           Zone which improved the psychological treatment gap and was effective, scalable (i.e., &gt;&#xD;
           10,000 recipients within 6 months) and the Text4Hope program launched in Alberta during&#xD;
           the COVID 19 pandemic which was also effective and scalable (&gt; 48,000 subscribers within&#xD;
           3 months). Text4Support provides Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based and&#xD;
           diagnosis-specific (i.e., mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and other&#xD;
           psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, adjustment disorders or personality&#xD;
           disorders), daily supportive text messages for 6 months. Some examples of the text&#xD;
           messages are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  What lies behind you and what lies before you are tiny matters compared to what&#xD;
                lies within you. Have faith in yourself, and success can be yours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are 2 days in the week we should not worry about, yesterday and tomorrow.&#xD;
                That leaves today. Live for today.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stumbling blocks can become stepping stones to a better life. You can turn&#xD;
                adversities into opportunities. Don't be discouraged by today's problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Letting go of resentment is a gift you give yourself. It will ease your journey&#xD;
                immeasurably. Make peace with everyone, and happiness will be yours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to content, analysis of Alberta service data suggests that diagnostic clusters&#xD;
      for patients discharged from acute into community for follow-up falls into six major&#xD;
      categories: mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders,&#xD;
      substance use disorders, adjustment disorders and personality disorders. Thus, text message&#xD;
      content will focus on two dimensions. First, general content that is indicated regardless of&#xD;
      symptomatology will be presented, including messages of self-care, social support, hope,&#xD;
      affirmation, and recovery. Second, specific content will be provided that focuses on&#xD;
      management of symptoms related to the specific conditions described above (e.g., activity&#xD;
      scheduling in depression). As a component of scalability and inclusiveness, text message&#xD;
      content can also be customized based on end user characteristics. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will explore content that is sensitive to needs based on age group, cultural&#xD;
      identity, gender identification, and non-English language communication. This serves to&#xD;
      enhance access for diverse groups, many of whom may be marginalized or underserved. In&#xD;
      addition, patients identified to be most at-risk of readmission to hospital will be offered&#xD;
      peer support, which also takes into account age and gender of both the patient and PSWs.&#xD;
      Options for matching patients and PSWs by cultural identity and sexual orientation will be&#xD;
      explored as the project is scaled up and the pool of PSWs increases. Consequently,&#xD;
      recruitment of PSWs will take into account diversity in age, gender, cultural identity and&#xD;
      sexual orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim This study is designed to address gaps in care/support available at the community&#xD;
      level for psychiatric patients discharged from hospital and referred to community mental&#xD;
      health services for follow-up. The investigators aim to reduce the psychological treatment&#xD;
      and support gap for AMH patients who have been discharged from acute care and are scheduled&#xD;
      to receive mental health and psychiatric treatment from AMH services after a long wait. Our&#xD;
      pilot test (unpublished) of these interventions provide evidence that psychiatric&#xD;
      readmissions, and emergency department visits can be reduced by 10-25% if implemented at&#xD;
      scale in Alberta, thus resulting in cost-savings for individuals and the province.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis This study will both evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention as&#xD;
      well as implementation context and outcomes. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation&#xD;
      Research (CFIR) will provide an overarching guidance to design, implementation, and&#xD;
      evaluation by examining outer/inner contexts, intervention characteristics, and stakeholders&#xD;
      involved as well as the process of implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, using the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation- Maintenance (RE-AIM)&#xD;
      framework, the investigators will: examine the reach of the interventions, i.e., text and&#xD;
      peer support; evaluate their effectiveness; gauge support for their adoption; evaluate&#xD;
      fidelity in implementation; and document the maintenance (sustainability) of implementation&#xD;
      post-trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster-randomized approach will be applied, providing&#xD;
      Text4Support and Peer Support Service (PSS) to 10,800 patients recruited across 11 acute care&#xD;
      sites and day hospitals across Alberta as the clustered unit of randomization. The design&#xD;
      reconciles constraints under which policy makers and service managers operate with need for&#xD;
      rigorous scientific evaluations. In a stepped-wedge study, the design is extended so every&#xD;
      cluster provides pre-post observations, and switches from control to intervention exposure&#xD;
      but not at the same time-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design has been successfully used to implement complex programs and change management&#xD;
      involving large-scale programs in many countries. The study also adheres to the various&#xD;
      checklists from the EQUATOR network.&#xD;
