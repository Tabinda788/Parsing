    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the visualization of the glottis, the time for tracheal&#xD;
      intubation, the success rate of intubation, and the need for manoeuvres to optimize the view&#xD;
      using video stylet or video laryngoscope in patients with expected difficult intubations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The airway, breathing and circulation support '' ABCs&quot; of trauma resuscitation were born from&#xD;
      the assumption that correcting hypoxemia and hypotension reduces morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Definitive care for severely injured or polytrauma patients includes the ability to provide&#xD;
      advanced airway management in a variety of settings: in the emergency department, 20% to 30%&#xD;
      intubations are for trauma. Airway management in traumatic patient presents numerous unique&#xD;
      challenges beyond placement of an endotracheal tube, without comes dependent on the&#xD;
      provider's ability to predict and anticipate difficulty and have a safe and executable plan.&#xD;
      In severely injured patients, the cervical spine must be protected by in-line immobilisation&#xD;
      during airway management. If orotracheal intubation is required, then manual in-line&#xD;
      stabilisation is recommended to facilitate tracheal intubation to secure a space for tongue&#xD;
      displacement into the submandibular space. However, manual in-line stabilisation can make&#xD;
      alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes difficult, resulting in a poor direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopic view and prolonging the intubation time. Video stylets, which are portable and&#xD;
      easier to prepare than flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopes, could be better option for tracheal&#xD;
      intubation in patient with cervical immobilization. Previous studies have shown the&#xD;
      usefulness of video stylets for tracheal intubation in cervical immobilized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video laryngoscopes provide a better laryngeal view. They are easy to use and have a high&#xD;
      success rate and short intubation time in patients with predicted difficult airways.&#xD;
      Successful use of video laryngoscopy is increasing for airway management of patients with&#xD;
      trauma in the emergency department.&#xD;
