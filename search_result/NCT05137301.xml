  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High accuracy and precision bone age assessment is very important for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment monitoring of various pediatric diseases. The commonly used bone age assessment&#xD;
      methods include GP atlas, TW3 score and Zhonghua 05. GP method is to compare wrist X-ray&#xD;
      films with atlas reference X-ray films. Its main disadvantages are strong subjectivity and&#xD;
      long atlas standard interval. Different from GP method, TW3 method is to grade and score each&#xD;
      bone, add each epiphyseal score to calculate the total score of bone maturity, and obtain the&#xD;
      corresponding final bone age value. Although TW3 scoring method is relatively accurate, it is&#xD;
      complex and time-consuming, and there is great variability among evaluators. In order to&#xD;
      evaluate bone age more efficiently and accurately, a method based on computer image automatic&#xD;
      recognition technology can help to overcome these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 1000 children aged 1-18 in 5 hospitals are selected as the research objects.&#xD;
      After taking bone age films with bone age instrument, the film reading results and evaluation&#xD;
      time of AI Group, artificial group and standard group are recorded. One month later, the&#xD;
      artificial group re-analyzes 1000 films with the assistance of AI system, and the evaluation&#xD;
      time is recorded. Finally, the accuracy and time difference of artificial group, AI Group,&#xD;
      artificial combined AI Group and standard group are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use the most advanced artificial intelligence deep learning&#xD;
      bone age evaluation software to explore the value of bone age instrument to improve the&#xD;
      accuracy and diagnostic efficiency of bone age evaluation by pediatricians.&#xD;

      1. Study subjects: Radiographs of the left wrist of 1000 children aged 1-18 years who&#xD;
           underwent bone age measurement at 5 hospitals were selected&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 general information: name, gender, actual age, height, weight, BMI, race, disease type&#xD;
      2.2 main instrument: artificial intelligence X-ray bone age instrument 2.3 scanning scheme:&#xD;
      Left posterior and anterior radiographs 2.4 bone age evaluation method and group 2.4.1 the&#xD;
      standard group：Tw3-RUS and TW3-CARPAL were used to evaluate the left hand bone age tablets by&#xD;
      the 5 pediatric doctors designated in the TW3 system training. There was no time limit for&#xD;
      reading the tablets. The mean value of the evaluation results of the 5 doctors was taken as&#xD;
      the final reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4.2 Grouping of bone age assessment ① artificial group (5 assessors assess bone age&#xD;
      separately) ② AI Group③ artificial + AI Group (artificial Group assesses bone age with the&#xD;
      assistance of AI intelligent software assessment) After taking bone age films with bone age&#xD;
      instrument, the film reading results and evaluation time of AI Group, artificial group and&#xD;
      standard group are recorded. One month later, the artificial group re-analyzes 1000 films&#xD;
      with the assistance of AI system, and the evaluation time is recorded. Finally, the accuracy&#xD;
      and time difference of artificial group, AI Group, artificial combined AI Group and standard&#xD;
      group are compared.&#xD;
