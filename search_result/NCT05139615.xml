      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and effect on cardiac&#xD;
      function of intravenous APD418 in adult participants with heart failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFrEF).&#xD;

      This study has an adaptive design, in which dose escalation in Part A will inform dose&#xD;
      expansion in Part B. Part A is a single-ascending dose, placebo-controlled study planned to&#xD;
      consist of 5 cohorts evaluating 5 doses of APD418. Part B is a parallel-treatment group study&#xD;
      planned to evaluate 2 doses of APD418 and placebo. Participants in Part A cannot participate&#xD;
      in Part B.&#xD;
