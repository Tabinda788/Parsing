  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty is the preferred treatment for hip disease (primary or secondary&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis, for example) and femoral neck fractures (FOUTEAU 2014).&#xD;
      Revision risk factors reported when considering the main surgical approaches. Moerman et al.&#xD;
      studied the Dutch arthroplasty registry. They found a revision rate in hemiarthroplasty (HA)&#xD;
      of 1.6% at 1 year and 2.5% at 5 years postoperatively. For total hip replacement (THA), the&#xD;
      rate was 2.4% at 1 and 4.3% at 5 years postoperatively (Moerman et al., 2018). They also&#xD;
      analyzed that the risk factors for hemiarthroplasty were male sex, age under 80 (regardless&#xD;
      of gender), posterolateral approach and uncemented fixation. The risk factors for HAT were&#xD;
      exactly the same, but they found that smoking also played a role. It should be noted that age&#xD;
      as a risk factor for revision is not a risk during the first year after the fracture, but&#xD;
      becomes one in the years that follow (Moerman et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maintain compliance with the directive on medical devices (93/42 / EEC [M5]) and&#xD;
      the future regulation (EU) (2017/745) relating to medical devices, SERF has set up&#xD;
      post-market clinical follow-ups ( PMCF). This PMCF study aims to improve knowledge related to&#xD;
      the performance, safety and benefit / risk ratio of the Sagitta EVL-R stem and to monitor&#xD;
      patient care strategy through this clinical evaluation. Significant clinical results as well&#xD;
      as safety must be confirmed with this patient cohort. It is important to note that this&#xD;
      cohort reflects the specific care strategy of the University Hospital of Poitiers (Teyssédou&#xD;
      et al, 2013). Therefore, the strategy could be different between hospitals and countries.&#xD;

    <description>Hip revision surgery is performed to repair an artificial hip joint (prosthesis) that has been damaged over time due to an infection, or due to normal wear and tear of the prosthetic hip. Revision surgery helps to correct the problem so the hip can function normally again.</description>
