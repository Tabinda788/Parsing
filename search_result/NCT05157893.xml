  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, open, single-center clinical study. This study is a pilot&#xD;
      study to explore the use of VR based distraction and relaxation therapy as an adjunctive&#xD;
      analgesic method for Chinese patients with moderate to severe pain. After screening, patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe pain who meet the study inclusion criteria receive VR therapy for 15&#xD;
      minutes to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VR therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in pain intensity before and after VR therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>20min</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity is measured using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) of pain. The anchors for the numerical rating scale were &quot;Ten is the worst pain anyone could ever have and zero is no pain at all.&quot; Before the VR therapy started, the participant would be asked what his or her pain level is on the 0-10 numerical rating scale. After the 15 minute VR therapy, the participant would be asked what his or her pain level at that moment, again using the 0-10 numerical rating scale. The change in pain intensity before and after VR therapy is then obtained with the two pain level numbers subtracted.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a single 15 min VR therapy. The VR therapy is consisted of VR device and software. The model of VR device used is Pico Neo 3 Pro. The software run on the VR device delivers two types of contents: 1) A 7min of computer-generated 360 video of underwater scene with therapeutic music to distract patients' attention on pain and make patients passively relax. 2) An 8min guided relaxation in which patients are transported to seaside with narrative to achieve image and breathing relaxation.</description>
