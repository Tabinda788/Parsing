  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will expand the types of pediatric cancers being evaluated for response to&#xD;
      cabozantinib. The current COG study is restricted to Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma,&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, and a handful of uncommon tumors. The proposed study will&#xD;
      extend this evaluation to tumors that have been shown to either express known targets of&#xD;
      cabozantinib or with preclinical evidence of efficacy. These include neuroblastoma,&#xD;
      high-grade gliomas, diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and other high-grade brain tumors, and&#xD;
      germ cell tumors. These tumors have high morbidity and mortality, particularly in the relapse&#xD;
      setting, and few or no proven therapeutic options. As such, evaluation of cabozantinib in&#xD;
      these studies is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that use of cabozantinib in patients with ultra-high-risk pediatric&#xD;
      solid tumors with minimal disease burden, as defined in the inclusion criteria below, can&#xD;
      prevent and/or slow recurrent tumor formation in pediatric solid tumors and thereby&#xD;
      significantly extend the period of disease control and/or induce a durable cure.&#xD;

      The study hypothesizes that use of cabozantinib in patients with ultra-high-risk pediatric&#xD;
      solid tumors with minimal disease burden, as defined in the inclusion criteria below, can&#xD;
      prevent and/or slow recurrent tumor formation in pediatric solid tumors and thereby&#xD;
      significantly extend the period of disease control and/or induce a durable cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of up to one year of treatment with&#xD;
      cabozantinib in pediatric solid tumors with a minimal disease burden. There are multiple&#xD;
      reasons for this approach, as opposed to continual therapy until toxicity or disease&#xD;
      progression alone. First, for most of these ultra-high-risk diseases, the greatest risk of&#xD;
      recurrence has historically been within 12 months after last therapy, and often times&#xD;
      considerably sooner (18, 44-49). As such, the investigators should be able to evaluate a&#xD;
      meaningful difference within 12 months. Second, the goal of this study is to evaluate if,&#xD;
      during a critical period of disease control, use of cabozantinib can induce a durable&#xD;
      remission. There are active Phase 2 and 3 studies of cabozantinib, including with the&#xD;
      Children's Oncology Group, evaluating the efficacy of cabozantinib in controlling pediatric&#xD;
      cancers with measurable burden of disease. However, we know that in patients with minimal,&#xD;
      immeasurable disease burden there is still active disease with high risk of growth. This&#xD;
      study seeks to augment ongoing work in pediatric cancers by testing the hypothesis that&#xD;
      cabozantinib can durably silence cancer cell viability in a minimal residual disease state.&#xD;
      Third, this work would mark a fundamental change in the indication for use of cabozantinib in&#xD;
      pediatric cancers, broadening its utility from a &quot;rescue&quot; agent to a maintenance therapy that&#xD;
      may be critical for disease control, during either primary or secondary remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will expand the types of pediatric cancers being evaluated for response to&#xD;
      cabozantinib. The current COG study is restricted to Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma,&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, and a handful of uncommon tumors. The proposed study will&#xD;
      extend this evaluation to tumors that have been shown to either express known targets of&#xD;
      cabozantinib or with preclinical evidence of efficacy. These include neuroblastoma,&#xD;
      high-grade gliomas, diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and other high-grade brain tumors, and&#xD;
      germ cell tumors. These tumors have high morbidity and mortality, particularly in the relapse&#xD;
      setting, and few or no proven therapeutic options. As such, evaluation of cabozantinib in&#xD;
      these studies is warranted.&#xD;
