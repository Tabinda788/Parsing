  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial of 316 patients with opioid use disorder&#xD;
      (OUD) and chronic pain (CP) to test the effectiveness of treatment as usual compared with&#xD;
      Stepped Care for Patients to Optimize Whole Recovery (SC-POWR) to reduce illicit opioid use&#xD;
      and pain interference (Aim 1) and decrease alcohol use, anxiety, depression, and stress, and&#xD;
      improve sleep (Aim 2). Eligible participants will begin medications for opioid use disorder&#xD;
      (MOUD) and will be randomized to receive SC-POWR (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),&#xD;
      MOUD, and onsite groups for exercise [Wii Fit, Tai Chi] and stress reduction [relaxation&#xD;
      training, auricular acupuncture] for 24 weeks. Participants will be followed for another 24&#xD;
      weeks to evaluate durability of treatment response illicit opioid use, alcohol use, pain&#xD;
      interference, anxiety, depression, stress, sleep, and retention in MOUD (Aim 3).&#xD;

      Participants who meet criteria for CP and OUD (N=316) will be initiated onto MOUD and&#xD;
      randomized to 24 weeks of either treatment as usual (TAU) or 24 weeks of SC-POWR. SC-POWR&#xD;
      patients will be &quot;stepped up&quot; according to a priori criteria. Patients randomized to SC-POWR&#xD;
      will receive a behavioral intervention consisting of 12 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      sessions over a 24 week period. ). In step 1, patients receive CBT. The clinical threshold&#xD;
      for stepping up care is presence in the past 14 days of positive/missed opioid urine test or&#xD;
      no mprovement in pain interference since baseline (i.e., &lt;1 point change on 3-item Pain,&#xD;
      Enjoyment of Life, and General Activity (PEG) scale)). At week 6, patients meeting the&#xD;
      clinical threshold are advanced to Step 2 (CBT and 10 weekly exercise sessions). At week 15,&#xD;
      patients meeting the clinical threshold are advanced to step 3 (CBT and 10 weekly group&#xD;
      sessions of exercise and stress reduction). Patients choose which exercise and stress&#xD;
      reduction groups to attend. Following 24 weeks of SC-POWR, patients are offered once monthly&#xD;
      peer-support groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in composite illicit opioid use and pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weekly for 24 weeks, weeks 36 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid use is measured by the Timeline Followback (TLFB) and confirmed by urine drug testing. The TLFB uses a calendar to measure opioid or other drug use over a desired time period; it is a self-reported measure of drug use. To confirm the self report, a urine test will be performed to detect the presence of opioids. Pain interference is measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), an 11-item scale which is a self report of pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). 0 is no pain at all; 1-4 is mild pain; 5-6 is moderate pain, and 7-10 is worst pain. Pain interference will be calculated using items from the Brief Pain Inventory. The composite outcome will take into account reductions in both illicit opioid use and pain interference.</description>

    <measure>Change in alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weekly for 24 weeks, weeks 36 and 48</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Baseline, monthly for 24 weeks, weeks 36 and 48</time_frame>
