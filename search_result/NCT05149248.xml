      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined strategy of human papillomavirus virus&#xD;
      (HPV) vaccination and high-risk HPV screening to reduce the occurrence of neoplasms in the&#xD;
      anogenital region and oral cavity among men who have sex with men, people with HIV, homeless&#xD;
      people, transgender women, female sex workers and rape victims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This mixed methods study evaluates the effectiveness of a combined&#xD;
      vaccination-screening strategy to reduce HPV prevalence/incidence and occurrence of cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+ and/or anal intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+, using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier. The time-to-event method will evaluate time from positive results for specific&#xD;
      anogenital HPV to incidence of anogenital lesions containing that HPV type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: This study will generate scientific evidence on effectiveness of a combined&#xD;
      vaccination-screening strategy to reduce the burden of HPV-associated neoplasms within&#xD;
      vulnerable populations in Mexico.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM), people with HIV, homeless people (many of whom participate&#xD;
      in survival sex), female sex workers, transgender women and rape victims are at high risk for&#xD;
      human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and consequently developing cancers associated with&#xD;
      chronic HPV infection including cervical, vaginal , vulvar , and anal cancers in women,&#xD;
      cancer of the penis , anal cancer, in men, and cancer of the oropharynx , tongue, and tonsils&#xD;
      in both men and women, In part, this is related to increased life expectancy among people&#xD;
      with HIV (given greater anti-retroviral treatment coverage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some countries have implemented HPV vaccination policies that include men. This is based on&#xD;
      promotion of protection against an increased risk of HPV infection, universal increase in&#xD;
      coverage and a gender equity perspective . Since population-level introduction of HPV&#xD;
      vaccines, there has been a dramatic impact in areas with over 60% vaccination coverage.&#xD;
      Decreases of approximately 90% have been reported for HPV-6/11/16/18 infections, over 90% for&#xD;
      new cases of genital warts, 45% for low-grade cytological abnormalities, and 85% for&#xD;
      anogenital high-grade histological lesions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HPV FASTER concept combines HPV vaccination with HPV screening. It is based on the HPV&#xD;
      vaccine's high efficacy and the high sensitivity of high-risk HPV testing for primary&#xD;
      detection of anogenital cancer precursor lesions (as documented by our research group in more&#xD;
      than 200,000 Mexican women). This strategy is effective because HPV vaccination among women&#xD;
      and men over a wide age range offers protection to those not currently infected and protects&#xD;
      against subsequent re-infections16. Thus, a combined HPV vaccination and screening strategy&#xD;
      will potentially: 1) mitigate the demand for timely screening tests by expanding screening&#xD;
      intervals; 2) improve the cost-benefit balance of secondary prevention programs; and 3)&#xD;
      provide greater protection and quality of life to more people by reducing the burden of&#xD;
      diseases attributable to HPV. This intervention can save many lives over the next 30 years&#xD;
      and be more cost-effective than traditional approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the US vaccination advisory group recommended HPV vaccination among sexually abused&#xD;
      children, recognizing their increased risk of HPV infection , . The US Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control recommends administering the HPV vaccine to subjects with immunosuppressive&#xD;
      conditions, HIV infection, and men who have sex with men . HPV vaccination in HIV-positive&#xD;
      people is safe and reduces the incidence of HPV-associated cancers, including anal cancer,&#xD;
      which is increasing in these populations , . Moreover, some research has shown that&#xD;
      vaccination against HPV in populations with HIV is cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV serotypes 16 and 18, found in the HPV bivalent and tetravalent vaccines, have an&#xD;
      estimated relative contribution to invasive cervical cancer of at least 70% in Latin America.&#xD;
      These vaccines are highly effective, provide high levels of immunogenicity , have acceptable&#xD;
      security profiles and have been incorporated into public vaccination policies with 3-dose&#xD;
      schedules over a 6-month period based on pharmaceutical industry recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative schedules of population vaccinations have been implemented in spite of the&#xD;
      conflict of interest with the pharmaceutical industry. The first of these schedules was&#xD;
      conducted in Quebec, Canada where the extended 0-6-60 month schedule was promoted for girls&#xD;
      under 16 years . Later, in Mexico, a similar vaccination program recommended by a group of&#xD;
      experts coordinated by the National Institute of Public Health was initiated. Mexico was a&#xD;
      pioneer in adopting a 2-dose alternative vaccination schedule in April 2014. Currently, there&#xD;
      is evidence that alternative schedules are not inferior to the traditional schedule in terms&#xD;
      of immunogenicity . In 2012 , Switzerland adopted a 2-dose vaccination schedule against HPV&#xD;
      in girls under 15 years old under assuming age was the main mediator of the protection&#xD;
      induced by the vaccine and not the number of doses. This assumption would explain why the&#xD;
      vaccine was the main inducer of IgG responses, plasma cells, and memory B cell formation and&#xD;
      why 2 doses administered with a 6-month interval provided similar protection during the&#xD;
      initial years of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In April 2014, the Council officially pronounced the adoption of a vaccination schedule&#xD;
      against HPV with only 2 doses with a periodicity of 0 and 6 months. The justification for&#xD;
      this resolution, in which Mexico was a pioneer and was subsequently officially recommended by&#xD;
      the WHO as a vaccination policy at a global level, was that the immunological responses of&#xD;
      girls aged 9 to 11 years after two doses of HPV vaccine were similar to or greater than those&#xD;
      obtained after three doses in women aged 16 to 26 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of this decision are logistical and economic; increasing coverage and providing&#xD;
      greater flexibility in the application of the second dose. Moreover, the savings generated&#xD;
      from not administering a third dose are considerable. Alternative schedules with two doses&#xD;
      and schedules with a third dose at 60 months in girls 9-11 years of age can offer a)&#xD;
      improvements in the immune response in the medium- and long-term, because there is evidence&#xD;
      that a new exposure to HPV increases the expression of antibodies logarithmically, and b)&#xD;
      advantages in its administration, since it is easier to organize these schedules within the&#xD;
      framework of schools and consequently provides a better opportunity for equity in obtaining&#xD;
      greater coverage and adherence to complete schedules in the captive population before leaving&#xD;
      compulsory schooling. However, although the recommendation is plausible from an immunological&#xD;
      perspective, there is no evidence from clinical trials of efficacy to support this&#xD;
      determination for ethical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, a paradigm shift is perceived toward the application of a single dose of vaccine&#xD;
      against HPV. Research groups at a global level are evaluating the hypothesis that men and&#xD;
      women who receive one versus two doses do not have a higher prevalence of HPV and that&#xD;
      consequently the effect of the intervention is equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, demonstration studies are being conducted in population universes to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of a single dose of HPV vaccine. The strategy is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      administering 1 versus 2 doses in a specific community using a randomized intervention&#xD;
      allocation strategy. In the 2-dose intervention group, the most biologically and logistically&#xD;
      efficient approach is to administer the second intervention between 6 and 12 months after the&#xD;
      first intervention. The outcome to be evaluated in men who have sex with men is the presence&#xD;
      of HPV DNA in the anal canal, which is obtained and determined in the basal measurement&#xD;
      during the administration of the first dose. This type of intervention is feasible in Mexico&#xD;
      due to its invaluable tradition of innovation in public policies for the prevention and&#xD;
      control of anogenital cancer and its implementation of large demonstration studies.&#xD;
      Currently, it can be affirmed that with the current evidence, vaccination of all groups at&#xD;
      risk of anogenital cancer with a single dose will be the preamble to the attenuation of the&#xD;
      impact of persistent HPV infections and their consequent lesions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The application of a combined HPV vaccination scheme and screening through the&#xD;
           identification of high-risk HPV subtypes will reduce the prevalence of HPV infection in&#xD;
           the oral and anogenital cavities in the different study groups, at 12 months&#xD;
           post-vaccination. Consequently, the occurrence of grade 2 or higher anal intraepithelial&#xD;
           neoplasia (AIN 2+) lesions in men and high-grade or higher cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
           neoplasia (CIN 2+) lesions in women will decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative vaccination schedules of one versus two doses of prophylactic vaccines&#xD;
           against HPV are equivalent in terms of effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and self-collected vaginal, anal canal, and oral cavity samples constitute an&#xD;
           alternative epidemiological surveillance approach for monitoring the impact of a&#xD;
           combined strategy HPV vaccination and screening for high-risk HPV subtypes in vulnerable&#xD;
           populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined strategy of HPV vaccination and screening for&#xD;
      high-risk HPV subtypes to reduce the occurrence of HPV in the anogenital region and oral&#xD;
      cavity in five highly vulnerable groups in Mexico City, Mexico: men who have sex with men,&#xD;
      female sex workers, transgender women, subjects living in street situations, and people who&#xD;
      have suffered rape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of alternative HPV vaccination schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the usefulness of the collection of self-collected vaginal, anal, and urine&#xD;
           samples as alternatives for monitoring the impact of a combined strategy of HPV&#xD;
           vaccination and screening based on the detection of high-risk HPV subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the barriers to and facilitators of the introduction of a combined HPV&#xD;
           vaccination and primary screening strategy with tests for high-risk HPV subtypes in the&#xD;
           study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and procedures The sample sizes for the five cohorts are: 6,000 MSM, 500&#xD;
      transgender women, 400 homeless men and women, 400 sexual assault victims, 2500 female sex&#xD;
      workers. This study is a mixed methods study combining public health interventions offering&#xD;
      primary and secondary prevention of HPV to populations highly vulnerable to these health&#xD;
      problems with evaluation of the interventions in a 12-month follow-up. In addition the study&#xD;
      includes qualitative interviews that will undergo systematic analysis on the perceptions,&#xD;
      meanings, and individual experiences of the intervention, within the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A central element of the present project is a parallel study of five sentinel cohorts of the&#xD;
      adult population ≥ 14 years and ≤ 45 years of age that is operationally coordinated by the&#xD;
      Condesa and Iztapalapa Specialized Clinics, which belong to the health services of Mexico&#xD;
      City and the Program of Care for rape victims. This program is coordinated by the Specialized&#xD;
      Clinics in collaboration with the Mexico City Attorney General of Justice.especially the&#xD;
      Victims Care Center, which is a program of the Center for Therapy in Support of Victims of&#xD;
      Sex Crimes. The investigators attempt to include at least 80% of the population of each&#xD;
      interest group in the epidemiological component of the project. Study subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited (2018-2019) during their routine care within any program or service the participant&#xD;
      attend within the Condesa and Iztapalapa Specialized Clinics; in addition, posters will be&#xD;
      placed within the clinics inviting potential study subjects to participate and civil society&#xD;
      organizations which collaborate with the clinics will be visited regularly to invite persons&#xD;
      involved in their activities to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the qualitative intervention component, individuals from the five vulnerable groups will&#xD;
      be selected for voluntary participation in qualitative semi-structured interviews. This&#xD;
      sub-sample will be purposely selected to include the maximum variation of characteristics,&#xD;
      and 12 to 16 semi-structured individual interviews will be conducted for each study group.&#xD;
      These interviews will explore perceptions of HPV, experiences as users of preventive care for&#xD;
      HPV and related cancers, acceptability of and meanings related to HPV vaccination and&#xD;
      barriers to and facilitators of primary prevention (vaccination) and secondary prevention&#xD;
      (screening and treatment) of HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol and instruments were approved by the Research, Ethics and Biosecurity&#xD;
      Committees of the National Institute of Public Health. All study participants will provide&#xD;
      signed informed consent before participating in any study procedure or completing any study&#xD;
      instruments (and consent forms will be signed by two witnesses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and vaccination At the beginning of the study, all MSM who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will receive the HPV vaccination in an alternative schedule for MSM&#xD;
      of 1 versus 2 doses over a 6-month period. In addition, a control group will be screened for&#xD;
      high-risk HPV and vaccinated at 12 months. For transgender women, women and men living on the&#xD;
      street, and women and men who have suffered rape, a 2-dose regimen of the tetravalent HPV&#xD;
      vaccine will be administered over a 6-month period. The additional combined strategy&#xD;
      corresponds to screening for high-risk HPV subtypes to identify intraepithelial lesions in&#xD;
      the transformation zone of the anal and/or cervical canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, samples will be self-collected from the anal canal, oral cavity, and vaginal&#xD;
      canal. These samples will be collected both at the baseline measurement and at 12 months&#xD;
      after vaccination to assess changes in the prevalence and incidence of new HPV infections in&#xD;
      the different study groups. All HPV-positive anal and cervical samples will be evaluated&#xD;
      using liquid-based cytology; analysis will be done at the National Institute of Public&#xD;
      Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a single occasion, additional samples will be collected from a proportional sample of the&#xD;
      different study groups (70% of MSM and 90% of women, not including transgender women) for the&#xD;
      identification of other STIs, including Neisseria gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, herpes simplex&#xD;
      virus type 2, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Positive cases will be referred to&#xD;
      the corresponding medical care within their respective affiliated clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HPV detection test has been installed at the National Institute of Public Health with the&#xD;
      Cobas 4800 HPV platform. This test is a qualitative test that detects 14 high-risk genotypes&#xD;
      using specific probes. It detects genotypes 16 and 18 individually and a pool of other types&#xD;
      (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) cataloged as high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytological evaluation will be conducted for all HPV-positive samples from both the anal&#xD;
      canal and cervix. A urine sample will be obtained, centrifuged, and prepared for DNA&#xD;
      extraction. The sample will be stored at -20°C prior to processing for HPV detection. The&#xD;
      techniques for these purposes are under evaluation. Blood samples (10-ml) will be collected&#xD;
      from the study participants by vacuum venipuncture. The collected samples will be centrifuged&#xD;
      to separate the sera into 2-ml aliquots, which will be stored in cryo-vials at -20°C prior to&#xD;
      processing. Antibody responses to viral and bacterial etiological agents will be conducted as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The analytical&#xD;
           procedure will be conducted according to the corresponding manufacturer's laboratory&#xD;
           instructions , .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Syphilis. The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) screening test and the Serodia&#xD;
           Treponema pallidum (TP) confirmatory test by particle agglutination. The analytical&#xD;
           procedures will be performed in accordance with the laboratory instructions of the&#xD;
           corresponding manufacturers .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Herpes simplex virus type 2. Microplate immuno-enzymatic assay for the detection of&#xD;
           type-specific viral antibodies. Confirmation of positive samples by Western blotting&#xD;
           assay. The analytical procedures will be performed in accordance with the laboratory&#xD;
           instructions of the corresponding manufacturers In cervical samples, an automated&#xD;
           chemo-luminescent assay for bacterial DNA detection will be performed using polymerase&#xD;
           chain reaction (PCR). The analytical procedure will be conducted according to the&#xD;
           corresponding manufacturer's laboratory instructions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis To estimate the effectiveness of the strategy of combining HPV vaccination with&#xD;
      HPV screening, the differences in the prevalence of HPV and the cumulative incidence of HPV&#xD;
      infection and/or development of CIN 2+ and/or AIN 2+ will be estimated during the first 12&#xD;
      months of follow-up using the Kaplan-Meier method. The time-to-event method will be applied&#xD;
      to evaluate the time from the specific type of HPV genital positivity to the incidence of&#xD;
      anogenital lesions harboring the same HPV subtype within the lesion. The analytical unit for&#xD;
      this study is HPV 16/18 type-specific infection and generic high-risk strain infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transcripts of individual interviews will be analyzed with through coding transcribed&#xD;
      material, which implies the classification of pieces of the interviews into a priori and&#xD;
      emerging categories to systematize the information and search for patterns, similarities, and&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
