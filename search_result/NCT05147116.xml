  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continuing to rise, this pandemic&#xD;
      is expected to reach 700 million people by 2045. T2DM is a metabolic condition characterized&#xD;
      by progressive insulin resistance and chronic hyperglycemia (high blood glucose&#xD;
      concentrations). Hyperglycaemia increases the risk of both micro- and macrovascular damage,&#xD;
      whilst interventions that reduce blood glucose mitigate this risk. Weight loss, achieved&#xD;
      through exercise and dietary modification, is effective at reducing hyperglycaemia. However,&#xD;
      despite the clear benefits of exercise and weight loss, diverse psychological, sociological&#xD;
      and logistical factors can make it difficult for some individuals with T2DM to initiate, or&#xD;
      adhere to, these lifestyle interventions. Alternative approaches to treatment are therefore&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research project is to investigate whether 10-days of overnight exposure&#xD;
      to moderate hypoxia is effective at improving blood glucose control in individuals with T2DM&#xD;
      and to provide insight into the physiological mechanisms responsible for any beneficial&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic condition characterized by progressive insulin&#xD;
      resistance and chronic hyperglycemia (high blood glucose concentrations). Hyperglycaemia&#xD;
      increases the risk of both micro- and macrovascular damage, whilst interventions that reduce&#xD;
      blood glucose mitigate this risk. Weight loss, achieved through exercise and dietary&#xD;
      modification, is effective at reducing hyperglycaemia. However, despite the clear benefits of&#xD;
      exercise and weight loss, diverse psychological, sociological and logistical factors can make&#xD;
      it difficult for some individuals with T2DM to initiate, or adhere to, these lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions. With the number of people with T2DM continuing to rise, this pandemic is&#xD;
      expected to reach 700 million people by 2045. Thus, there is a clear need for cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions that can effectively improve glycaemic control in people with T2DM and which&#xD;
      people will adhere to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple exposure to a lowered concentration of inspired oxygen (i.e. hypoxia) may represent&#xD;
      such an intervention. In addition to the beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis that have&#xD;
      been reported following a single acute hypoxic exposure, repeated intermittent, or&#xD;
      continuous, hypoxic exposure may also have therapeutic potential in individuals with T2DM. In&#xD;
      rodent models, daily hypoxic exposures returned fasting blood [glucose] to normal levels and&#xD;
      increased glucose transporter 4 translocation in mice with T2DM. Similar effects on glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis have been shown in overweight humans and those with insulin resistance, (during&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxic training) which was explained, at least in part, by reduction in body&#xD;
      mass (~ 1.2 kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms underpinning the improved glycaemic control in response to hypoxia are likely&#xD;
      multifactorial. Specifically, our objective is to assess a novel therapeutic intervention for&#xD;
      the treatment and management of T2DM which overcomes many of the barriers to uptake and&#xD;
      adherence that are associated with some lifestyle interventions such as exercise and weight&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
