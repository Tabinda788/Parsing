    <textblock>
      This clinical trial investigates the effects of switching from smoking regular cigarettes to&#xD;
      electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) among older adult smokers at high risk for lung cancer.&#xD;
      E-cigarettes use heated vapor to deliver nicotine. Information gained from this trial may&#xD;
      help inform regulators of the potential risks and benefits of switching smokers at high risk&#xD;
      for lung cancer to electronic cigarettes. This research also may help inform the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) how best to regulate e-cigarettes with the goal of improving public&#xD;
      health.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the effects of switching from combustible cigarettes (CCs) to e-cigarettes&#xD;
      (ECs) on product use, product acceptability, and reinforcement among adult daily CC smokers&#xD;
      at high risk for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the effects of switching from CCs to ECs on biomarkers of inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress among adult daily CC smokers at high for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize metabolomic changes that result from switching from CCs to ECs among CC&#xD;
      smokers at high risk for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To character which factors moderate or mediate the effects of switching from CCs to ECs&#xD;
      among CC smokers at high risk for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Participants smoke their usual brand of cigarettes for 26 weeks. Participants use&#xD;
      smartphone to answer questions about nicotine cravings and mood, and log daily smoking&#xD;
      activity every day for up to 182 days. Participants complete questionnaires over 50 minutes&#xD;
      and undergo collection of urine sample at 1, 6, 12, and 26 weeks, and collection of blood&#xD;
      samples at 6, 12, and 26 weeks. Participants may also undergo measurement of CO levels at 1,&#xD;
      6, 12, and 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Participants vape e-cigarettes for 26 weeks. Participants use smartphone to answer&#xD;
      questions about nicotine cravings and mood, and log daily smoking activity every day for up&#xD;
      to 182 days. Participants complete questionnaires over 50 minutes and undergo collection of&#xD;
      urine sample at 1, 6, 12, and 26 weeks, and collection of blood samples at 6, 12, and 26&#xD;
      weeks. Participants may also undergo measurement of CO levels at 1, 6, 12, and 26 weeks.&#xD;
