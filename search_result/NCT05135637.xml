  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) are an area of concern in Pakistan with many&#xD;
      health and nutrition indicators at sub-optimal levels. Although these indicators are slowly&#xD;
      improving, the interruption of health and immunization programs due to COVID-19 is projected&#xD;
      to have severe impacts on the health of women and children. The purpose of this pilot is to&#xD;
      test an integrated strategy of implementing immunization, primary health care, and nutrition&#xD;
      services in a high-risk setting of Pakistan.&#xD;

      Study Design: The project will adopt a quasi-experimental prepost study design to assess the&#xD;
      impact of the proposed interventions. The three union councils (UCs) are the intervention&#xD;
      sites and for each of these target UCs, a separate, matched control UC of comparable size,&#xD;
      location and coverage indicators will be identified, with propensity score matching and in&#xD;
      consultation with local partners. Baseline and endline surveys will be conducted using the&#xD;
      30x7 techniques. 30 clusters demarcated by the government's polio program from each UC will&#xD;
      be randomly selected and 15 households with children under-five selected from each cluster.&#xD;
      Thus, to achieve an optimal sample size, 450 households will be surveyed from each of the&#xD;
      intervention and control UCs. The survey will focus on household characteristics,&#xD;
      immunization coverage, health &amp; care-seeking behaviours, and WASH practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Strategies Naunehal aims to improve health service delivery and enhance uptake,&#xD;
      by focusing on four main intervention strategies to be implemented in all three target UCs;&#xD;
      community mobilization to enhance awareness and demand, mobile health teams offering MNCH and&#xD;
      immunization services, engagement of private sector to increase immunization coverage and&#xD;
      testing of a comprehensive health, nutrition, growth, and immunization app, Sehat Nishani.&#xD;
      The target group of the project include women of reproductive age (WRA) (15-49 years) and&#xD;
      children under-five residing in the UCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community engagement and mobilization will include dissemination of comprehensive messaging&#xD;
      on promotion of routine childhood immunization, ideal breastfeeding practices, handwashing,&#xD;
      best possible sanitary practices, COVID-prevention, optimal diarrheal management with oral&#xD;
      rehydration therapy and zinc supplementation, and appropriate care seeking for both pregnant&#xD;
      women and young children. The messages will be communicated via health promotion materials,&#xD;
      health awareness sessions, and mosque announcements. Announcements would especially encourage&#xD;
      the community for routine childhood immunization and to utilize Naunehal mobile health&#xD;
      service, the engaged private practitioners' clinics or government facilities for&#xD;
      immunization. An integral step of the community engagement process would be to map and&#xD;
      consult with opinion leaders and influential community members, to introduce the project and&#xD;
      gain their support for the activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile health services (MHS) will be deployed in each of the three pilot UCs, with one team&#xD;
      per UC in this pilot phase. Each mobile team will have a female physician, a female&#xD;
      vaccinator, and a facilitator and will visit pre-determined areas of the UC daily, for 06&#xD;
      days per week for 12 months. The locations will keep rotating, with an effort to focus on&#xD;
      underserved areas where access to and coverage of health facilities is limited. The team will&#xD;
      ensure that all COVID-19 -prevention recommendations of the government are followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MHS will provide basic health services, immunization, and health and nutrition&#xD;
      counselling targeted towards neonates, young children under-five and WRAs. The services&#xD;
      provided by the team are limited to those already approved and recommended by the Pakistan&#xD;
      government. Consent will be taken from caregivers and participants so that details on&#xD;
      services delivered can be shared and utilized in study analysis. Participants will receive&#xD;
      services regardless of whether consent is given or not. Personal identifiers will be removed&#xD;
      from data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project does not anticipate any major adverse event as routine vaccines are widely used&#xD;
      safely. However, guidance will be provided to the team physician on steps to follow in case&#xD;
      of an adverse event, including providing emergency medication, stabilization, subsequent&#xD;
      referral to a health facility if needed, following up on the child, and directive to return&#xD;
      to camp after 24-48 hours for check up. Serious and/or unexpected adverse events will be&#xD;
      evaluated and reported to Aga Khan University (AKU) and SickKids. The information on all&#xD;
      events will be collected, assessed, and reported on CRFs (Case Report Forms) through routine&#xD;
      reporting. If any subject suffers any injury while receiving care, he/she will receive free&#xD;
      of cost appropriate care as required and the organization will bear the cost of this care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Private Sector Engagement is an innovative strategy the project will introduce in the&#xD;
      intervention UCs. Naunehal aims to create a replicable model of private sector engagement&#xD;
      that can be adopted by the government for long-term sustainability. Private sector healthcare&#xD;
      providers (HCPs) including medical practitioners and physicians in the target UCs will be&#xD;
      taken on board to increase coverage of routine immunization and improve the quality of&#xD;
      maternal and child health services. HCPs will offer age-appropriate routine vaccination,&#xD;
      including missed doses, to all under-five children visiting their clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of HCPs will occur during the line listing of the baseline survey, and the&#xD;
      engaged HCPs will be trained in collaboration with the District Health Office and the&#xD;
      Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Training will primarily focus on immunization of&#xD;
      neonates and young children as per the schedule and methods endorsed by EPI. Safety&#xD;
      protocols, cold chain maintenance and vaccination recordkeeping will be an integral component&#xD;
      of the training program. As well, the HCPs will be trained on use of Naunehal health&#xD;
      promotion materials as well as counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project team will liaison with EPI to arrange vaccines for the private practitioners and&#xD;
      supply them on a regular, as-needed basis. The arrangement will ensure that vaccines are&#xD;
      ready to be picked up or delivered on a pre-determined day from the EPI office with&#xD;
      cold-chain maintenance preparations to the practitioners' clinic. These will include BCG,&#xD;
      oral polio vaccine (OPV), injectable polio vaccine (IPV), Pentavalent, Pneumococcal, Measles&#xD;
      and Rotavirus vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An incentive for the practitioners would be that they would receive much promotion and&#xD;
      exposure within the UC, during community mobilization and public announcements. As well, it&#xD;
      will be an opportunity for them to build linkages with the community and with government&#xD;
      partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sehat Nishani App will be launched in the three intervention UCs to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      adopting a birth, health, and immunization app to create a vaccination database and capture&#xD;
      information on birth, birth weight, nutrition and growth records essential for follow up of&#xD;
      the cohort. Lady health workers (LHWs), lady health visitors (LHVs) in government health&#xD;
      facilities, EPI vaccinators and partnering HCPs will be engaged to use the Sehat Nishani app&#xD;
      on their existing Android phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health workers will receive the necessary orientation and training to use the app and&#xD;
      will receive technical support if needed from the project team. Health workers will have app&#xD;
      access via a unique login identity (ID) and password and thus, the app will not be publicly&#xD;
      accessible. Data from a single family will be linked via a unique Family ID also accessible&#xD;
      via an assigned QR code. While LHWs and HCPs will enter both vaccination and health data for&#xD;
      under-two children and WRAs, the vaccinators will only enter vaccination data. Health data&#xD;
      for children will include birth history, nutritional history, growth record, and an illness&#xD;
      record. For WRAs, in addition to the nutritional and illness history, the app will be&#xD;
      designed to record details on antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care. Caregivers would&#xD;
      be able to log in to the app with their unique ID number and see their child's record without&#xD;
      making any changes or entering any information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      App records will be stored in a cloud-based central database managed by AKU, where child&#xD;
      health and nutrition data, vaccinator performance, vaccination rates, children overdue for&#xD;
      vaccination, and under-immunized areas can be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Impact Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naunehal will undergo rigorous monitoring and evaluation, which will include the following&#xD;
      activities. As mentioned, household surveys will be conducted at baseline and at then at the&#xD;
      end of the project to assess the impact of interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mother &amp; Child Care Trust (MCCT) will conduct an independent monitoring and evaluation of&#xD;
      the project. MCCT will track the impact of the project using a range of indicators including&#xD;
      the number of births registered, birth dose of OPV and BCG received, receipt rates of&#xD;
      pneumococcal conjugate (PCV) and measles vaccine, full immunization rates, and zero dose&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A household baseline, midline and endline assessment will be conducted for evaluating&#xD;
      coverage of interventions as well as the knowledge, attitude, and practices of the community&#xD;
      in the maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) and COVID-19 context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for a household would include consent from the family, at least one&#xD;
      child less than 5 years of age in the household, and that the family has been living in that&#xD;
      particular high-risk UC for at least 6 months (including the child in the household) prior to&#xD;
      the day of the interview. However, the household will be eligible even if the only child in&#xD;
      household was born in the last six months. Any household where a parent or caregiver is not&#xD;
      available to answer questions related to the child's health and immunization, will be&#xD;
      excluded. Data collected will be processed and analyzed at the AKU, Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surveys will help to develop a comprehensive picture of population distribution, health&#xD;
      intervention and immunization coverage for children under-5 years. The baseline will also&#xD;
      serve as the basis for targeting and tracking progress. Given the enormous impact that&#xD;
      COVID-19 related mitigation strategies have had on routine health services such as antenatal&#xD;
      care, childbirth services, immunizations and care seeking, this baseline assessment will also&#xD;
      assess bottlenecks and help tailor possible approaches to address these issues.&#xD;
