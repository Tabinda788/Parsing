  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children with haemophilia will be invited to complete 3 questionnaires to look for&#xD;
      traits present in ASD. With consent teacher will complete a further 2 questionnaires. If all&#xD;
      3 questionnaires are above threshold, then with consent of the family the child will be&#xD;
      referred for further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are already pre-existing children with ASD who will be exempt from the study, but&#xD;
      included in the data analysis of prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the 3 questionnaires will be used to identify a profile of social&#xD;
      communication in children with haemophilia.&#xD;

      Background Haemophilia A and B are inherited disorders characterised by spontaneous bleeding.&#xD;
      The current treatment is replacement of the deficient factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX).&#xD;
      Haemophilia occurs in 1:50000 male births and approximately 85% have haemophilia A and approx&#xD;
      15% haemophilia B. Children with haemophilia can be described as having severe, moderate or&#xD;
      mild disease dependent on their circulating levels of FVIII or FIX. Children with severe&#xD;
      haemophilia are classified as having &lt;1%, moderate 1-5% and mild &gt;5-40%. One third of all&#xD;
      children diagnosed with haemophilia have no family history of the bleeding disorder. 80% of&#xD;
      bleeding episodes occur in the joints. A bleed into the cranial cavity although rare is&#xD;
      called an intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and outcome can range from neurological impairment&#xD;
      (behavioural difficulties) to death (1-2). Bladen et al. 2009 identified behavioural&#xD;
      difficulties in a cohort of children at Great Ormond St Hospital for Children NHS Trust with&#xD;
      haemophilia following intracranial haemorrhage (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemophilia and communication difficulties A recent study has highlighted that boys with&#xD;
      haemophilia risk attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) spectrum difficulties&#xD;
      especially hyperactivity impulsivity (HI) and special education participation (4). No papers&#xD;
      could be found detailing a relationship or prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder and&#xD;
      haemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the Bladen et al. 2009 publication there has been an increased awareness and diagnosis&#xD;
      of boys with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) at Great Ormond St Hospital for Children NHS&#xD;
      Trust haemophilia centre. These problems have required the children to gain statements of&#xD;
      special education need in order that they can maximise their educational potential. Children&#xD;
      with ASD can also present with motor co-ordination difficulties that increase their risk of&#xD;
      falls. This tendency to lack control of their movement may increase bleeding frequency in&#xD;
      boys with haemophilia placing them at further risk. It is essential that these boys are&#xD;
      screened and identified early so that the necessary additional these children require is&#xD;
      attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current literature states that ASD affects approximately 1% of the general population (5-6).&#xD;
      Autism-spectrum disorders are diagnosed by the presence of social and communication&#xD;
      difficulties, alongside unusually strong, narrow interests and/or repetitive and stereotyped&#xD;
      behaviour (7). Language delay and difficulties in cognitive ability are common in children&#xD;
      and may extend into below-average range intellectual disabilities. For clinical purposes&#xD;
      diagnosis is set at the level where autistic traits are significantly interfering in daily&#xD;
      life functioning; currently, there is no biological marker and the diagnosis is established&#xD;
      on a basis of a comprehensive assessment of children's behavioural characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The aim of this study is to use questionnaires to be completed by parents&#xD;
      and teachers to screen and assess for difficulties in social interactions, executive&#xD;
      functioning, communication and behaviour in boys with haemophilia aged 5-16 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will establish if there is a higher prevalence of symptoms of ASD and executive&#xD;
      function difficulties in boys with haemophilia than the general population. This knowledge&#xD;
      will assist education management strategies to help those affected boys maximise their&#xD;
      educational potential through appropriate schooling support. Highlighting ASD symptoms may&#xD;
      aid early diagnosis and facilitate earlier management strategies e.g. a statement of special&#xD;
      of educational need if required. The proposed study intends to identify if the increased&#xD;
      number of children we have with ASD is an artefact or if indeed there is a higher prevalence&#xD;
      of ASD in children with haemophilia. If these findings are substantiated then in the future&#xD;
      all children with haemophilia will be screened for ASD as appropriate. Children with above&#xD;
      threshold scores on all 3 questionnaire scores would then be referred locally for further&#xD;
      psychological assessment and possible diagnosis . All children referred locally for further&#xD;
      psychological assessment will be followed up to ascertain if a diagnosis is made as per&#xD;
      routine clinical practice. An earlier diagnosis would hopefully ensure that the child and&#xD;
      family receive earlier support and maximise the child's potential. It is anticipated that the&#xD;
      completion of this study will help improve the overall care and management of boys with&#xD;
      haemophilia and autistic spectrum disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Subjects aged 5-16 years with haemophilia will be identified from Great Ormond St&#xD;
      hospital for children NHS Trust haemophilia database. Subjects less than 5 years of age, over&#xD;
      16 years of age, with other bleeding disorders or those already with a diagnosis of ASD will&#xD;
      be excluded. The study population is parents of boys with a diagnosis of haemophilia aged&#xD;
      5-16 years of age. It is hoped there will be 100 eligible subjects to take part as the total&#xD;
      cohort is 149. Parents of children aged 5-16 years of age will be contacted by letter two&#xD;
      weeks before their scheduled haemophilia review (see attached) to invite them to participate&#xD;
      in the questionnaire research and they will also be provided with an information leaflet with&#xD;
      the invite On attendance at the haemophilia centre if the family agree to participate,&#xD;
      consent will be obtained (see attached Parent consent form). This will include consent to&#xD;
      contact the child's head teacher, class teacher and the G.P. It is acknowledged that parents&#xD;
      may experience increased anxiety whether their child has problems or not and as such it is&#xD;
      essential the GP is aware of the family's participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those parents who are unable to read or speak English an interpreter will be provided.&#xD;
      Arrangement of an interpreter would be pre-booked for their review appointment as normal.&#xD;
      Completion of the form shall be assisted by another member of the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent has been obtained, the child's head teacher and class teacher will be contacted&#xD;
      with a letter along with a teachers information sheet (see attached) and a copy of the signed&#xD;
      consent form. This will inform them of the study and invite them to participate. The class&#xD;
      teacher should have known the child for more than 3 months As well as the questionnaires&#xD;
      additional information will be gathered from the medical notes and parents, such as birth&#xD;
      history, current medication, educational status e.t.c.(for all the items please see attached&#xD;
      Additional information sheet) The following questionnaires have been shown to be reliable and&#xD;
      valid for screening for children with ASD, The Social Communication Questionnaire, The&#xD;
      Childrens Communication Checklist (CCC-2) and the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive&#xD;
      Function (BRIEF). All questionnaires have normative data for comparison and as such a control&#xD;
      group is not required. These 3 will be completed by the parent on the day of the assessment,&#xD;
      whilst their child is receiving their routine musculoskeletal assessment. The BRIEF and CCC&#xD;
      questionnaires will be sent with the teachers invitation for them to complete. A follow up&#xD;
      telephone call will be made to the teacher to discuss any questions they may have .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) (8) The SCQ is a brief instrument that can be&#xD;
      used to evaluate children over 4 years of age as long as his or her mental age exceeds 2&#xD;
      years of age. The questionnaire takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. The&#xD;
      questionnaire focuses on behaviours that are rare in non-affected individuals and can be used&#xD;
      as a screener for autistic spectrum disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Communication Questionnaire is a 40 item yes/no response parent-report&#xD;
      questionnaire that asks about characteristic autistic behaviour. There are 2 forms; the&#xD;
      autoscore looking at behaviour in the last 3 months and the lifetime score. The total score&#xD;
      is a combination of the autoscore and lifetime score and is interpreted in relation to&#xD;
      cut-off scores that indicate the likelihood of an individual having ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The items are scored as either 0 or 1. A score of 1 is an endorsement for each symptom of&#xD;
      autism. The range of scores is from 0-39 as the first item the language score is not included&#xD;
      in the total score. Nineteen items rate current behaviour and 20 rate behaviour when the&#xD;
      child was 4-5 years old. The recommended cut-off score for autistic-spectrum disorder or&#xD;
      pervasive developmental disorder is &gt;15. The SCQ has been found to have a high discriminant&#xD;
      ability in differentiating ASD symptomatology from other associated behavioural and&#xD;
      developmental difficulties. (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) (10) Executive functioning is&#xD;
      a collection of functions that are responsible for guiding, directing and managing cognitive,&#xD;
      emotional and behavioural functions particularly during active, novel problem solving. The&#xD;
      term executive function is an umbrella term to describe a collection of inter-related&#xD;
      functions that are responsible for purposeful, goal directed problem-solving behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRIEF questionnaire is for parents and teachers of school-aged children that enables&#xD;
      professionals to assess executive functioning at home and in the school environments.&#xD;
      Answering if any of the statements have applied to the child in the past 6 months. It is&#xD;
      designed for children aged 5-18 years of age, and recommended for use with children with a&#xD;
      wide range of developmental and neurological conditions, such as ADHD and ASD, who have been&#xD;
      identified to be at an increased risk of possible executive function difficulties, including&#xD;
      those with learning disabilities, attentional disorders and brain injuries. The questionnaire&#xD;
      will take 10- 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRIEF contains 86 items within eight theoretically and empirically derived clinical&#xD;
      scales that measure and monitor different aspects of executive functioning: inhibit, shift,&#xD;
      emotional control, initiate, working memory, plan/organise, organisation of materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibit - Assesses inhibitory control i.e. the ability to inhibit, resist or not act on ones&#xD;
      impulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shift- Assesses the ability to move freely from one situation or activity or aspect of a&#xD;
      problem to another as circumstances demand (problem solving).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional control - Assesses the ability to modulate emotional control i.e. emotional&#xD;
      lability or emotional explosiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiate - Assesses items relating to beginning a task or activity as well as independently&#xD;
      generating ideas, responses or problem solving strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working memory - Assesses the capacity to hold on to information in mind for the purpose of&#xD;
      completing a task. Working memory is essential to carry out multistep activities, complete&#xD;
      mental arithmetic or follow complex instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan / organise - Assesses the child's ability to manage current and future-orientated tasks.&#xD;
      The plan element takes in to consideration an ability to anticipate future events, set goals&#xD;
      and set appropriate steps to complete the task. The organise component involves assessing&#xD;
      written and oral information to bring order to information and to appreciate the main ideas&#xD;
      or concepts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organisation of materials - Assesses a child's orderliness of work, play and storage space.&#xD;
      This may also take into consideration how order is brought about.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRIEF has been shown to have good reliability and validity (10-11). The Childrens&#xD;
      Communication Checklist (CCC-2) (12-13) This questionnaire is a 70 item questionnaire which&#xD;
      has standard scores and percentiles and can be completed by the parent or teacher The&#xD;
      questionnaire asks about language and communication. Scoring an item is broken down into 0&#xD;
      ('does not apply'), 1 ('applies somewhat'), 2 ('definitely applies') or missing value&#xD;
      ('unable to judge'). This questionnaire will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCC-2 is divided into 9 subscales: two sub-scales assess aspects of language structure&#xD;
      (syntax and speech); two assess aspects of autistic behaviour (social relationships and&#xD;
      interests); and five assess aspects of pragmatic communication (inappropriate initiation,&#xD;
      coherence, stereotyped conversation, use of context, and rapport), which has been found to be&#xD;
      impaired in children with ASD. The raw scores of the subscales are converted to aged scaled&#xD;
      scores with a mean of 10 and a std of 3. These aged scaled scores and the GCC are converted&#xD;
      to percentiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCC-2 (12) has a pragmatic composite sub-scale that has been shown to distinguish between&#xD;
      those individuals with and without autistic spectrum disorder (14). The CCC-2 has been used&#xD;
      in the literature to identify children with communication impairments from non-impaired peers&#xD;
      (15). (See attached for copies of the questionnaires proposed) The supervision and scoring of&#xD;
      these questionnaires shall be undertaken by Marianna Murin, Clinical Psychologist who works&#xD;
      in the social communication team at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust. The&#xD;
      supervision will consist of an initial training session, followed by observed practical&#xD;
      sessions. The administration of the questionnaires will be carried out by the primary&#xD;
      investigator and Nicola Hubert Physiotherapy colleague.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A score on a screening instrument is indicative of a probable Autism Spectrum Disorder,&#xD;
      however it is not sufficient for a formal diagnosis. For diagnostic assessment a full&#xD;
      parental interview regarding current and past development and behaviour, and structured&#xD;
      observation of the child, preferably including a peer-group setting, is essential. Those&#xD;
      children with questionnaire results that suggest further assessment is required will be&#xD;
      discussed with Marianna Murin. The family shall be informed by telephone of the concerns&#xD;
      raised from the assessment, either by Marianna Murin, the primary investigator or Nicola&#xD;
      Hubert physiotherapy colleague. The report will be written and sent to the family. In&#xD;
      consultation and consent with the family a referral to a local psychologist via the GP or&#xD;
      local paediatrician will be made to facilitate further assessments and establish a diagnosis&#xD;
      along with appropriate intervention and support. In the unlikely event of a lost referral /&#xD;
      lost letter the primary investigator will follow up all children referred to local services&#xD;
      to ensure the referral is received and the outcome of their assessments is known. This would&#xD;
      follow current clinical practice. Those children with no indication for ongoing assessment&#xD;
      will not receive a report, but a letter that states there is no indication for further&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results The time scale from invitation to receipt of a letter detailing the outcome of the&#xD;
      assessment shall take approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of the results have been discussed with Angie Wade in the Institute of Child Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research within the haemophilia unit has demonstrated a high rate of return with&#xD;
      this population group and as such a 5-10% drop out rate is typical of previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation provided has considered that some individuals may decline to&#xD;
      participate. Based on a sample of 140 out of 149 subjects, we expect at-least 10% to test&#xD;
      positive. We would estimate this to + or - 5%. At most we anticipate 33% testing positive and&#xD;
      in this case the precision would be + or - 8%. Therefore the sample provides sufficient&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall results of the study shall be published in a peer review journal. A summary of&#xD;
      the overall findings shall be published in the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS&#xD;
      Trust Haemophilia Centre newsletter that is distributed to all families with a child with&#xD;
      haemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study It is anticipated that data collection will take 1 year and will start in&#xD;
      January 2013 and be completed January 2014. Data analysis should be completed by July 2014.&#xD;
