  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin condition that may cause a rash and itching due to&#xD;
      inflammation of the skin. Therapies spread over the skin may not be enough to control the AD&#xD;
      in trial participants who require systemic anti-inflammatory treatment. This study will&#xD;
      assess the real-world effectiveness of upadacitinib on early and sustained response along&#xD;
      adolescent and adult participants with AD. This study also aims to understand upadacitinib&#xD;
      utilization patterns in real-world clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upadacitinib (RINVOQ) is approved in the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in&#xD;
      adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.&#xD;
      Approximately 772 adolescent and adult participants with AD will be enrolled at up to 200&#xD;
      sites in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral upadacitinib tablets as prescribed by the physician prior to&#xD;
      enrolling in this study in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization and&#xD;
      professional and reimbursement guidelines with regards to dose, population, and indication.&#xD;
      The overall duration of the study is approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend regular visits per routine clinical practice. The effect of the&#xD;
      treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects, and&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) are each assessed for severity by the investigator on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement is assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk (including the genital area), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks), and converted to a score of 0 to 6. The EASI score ranges from 0-72 points with an MCID of 6.6 points. Published score bands: clear (0), almost clear (0.1-1.0), mild AD (1.1-7.0), moderate AD (7.1-21.0), severe AD (21.1-50.0), very severe AD (50.1-72.0).</description>

    <description>vIGA-AD is a validated assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally. A 5-point scale is used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the investigator's evaluation of the participant ranging from 0 - Clear (no inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis (no erythema, no induration/papulation, no lichenification, no oozing/crusting). Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation may be present.) to 4 - Severe (marked erythema (deep or bright red), marked induration/papulation, and/or marked lichenification.</description>

    <measure>Incidence and Type of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug but within 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>
