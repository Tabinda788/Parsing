      This study aims to assess the impact of brief digitally delivered breathing practice and&#xD;
      guided meditation on post-Covid physical and mental symptoms in Long Covid Patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long Covid symptoms can last weeks to months after the initial Covid infection or can appear&#xD;
      weeks after. It can occur in those with mild disease or asymptomatic patients. Most commonly&#xD;
      reported symptoms of Long Covid are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tiredness or fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as &quot;brain fog&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Headache&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of smell or taste&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dizziness on standing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cough&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Joint or muscle pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression or anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this date, nearly 180 million people have been infected with Covid19 and over 3 million&#xD;
      have lost their lives worldwide. The increasing prevalence of patients with Long Covid&#xD;
      symptoms and the lack of effective solutions to address their condition, creates an urgent&#xD;
      need for non-pharmacological interventions that are effective and scalable and can be&#xD;
      delivered online to accommodate for the limitations due to the Covid pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yogic Breathing and Meditation techniques have been shown to have various health benefits&#xD;
      including improving pulmonary function and mental health. Prominent health institutions are&#xD;
      recommending breathing exercise to their Covid patients to assist their respiratory&#xD;
      recovery9. Meditation and breathing is also shown to help with Covid related stress and&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a waitlisted randomized controlled trial conducted in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: If participants are in the intervention group, they will be asked to learn and&#xD;
      practices two Yogic Breathing practices (Simha Kriya and Nadi Shuddhi) and a guided&#xD;
      meditation (Isha Kriya) for 3 weeks They will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline and the end of each week. Participants in the waitlisted control group will be asked&#xD;
      to perform their regular daily routine as they wait to be enrolled into the intervention at&#xD;
      the end of 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: The waitlisted control group will begin the intervention at week 3 and continue&#xD;
      until week 6. They will be asked to continue completing the questionnaires at the end of each&#xD;
      week. The intervention group will be asked to complete a final follow-up questionnaire at the&#xD;
      end of week 6.&#xD;

    <measure>Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>For Phase 1 analysis: Baseline to 3 weeks. For Phase 2 analysis: Baseline to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly compliance questionnaire is a tool which helps the participants to keep track of their activities each week. This enables the study team to measure compliance and protocol adherence by the participants by collecting information on their routine activity practiced and its frequency. This will be reported in &quot;Number of days an intervention was practiced in a week&quot;. Participants completing at least 3 days of activity would be considered as compliant for that week.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>For Phase 1 analysis: Baseline to 3 weeks. For Phase 2 analysis: Baseline to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PSS is a 10-question validated instrument that assesses stress. Participants are asked to rate on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (very often) how often they agree with various statements.</description>

    <measure>Profile of Mood States (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>For Phase 1 analysis: Baseline to 3 weeks. For Phase 2 analysis: Baseline to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a short validated survey used to measure six different dimensions of mood swings over a period of time. These include: Tension or Anxiety, Anger or Hostility, Vigor or Activity, Fatigue or Inertia, Depression or Dejection, Confusion or Bewilderment. A five-point scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot; is administered and scores for each dimension contributes to calculation of positive and negative subscales in conjunction to total mood disturbance.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Survey (SF12)</measure>
    <time_frame>For Phase 1 analysis: Baseline to 3 weeks. For Phase 2 analysis: Baseline to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>SF12 is a validated self-reported measure of the impact of health on everyday quality of life. It evaluates domains of physical activities, social activities, usual role activities, bodily pain, general mental health, vitality and general health perception.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP)</measure>
    <time_frame>For Phase 1 analysis: Baseline to 3 weeks. For Phase 2 analysis: Baseline to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>MDP is a validated scale to assess the overall breathing discomfort, sensory qualities and emotional responses using 8 questions. It is not intended for a particular activity and can be used during rest, activity or during clinical care. For assessing Long Covid patients, the first three parts (breathing discomfort and sensory qualities) are commonly used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Somatic Symptom Scale 8 Items (SS8)</measure>
    <time_frame>For Phase 1 analysis: Baseline to 3 weeks. For Phase 2 analysis: Baseline to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>SS8 is a validated brief questionnaire to assess common somatic symptoms including pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue and trouble sleeping. Participants are asked to rate on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) how often they agree with various statements. Items from each of the 8 questions are then summed to create a total perceived stress score.</description>
