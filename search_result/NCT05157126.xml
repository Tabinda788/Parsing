  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local application of antibiotics directly to the traumatic wound is a promising treatment for&#xD;
      the prevention of infection after open tibia fractures, which are a significant source of&#xD;
      disease burden globally, particularly in low-income countries. This study aims to measure the&#xD;
      effect of locally applied gentamicin on risk of infection for open tibial fractures in&#xD;
      Tanzania. If proven effective, local gentamicin would be a highly cost-effective strategy to&#xD;
      reduce complications and disability from open tibial fractures that could impact care in both&#xD;
      high- and low-income countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tibial shaft (shinbone) fractures are the most common major fracture of the lower leg and are&#xD;
      frequently associated with a break in the skin known as an open fracture. Because the bone is&#xD;
      exposed by the open wound, open tibial fractures are often complicated by infection and&#xD;
      failure of bone healing, which can lead to long-lasting disability and in some cases&#xD;
      amputation. Intravenous antibiotics administered early after injury are a well-established&#xD;
      measure to prevent fracture-related infection (FRI), but their effectiveness is limited by&#xD;
      poor blood flow at the fracture site and inability to achieve high local concentrations with&#xD;
      systemic administration. Gentamicin applied locally within the open fracture wound is a&#xD;
      promising adjunctive measure to reduce the risk of FRI after these injuries, but there are no&#xD;
      high-quality clinical trials evaluating its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first randomized trial evaluating locally administered gentamicin to reduce&#xD;
      infection in a fracture population. If efficacious, local gentamicin is likely to be a highly&#xD;
      cost-effective preventive strategy for FRI and may ultimately be cost saving. Although these&#xD;
      findings will originate from a low-income country, results may be generalizable to&#xD;
      populations in both high and low-income countries and could therefore significantly reduce&#xD;
      the global burden of open fractures.&#xD;

    <measure>Occurrence of fracture-related infection (FRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fracture-related infection is a consensus definition of infection after fracture treatment. It is diagnosed by an orthopaedic surgeon based on any of the following four diagnostic criteria: (1) fistula, sinus or wound breakdown; (2) purulent drainage from the wound or presence of pus during surgery; (3) phenotypically indistinguishable pathogens identified by culture from at least two separate deep tissue/implant specimens; or (4) presence of microorganisms in deep tissue taken during an operative intervention, as seen on histopathological examination.&#xD;
FRI diagnosis is likely to peak between 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery and has a non-normal time-to-event distribution, with incident cases rarely presenting later than 12 months after surgery. All events will be confirmed by an independent adjudication committee comprised of three masked, non-treating orthopaedic trauma surgeons.</description>
