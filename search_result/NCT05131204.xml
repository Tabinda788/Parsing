  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy on hemolysis, as&#xD;
      assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), after 36 weeks of treatment, in patients with PNH&#xD;
      who switch from eculizumab or ravulizumab therapy versus patients who continue their&#xD;
      eculizumab or ravulizumab therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination treatment versus anti-C5&#xD;
           standard-of-care treatment (eculizumab or ravulizumab) on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transfusion requirements and transfusion parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measures of hemolysis: LDH control, breakthrough hemolysis, and inhibition of CH50&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fatigue as assessed by Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by COAs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety and tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the concentrations of total pozelimab and either total eculizumab or total&#xD;
           ravulizumab in serum and total cemdisiran and total C5 protein in plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of pozelimab and cemdisiran&#xD;

    <measure>Change in fatigue as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 36</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13 item, self-administered clinical outcome assessment (COA) assessing an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. This questionnaire is part of the FACIT measurement system, a compilation of questions measuring health related quality of life (QoL) in patients with cancer and other chronic illnesses. The FACIT-Fatigue assesses the level of fatigue using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>

    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including global health status/quality of life, functional Scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Participants rate items on a 4-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot;</description>
