  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are intersecting&#xD;
      diseases that add substantially to the global burden of disease and mortality. AALD refers to&#xD;
      a spectrum of liver tissue injury caused by chronic and excessive alcohol use. Although&#xD;
      reducing drinking is a main treatment goal, this is often unachievable for many AALD patients&#xD;
      due to an underlying AUD characterized by craving, negative affect, and alcohol seeking&#xD;
      despite harms. While numerous, high-quality studies demonstrate effectiveness of brief&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions for AUD, few trials have tested the efficacy of psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions to reduce drinking in AALD patients. This study unites a team of addiction&#xD;
      scientists and hepatologists to form a partnership for future work testing AUD interventions&#xD;
      integrated with AALD care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a brief&#xD;
      motivational intervention targeting alcohol use for patients with alcohol-associated liver&#xD;
      disease (AALD). The intervention will include personalized feedback from biomarkers of liver&#xD;
      function, drinking patterns, and self-monitoring via smartphone reports in daily life.&#xD;
      Participants (n=44) will exceed moderate drinking guidelines and will be recruited from local&#xD;
      hospitals and the community. This is a parallel group design in which all participants&#xD;
      receive the same intervention. Half of the participants will have AALD and meet criteria for&#xD;
      AUD, and half will have AUD only without evidence of advanced liver disease. The protocol&#xD;
      includes a 1-week screening phase, 3-week intervention phase, and 3-month follow-up. In&#xD;
      addition to demonstrating feasibility, this project aims to test whether behavioral&#xD;
      endophenotypes associated with alcohol-use outcomes in clinical trials are more resistant to&#xD;
      change during AUD intervention for AALD patients with AUD relative to those with AUD only. A&#xD;
      final aim is to explore biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation as mechanisms of&#xD;
      persistence of endophenotypes, specifically levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,&#xD;
      and others implicated in the pathogenesis of AALD.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Screen Eligible Who Enroll</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be evaluated through the percentage of those who are screened as eligible for the study who enroll as participants in the study. The target enrollment rate is greater than or equal to 60% of screen eligible.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Complete the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be evaluated through the percentage of those participants who are enrolled in the study who complete the study. The target retention rate is greater than or equal to 70% of enrolled participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Withdraw</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be evaluated through the percentage of those participants who enroll in the study who withdraw from the study. A participant is considered to have withdrawn from the study if they indicate that they no longer wish to be a part of the study (i.e., not lost to contact). The target withdrawal rate is less than or equal to 20% of enrolled participants.</description>

    <measure>Craving in Daily Life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a method for collecting self-monitoring data using smartphones. Participants will complete smartphone reports for a total of 4 weeks including a 1-week screening phase and 3-week intervention phase.Participants will self-monitor and rate the intensity of their alcohol craving in daily life. They will also indicate situational and contextual factors, including the presence of visible alcohol cues. Craving will be assessed using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 via the question, &quot;How strong is your craving to drink alcohol right now?&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Craving in the Human Laboratory</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be exposed to alcohol and water cues in the human laboratory via a standardized in vivo cue reactivity paradigm. The participant's typical alcoholic beverage is used as the in vivo alcohol cue. Each cue exposure lasts approximately 90 seconds. An initial relaxation period is followed by exposure to the water cue, and two repeated exposures to the alcohol cue. To match assessment of craving in daily life, craving will be assessed using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 via the question, &quot;How strong is your craving to drink alcohol right now?&quot;. Craving will also be assessed with the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire--Short Form-Revised (ACQ-SF-R), a 12-item self-administered, multidimensional state measure of acute alcohol craving.</description>
