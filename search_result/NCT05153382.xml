  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) will be conducted over 1 year in youth with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder (BD). DBT will be divided into two modalities: 1) DBT skills training; and 2) DBT&#xD;
      individual therapy sessions. Skills training sessions will incorporate the 5 standard&#xD;
      adolescent DBT modules: mindfulness skills, emotion regulation skills, distress tolerance&#xD;
      skills, interpersonal skills, and walking the middle path skills and an additional module on&#xD;
      psychoeducation about DBT and BD. This study seeks to build upon the knowledge base in this&#xD;
      area by offering DBT to youth with BD with an emphasis on predictors and mediators of&#xD;
      treatment outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, studies led by investigators at the University of Pittsburgh have emerged&#xD;
      that demonstrate the promise of adapting dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to align with the&#xD;
      unique needs of youth with bipolar disorder (BD). For the past two years, our group has been&#xD;
      conducting a dissemination and implementation DBT study at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre&#xD;
      focused specifically on youth with BD. Preliminary data from that study demonstrate that the&#xD;
      study therapists, now at CAMH, have achieved fidelity and competence in delivering the&#xD;
      intervention, as evidenced by adherence coding scores and participant outcomes. The DBT&#xD;
      intervention is based on Miller et al.'s DBT for suicidal adolescents, with modifications for&#xD;
      youth with BD. A co-investigator on this study, Dr. T. Goldstein, developed and refined the&#xD;
      manualized treatment during her National Institute of Mental Health K23 award in consultation&#xD;
      with Dr. Miller. In keeping with the protocol implemented in prior studies, DBT in the&#xD;
      present study will be conducted over 1 year, and divided into two modalities: 1) DBT skills&#xD;
      training (approximately 60 minute biweekly meetings); and 2) DBT individual therapy sessions&#xD;
      (approximately 60 minute biweekly sessions) alternating with skills training. Family&#xD;
      involvement in skills training will be strongly encouraged, but not mandatory. Master's level&#xD;
      therapists with clinical experience in youth with BD and their families will conduct DBT.&#xD;
      This study includes 1 year of assessments (intake, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) while the&#xD;
      intervention is being delivered. The target sample size will be 60 youth with BD ranging from&#xD;
      13 to 23 years of age. The current study endeavors to build upon the knowledge base in this&#xD;
      area by offering DBT to youth with BD at CAMH with an emphasis on predictors and mediators of&#xD;
      treatment outcomes, with the eventual goal of personalizing treatment selection and delivery.&#xD;
      While DBT bodes favorably as a treatment for youth with BD, the literature in this area&#xD;
      remains sparse. Moreover, the investigators do not yet understand what clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and pre-treatment variables predict and mediate treatment outcomes. There is&#xD;
      substantial between-person and within-person variability among youth with BD in terms of risk&#xD;
      indicators, type and severity of symptoms, associated distress, and compounding functional&#xD;
      impairment. The current study proposes to move beyond questions of efficacy toward&#xD;
      identifying individual characteristics that are differentially associated with response to&#xD;
      DBT. Identification of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics that are associated&#xD;
      with response to DBT (i.e., predictors), as well as time-varying characteristics during the&#xD;
      course of treatment (i.e., mediators), could guide iterative optimization of DBT through&#xD;
      individualized modifications. Patient engagement will be sought through consultation forums&#xD;
      after they have completed the study. Overall, this research endeavors to begin to examine the&#xD;
      patient factors that predict and mediate an individual's response to DBT, with important&#xD;
      questions to consider, such as: For which youth with BD does this intervention have the&#xD;
      greatest effect? Does the intervention have similar effects across sub-groups of youth with&#xD;
      BD? The investigators anticipate that the identification of predictor and mediating variables&#xD;
      has the potential to inform the iterative personalization of DBT for youth with BD in the&#xD;
      future, including content, timing, and relative emphasis on various aspects of DBT (e.g.,&#xD;
      psychoeducation, skills, individual sessions, family involvement, phone coaching).&#xD;

    <description>The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES-IV) was developed to evaluate the adaptability and cohesion dimensions in family interactions. Youth and parents will complete this self-report questionnaire. Six scales were developed, with two balanced scales and four unbalanced scales designed to tap low and high cohesion (disengaged and enmeshed) and flexibility (rigid and chaotic). Ratio scores above 1 indicate healthier families whereas ratio scores below 1 indicate more problematic families. The six scales in FACES-IV were found to be reliable and valid. Additionally, high levels of concurrent, construct, and discriminant validity were found.</description>

    <measure>Change in family functioning using the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale, IV (FACES-IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES-IV) was developed to evaluate the adaptability and cohesion dimensions in family interactions. Youth and parents will complete this self-report questionnaire. Six scales were developed, with two balanced scales and four unbalanced scales designed to tap low and high cohesion (disengaged and enmeshed) and flexibility (rigid and chaotic). Ratio scores above 1 indicate healthier families whereas ratio scores below 1 indicate more problematic families. The six scales in FACES-IV were found to be reliable and valid. Additionally, high levels of concurrent, construct, and discriminant validity were found.</description>

    <measure>Childhood Trust Events Survey (CTES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Youth will complete the Childhood Trust Events Survey (CTES) long-form, adolescent version, a 30-item self-report screening survey that assesses exposure to adversity across a breadth of domains including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; alcohol/drug users in home; family members in prison; caregiver with mental illness; domestic violence; loss/separation from caregiver; and other traumatic events. In addition, the CTES queries the age and perceived intensity of each type of adversity. Parents will complete the caregiver version of the CTES, a 26-item survey that asks if their child has been exposed to the same domains of adversity as queried in the adolescent version.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dialectical behavioral therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>DBT will be conducted over 1 year, and divided into two modalities: skills training, conducted in 60 minute biweekly meetings and individual therapy conducted in 60 minute biweekly sessions. Family participation in skills training is highly encouraged. Skills training proceeds as follows: psychoeducation, mindfulness skills, emotion regulation skills, distress tolerance skills, interpersonal skills, and walking the middle path skills. Individual therapy sessions aim to aid the youth in applying skills in their daily lives. We adopt the standard DBT hierarchy of treatment targets, whereby the individual therapist selects behaviors to focus on based on the following priorities: 1) decreasing life-threatening behaviors, 2) decreasing therapy-interfering behaviors, 3) decreasing quality-of-life interfering behaviors, and 4) increasing behavioral skills. Therapists will be available to participants by cell phone for in-vivo skills coaching between sessions.</description>
