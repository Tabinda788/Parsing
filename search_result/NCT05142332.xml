  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to increase COVID-19 and influenza vaccine acceptance and uptake&#xD;
      in vulnerable populations whose primary (and often only) health care access occurs in&#xD;
      emergency departments (ED Usual Source of Care Patients). Toward this goal we will conduct&#xD;
      one on one interviews and focus groups with ED Usual Source of Care Patients and community&#xD;
      partners and produce trusted messaging informational platforms (PROmotion of COvid-19&#xD;
      VA(X)ccination in the Emergency Department - PROCOVAXED) that will address barriers to&#xD;
      COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, especially vaccine hesitancy. We will then conduct a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized, controlled trial of PROCOVAXED platforms in six EDs to determine whether&#xD;
      their implementation is associated with greater COVID-19 and influenza vaccine acceptance and&#xD;
      uptake in ED Usual Source of Care Patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our preliminary work research at 15 ED sites across the US indicates that ED Usual Source of&#xD;
      Care patients have particular health care access barriers, needs, and perceptions about&#xD;
      vaccines (vaccine hesitancy) that require specific review beyond traditional (non-ED user)&#xD;
      community engagement techniques. To gain insight about messaging that effectively addresses&#xD;
      these barriers, needs, and perceptions, we will conduct one on one interviews and focus group&#xD;
      meetings with ED Usual Source of Care Patients and community partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At five safety net EDs (Zuckerberg San Francisco General, Thomas Jefferson University&#xD;
      Hospital [Philadelphia], Methodist Hospital [Philadelphia], Harborview Medical Center&#xD;
      [Seattle], and Duke University Medical Center [Durham, NC], we will conduct a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized, controlled trial of implementation of PROCOVAXED platforms, with COVID-19&#xD;
      and influenza vaccine acceptance rates on post-intervention ED surveys as the primary&#xD;
      outcomes. Hypothesis: Implementation of PROCOVAXED platforms in EDs will be associated with&#xD;
      increased acceptance of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in ED patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after subjects' index ED visit enrollment in our PROCOVAXED implementation trial we&#xD;
      will conduct electronic health record review and phone follow-up surveys to determine ED&#xD;
      patient uptake (receipt) of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Hypothesis: Implementation of&#xD;
      PROCOVAXED platforms in EDs will be associated with greater COVID-19 and influenza vaccine&#xD;
      uptake in ED patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a cluster-randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of implementation of our&#xD;
      PROCOVAXED platforms in 5 high-volume, safety net hospital EDs, testing two hypotheses that&#xD;
      implementation of PROCOVAXED platforms will be associated with increased acceptance and&#xD;
      uptake of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in ED USCARE patients.&#xD;
