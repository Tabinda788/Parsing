  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of irregular heart rhythm due to electrical signal&#xD;
      disturbances of the heart. It is a very common arrhythmia and the risk of developing AF&#xD;
      increases with age and with other risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and&#xD;
      underlying heart disease. The main complications of AF are heart failure and stroke. However,&#xD;
      studies have shown that restoration of normal rhythm does not reduce these complications.&#xD;
      Rather, these complications are mitigated by controlling the heart rate and using blood&#xD;
      thinners to prevent stroke. Symptoms secondary to AF can occur due to the irregular heart&#xD;
      rate and poor contraction in the atria, the top chambers of the heart. These symptoms include&#xD;
      shortness of breath, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and palpitations. Restoring sinus&#xD;
      rhythm can sometimes alleviate these symptoms. Given that studies to date have not shown a&#xD;
      difference in hard clinical endpoints between rate and rhythm control strategies, the&#xD;
      decision to proceed with rhythm control depends on the patient symptom burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhythm control strategies in patients with persistent AF include cardioversion back to sinus&#xD;
      rhythm with long-term recurrence prevention via anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) or catheter&#xD;
      ablation. However, many studies of these procedures omit a sham placebo control arm. No&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation procedural intervention has been compared to a sham procedure. The&#xD;
      cardioversion procedure can easily be compared to a &quot;sham&quot; alternative, as it is non-invasive&#xD;
      with an expected response within days-to-weeks. Thus, a cardioversion versus &quot;sham&quot;&#xD;
      cardioversion trial will allow us to truly assess the impact of a rhythm-control strategy on&#xD;
      QOL. It is hypothesized that cardioversion of atrial fibrillation leads to significant&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life (QOL) compared to sham cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the true QOL impact of sinus rhythm restoration in patients with persistent AF&#xD;
      is of significant importance in guiding strategies for the management of AF. Hence, by&#xD;
      evaluating what the true effect of cardioversion on QOL in this blinded study, we can better&#xD;
      understand the role of medical management and AF ablation in our patients and assess resource&#xD;
      allocation to these procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, sham-controlled trial. All recruited&#xD;
      patients will undergo a 4-week pre-cardioversion phase of medical optimization (including&#xD;
      anticoagulation assessment/initiation, initiation of Amiodarone at 200mg daily, and&#xD;
      rate-control medications targeting a resting heart rate of &lt;100 bpm). An activity monitor is&#xD;
      provided to patients to be worn during waking hours for nine days. A baseline echocardiogram&#xD;
      is also performed (if not available within previous 6 months) during this pre-cardioversion&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One day prior to the day of cardioversion, the patient will have a 12-lead ECG. If the&#xD;
      patient is in sinus rhythm (chemical cardioversion due to Amiodarone) they will be exited&#xD;
      from the study and referred back to their MRP cardiologist. If the patient is in AF, they&#xD;
      will be randomized electronically using web-based software (Dacima, Montreal, Canada) to&#xD;
      &quot;shock&quot; or &quot;sham shock&quot;. This will not be revealed to investigators and will be put in a&#xD;
      closed envelope and questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the day of the cardioversion procedure, following anaesthesia administration, the&#xD;
      unblinded team (non-MRP cardiologist / anesthesiologist will open the envelope indicating&#xD;
      which arm the patient has been randomized to. Other members of the team will step out of the&#xD;
      room. The unblinded non-MRP cardiologist will call out as per usual &quot;All clear&quot;, following&#xD;
      which a shock is delivered as per the Ottawa Cardioversion Protocol in the &quot;shock&quot; arm.&#xD;
      Otherwise, no shock is delivered in the &quot;sham shock&quot; arm. Following the intervention,&#xD;
      telemetry is discontinued by the unblinded team prior to patient restoration of&#xD;
      consciousness. The unblinded team in the day unit will refrain from providing the patient&#xD;
      with information regarding which arm they were randomized to. For the purpose of the patient&#xD;
      chart and related documentation, a standardized template will be provided to document the&#xD;
      process but not the actual intervention, as to maintain patient blinding. A patch Holter&#xD;
      monitor is to be applied and worn for rest of study (4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks post-cardioversion, a blinded healthcare professional will re-administer a&#xD;
      series of questionnaires. At the end of the trial (4 weeks), an ECG will be performed and the&#xD;
      patients will be unblinded and told their results. A follow-up (telephone or in-person) will&#xD;
      be undertaken at 6 weeks with the patients' MRP cardiologist for discussion of further&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The trial is a double blind (patient and physician blinded) at the time of cardioversion and during the four weeks of post intervention follow-up. The Informed Consent will clearly outline the importance of maintaining the blind to the patient. The &quot;blinded&quot; team will have no knowledge of treatment allocation. The &quot;blinded&quot; team will review the patient at all FUs and during any unscheduled hospital visits/admissions and will be point of contact for the patient's primary physician. This will include the MRP cardiologist and the study nurse / coordinator.</masking_description>

The ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer will capture movement across three axes (y-, x- and z-axis). Participants' sedentary time, and time spent in low, moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity, expressed as proportion of wear time (minutes/day or minutes/week) of activity.
