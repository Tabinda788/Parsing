    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nitazoxanide (NTZ) is safe and effective in&#xD;
      treating mild or moderate COVID-19 illness in adults and adolescents at highest risk for&#xD;
      severe outcomes. Each participant will be followed for approximately 28 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Oxygen saturation ≤ 93% on room air at sea level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompetent persons who have been fully vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2, defined as&#xD;

             two weeks prior to onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential who are either pregnant or sexually active without&#xD;
             the use of birth control.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to swallow oral tablets or capsules.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects likely or expected to require hospitalization unrelated to COVID-19 during&#xD;
             the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
