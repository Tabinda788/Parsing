  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double blind, controlled trial investigates changes in the cardiovascular&#xD;
      index (triacylglycerol/HDL-cholesterol × waist/hip ratio) after 12 weeks of marine protein&#xD;
      hydrolysate (MPH) or whey protein powder (placebo) supplementation in adult healthy persons.&#xD;
      Additionally, the study investigates potential effects on plasma parameters of metabolic&#xD;
      health including lipids, glucose, inflammatory parameters and redox state, as well as&#xD;
      associations between dietary MPH and body weight, abdominal obesity, body composition, and&#xD;
      gut microbiota composition. Finally, putative end-products of diet-microbial interactions&#xD;
      (TMAO and short-chain fatty acids) with CVD risk factors and biomarkers of mitochondrial&#xD;
      function are examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marine protein sources, including fish and fish protein hydrolysates, may have particular&#xD;
      health benefits. Health benefits from fish consumption have been attributed to the n-3&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic&#xD;
      acid (DHA). Proteins from marine sources may contain valuable bioactive components, with&#xD;
      amino acid composition and protein profiles that differ from terrestrial sources. Generally,&#xD;
      the dietary source of protein can affect cellular energy metabolism, and hydrolyzed peptides&#xD;
      can have potent and specific bioactive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rest raw materials (RRM) from cod (Fjordlaks AS, Norway) are used for the hydrolysis&#xD;
      production (Food Grade). Freshly minced RRM were treated with enzymes optimized to generate&#xD;
      bioactive hydrolysates using facilities and techniques approved for human consumption. The&#xD;
      investigational products are given in a dose of 18 g protein per day, corresponding to the&#xD;
      protein content of a standard meal, and similar to doses recommended in a range of protein&#xD;
      supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrolls around 70 men and women age of 20-80 years with waist circumference of &lt;&#xD;
      102 cm for men and &lt; 88 cm for women. Prospective study participants were informed of the&#xD;
      study and invited to participate through advertising primarily in social media (Facebook&#xD;
      advertisement, geographically limited to 12 km surrounding the city centers of Bergen and&#xD;
      Ålesund). Participants provided written informed consent, and were screened via&#xD;
      self-reporting in an online form in EasyTrial hosted by the Research Unit for Clinical Trials&#xD;
      at the University of Bergen. Data collection by the study staff at baseline verifies&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and participant eligibility prior to randomization. The&#xD;
      potential participants are informed about practical details at a digital or physical meeting&#xD;
      1-2 weeks prior to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups of participants (40-60% males/females) are block randomized to the two treatments&#xD;
      using randomly selected block sizes, and stratified according to sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are given a container with the powder sufficient for the entire study&#xD;
      period, and a spoon to measure the intake at breakfast (6 g), lunch (6 g) and supper (6 g),&#xD;
      or morning (9 g) and evening (9 g) according to individual preference. The patients will mix&#xD;
      the powder products in water or mineral water. Flavours have been masked by supplementation&#xD;
      with beet powder, and mixing 0.5 g fish hydrolysate per serving in the placebo, to minimize&#xD;
      differences in taste of the placebo and active product.&#xD;
