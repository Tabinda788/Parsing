      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractures of the medial epicondyle are a common pediatric injury, with an estimated annual&#xD;
      incidence of 40-60/100,000 per year. The typical mechanism is a fall onto an outstretched&#xD;
      hand, creating a valgus load at the elbow leading to avulsion of the epicondyle from pull of&#xD;
      either the flexor-pronator mass or ulnar collateral ligament. This injury is most frequent in&#xD;
      children between the ages of 9 and 14, and is 4 times more likely in boys. Medial epicondyle&#xD;
      fractures are associated with elbow dislocation in about 50% of cases, and ulnar nerve&#xD;
      dysfunction is reported to occur nearly 10% of the time. No standard of care for medial&#xD;
      epicondyle fractures exists, as similar outcomes have been demonstrated in observational&#xD;
      studies with both operative and nonoperative treatment. Historically, most treatment has been&#xD;
      nonsurgical, with immobilization of the injured elbow in a long-arm cast until healing.&#xD;
      Increasingly, however, these injuries are being treated with surgical intervention, which in&#xD;
      most cases consists of a single screw affixing the bony piece back to its donor site on the&#xD;
      humerus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective studies have previously been performed evaluating the treatment of medial&#xD;
      epicondyle fractures in children. All of the current literature on this issue has serious&#xD;
      methodological limitations, such as lack of appropriate controls, retrospective assembly of&#xD;
      cohorts, unstandardized assessment of outcomes, and irregular assessment of negative outcomes&#xD;
      and adverse events. A 2009 systematic review of the literature identified 14 studies in which&#xD;
      a comparison between operative and nonoperative treatment of medial epicondyle fractures in&#xD;
      children or adolescents was performed. Of these, all were retrospective and observational in&#xD;
      nature, with varying outcome measures utilized in the presentation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable debate among clinicians as to the optimal management of medial&#xD;
      epicondyle fractures, however, despite the lack of clear evidence of benefit, increasingly&#xD;
      these injuries are being managed operatively. Explanations for the trend toward surgery focus&#xD;
      on the athletic demands of children and adolescents, and the expectations of patients,&#xD;
      parents, and coaches of early mobilization and return to sport. Because of the ongoing&#xD;
      uncertainty as to best practice, a randomized trial is both ethical and indicated.&#xD;
      High-quality data is necessary to better inform the decision regarding surgery and ensure&#xD;
      both safe and effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY OVERSIGHT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety oversight will be under the direction of a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)&#xD;
      composed of individuals with the appropriate expertise and knowledge of pediatric orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgery usually obtained via an accredited pediatric orthopaedic fellowship. Members of the&#xD;
      DSMB should be independent from the study conduct and free of conflict of interest, or&#xD;
      measures should be in place to minimize perceived conflict of interest. The DSMB will meet at&#xD;
      least semiannually to assess safety data on each arm of the study. The DMSB will operate&#xD;
      under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at the&#xD;
      organizational meeting of the DSMB. At this time, each data element that the DSMB needs to&#xD;
      assess will be clearly defined. The DSMB will provide its input to NIAMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and&#xD;
      data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data&#xD;
      anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the&#xD;
      clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected,&#xD;
      documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Conference&#xD;
      on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements&#xD;
      (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source&#xD;
      data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and&#xD;
      inspection by local and regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the&#xD;
      supervision of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the&#xD;
      accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data and patient reported outcomes will be entered into REDCap, a 21 CFR Part&#xD;
      11-compliant data capture system provided by the DCRI. The data system includes password&#xD;
      protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that&#xD;
      appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from&#xD;
      the source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will employ a superiority framework. Specifically, the null hypothesis is that&#xD;
      there is no difference in PROMIS UE (CAT) at 1 year between arms. The alternative hypothesis&#xD;
      is that there is a difference between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were based on detecting a clinically meaningful difference in the&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper extremity computer&#xD;
      adaptive test (CAT) of 4 points. PROMIS measures use a T-score metric with a mean of 50 and&#xD;
      standard deviation of 10 in a reference population. A sample size of 133 per am, assuming a&#xD;
      two-sided type I error rate of 0.05, will provide 90% power to detect a difference between&#xD;
      arms of 4 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To account for 20% lost-to-follow-up or missing data on the primary outcome at 12 months, we&#xD;
      have inflated our sample size to 167 per arm, for a total target enrollment of 334.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded sample size re-estimation based on the standard deviation of the primary outcome,&#xD;
      after 50% of participants have completed the 6-month follow-up, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analyses will be based on an Intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. A per-protocol&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to assess the robustness of the ITT analysis. In the event of&#xD;
      minimal (&lt;5%) missing outcome data, primary analyses will be based on complete cases,&#xD;
      reflecting a modified intent-to-treat analysis (mITT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL APPROACH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will summarize all baseline variables by arm. Specifically, continuous&#xD;
      variables will be summarized using mean and standard deviation, for normally distributed&#xD;
      variables, and median and IQR, for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be summarized with frequency and percentages. There will be no formal hypothesis testing&#xD;
      for comparison of baseline characteristics between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analyses of the primary outcome at 1 year will be assessed with a two-sided type I&#xD;
      error rate of 0.05. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction will be applied to analyses of&#xD;
      all secondary outcomes to account for multiplicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis for the primary aim will utilize a mixed effect model for the primary outcome,&#xD;
      PROMIS Upper Extremity Function at 6 months, with a fixed effect for treatment arm and a&#xD;
      random effect for site. Fixed effects will also include variables considered in the&#xD;
      randomization (elbow dislocation status, age, sex) to control for imbalances in both the&#xD;
      design and analysis. Incorporation of a random center effect will allow for separation of&#xD;
      between site and within site variance components. Distributional assumptions will be&#xD;
      assessed, and transformations or inclusions of higher order terms may be considered, as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will employ similar methods for all secondary continuous outcomes.&#xD;
      Generalized linear mixed modeling approaches will be used for secondary binary and count&#xD;
      outcomes, with appropriate link and distributional assumptions. All models will incorporate a&#xD;
      random center effect and fixed effects for additional covariate considered in randomization,&#xD;
      as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses may also consider trajectories of the primary outcome measured over&#xD;
      time. Fixed effects for baseline PROMIS Upper Extremity Function, time, treatment arm, and&#xD;
      the interaction will be included in a linear mixed effect model with random patient nested in&#xD;
      center effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction will be applied to all secondary analyses to account&#xD;
      for multiplicity.&#xD;
