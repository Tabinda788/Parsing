  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out about the usefulness of mindfulness for&#xD;
      weight loss and improvement of physical and mental health in people who have non-alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adding mindfulness to lifestyle changes for weight loss may improve fatty liver disease in&#xD;
      particular and overall health and well-being in general by helping sustain weight loss and&#xD;
      maintain a healthy lifestyle. This study will allow researchers to learn more about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a condition where there is accumulation of excess fat in&#xD;
      the liver of people who drink little or no alcohol. It is part of the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by diabetes, or pre-diabetes (insulin resistance), being overweight or obese,&#xD;
      elevated blood lipids, as well as high blood pressure, all are risk factors for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will receive usual care, and in addition, they may be asked to&#xD;
      participate in a mindfulness-based stress reduction program for 8 weeks. Usual care involves&#xD;
      the routine clinic follow up visits and routine lab tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
