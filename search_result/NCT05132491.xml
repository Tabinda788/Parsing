  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to develop and evaluate the Technology Early Career&#xD;
      Preparation Intervention (TECH-Prep) program with African American high school students with&#xD;
      developmental disabilities. Developmental disabilities include conditions such as Autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorders, seizure disorders, behavior disorders, brain injury, cerebral palsy, Down&#xD;
      syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome/effects. This program is designed to increase technology&#xD;
      career interests, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, goal persistence, and increase entrance&#xD;
      into post-secondary education or work subsequent to high school completion of African&#xD;
      American youth with developmental disabilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's goal is to recruit 30 African American high school students with&#xD;
      developmental disabilities to participate in this TECH-Prep study each year for the next five&#xD;
      years (2019-2024). The TECH-Prep program integrates many empirically supported strategies&#xD;
      identified in the STEM education and the secondary transition research literature. The&#xD;
      program will incorporate overview of coding careers, reviewing video testimonials of&#xD;
      individuals working in technology fields, and reviewing/responding to training materials&#xD;
      intended to facilitate workplace social skills development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program will require participants complete three surveys to track their progress. To&#xD;
      receive incentives for completing program components, data on program component completion&#xD;
      will be tracked of participants in the treatment group. This involves tracking data on when a&#xD;
      participant completes review of the final segment of each learning module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for this study will consist of three surveys completed at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately after completion of the program, and six weeks after completion of the program.&#xD;

    <description>The Tech-Prep survey is a 90-item survey. Scores are calculated on sub-scales included in the survey. These subscales focus on Social Cognitive Career Theory concepts of outcome expectation, career readiness, and goal persistence. Change scores from baseline at post-training and post-internship will be evaluated. Higher scores indicate increased outcome expectations.</description>
