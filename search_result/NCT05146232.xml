  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and pneumoperitoneum in the reverse-Trendelenburg position during laparoscopic sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy (LSG) are reported to negatively affect cerebral oxygenation. Anesthetic agents&#xD;
      can have variable effects on the regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) measured&#xD;
      with near-infrared spectroscopy. This study investigated the potential impact of opioid free&#xD;
      versus opioid based anesthesia on rSO2 in LSG cases. 80 American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) II-III patients, 18-65 years of age, with a body mass index of &gt;35 kg/m2 , undergoing&#xD;
      LSG were randomized to two groups: opioid free and opioid based groups for anesthesia&#xD;
      maintenance. The rSO2 values were recorded preoperatively, 1 min after anesthesia induction,&#xD;
      and every 5 min during surgery. Arterial blood gases (ABG) were measured in the fifth minute&#xD;
      postinduction (t1), 30th minute postinsuflation (t2), and postextubation (t3), and&#xD;
      correlation with rSO2 .&#xD;

      All study participants wiere provided a written informed consent before enrollment. 80&#xD;
      patients in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class II-III,&#xD;
      18-65 years of age, with a BMI of &gt;35 kg/m2 who were planning to undergo an elective LSG were&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Patients with preexisting cerebrovascular diseases, overt neurological&#xD;
      signs, alcohol or psychoactive drug addiction, uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension,&#xD;
      advanced organ failure, preoperative peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;96%, or a&#xD;
      hemoglobin˂9g/dL were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization for the investigation, the patients were randomly assigned using opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes to two groups; Group (I) (n = 40): The Opioid based anesthesia: Pre-induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia a bolus of 2ug/kg/ IV Fentanyl (sunny pharmaceutical Egypt Company under&#xD;
      License of Hameln pharmaceutical Germany) was administered then infusion of 1 ug/kg/h was&#xD;
      given intraoperatively to maintain the change in hemodynamics within 20 % of the baseline ,&#xD;
      and Group (II) (n = 40): Opioid free anesthesia: Pre-induction of general anesthesia 1000 mg&#xD;
      paracetamol (Pharco B international pharmaceutical-Egypt) and dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg.&#xD;
      Lidocaine 1 mg/kg (Alexandria co. for pharmaceutical and chemical industries-Egypt), ketamine&#xD;
      0.5 mg/kg were given I V bolus dose. Then continuous infusion with lidocaine 2 mg/kg/hr and&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate (Manufactured by E.I.P.I.CO-. Egypt).1.5 g/hr was started. Local&#xD;
      infiltration of skin incision with 0.25% bupivacaine at the end of the operation (Sunny&#xD;
      pharmaceutical -Egypt) (n = 30). Randomization was performed according to a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization code, and a statement showing the patients' group was placed&#xD;
      in a sealed, numbered envelope according to the results. Each patient drew an envelope and&#xD;
      was enrolled in the study depending on the group written in the envelope. Randomization was&#xD;
      performed by a physician who was not involved in the monitoring of the patients. The&#xD;
      anesthesiologist caring for the patient was aware of the group assignments. The patients were&#xD;
      blinded to the group assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia protocol all patients was administered 300 mg of oral ranitidine the night before&#xD;
      the surgery and 10 mg IV metoclopramide in combination with 150 mg ranitidine 1 h before&#xD;
      arrival to the operating room. Upon the arrival to the operating room, an electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure, SpO2, rSO2 (Masimo oximeter), and neuromuscular monitoring&#xD;
      (TOF-Watch SX; Organon, Dublin, Ireland) were performed on the patients. Afterward,&#xD;
      preoxygenation was performed with 4 L/min oxygen (80%) for 3 min by using facemasks, and&#xD;
      anesthesia was induced with an IV propofol injection (1.5-2.5 mg/kg of ideal body weight) and&#xD;
      an IV bolus administration of remifentanil (1 lg/kg of lean body weight [LBW]) for 30-60 s,&#xD;
      and then switched to infusion at 0.25 lg/kg of LBW/min. After the eyelid reflex disappeared,&#xD;
      a neuromuscular blockade was performed using rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg of LBW) and tracheal&#xD;
      intubation was done. Volume-controlled mechanical ventilation was applied. Breathing gases&#xD;
      (oxygen, carbon dioxide and sevoflurane), the tidal volume were set as 7-8 mL/kg of LBW,&#xD;
      inspiratory:expiratory ratio as 1:2, positive end-expiratory pressure as 5-8 cmH2O, and the&#xD;
      respiratory rate was determined to obtain an end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure&#xD;
      (PETCO2) of 32-37 mmHg. These ventilator settings were not changed throughout the operation.&#xD;
      Oxygen/air (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] of 0.40), inspiratory fresh gas flow of 2&#xD;
      L/min), sevoflurane (1 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]), and remifentanil IV infusion&#xD;
      (0.1-0.25 lg/kg of LBW/min) were used in the for the maintenance of anesthesia. Neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade was performed during the operation by rocuronium infusion (0.3- 0.7 mg/kg of LBW/h).&#xD;
      IV normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution at 5-7 mL/kg of LBW was also used for&#xD;
      perioperative fluid maintenance. Nasopharyngeal temperature was monitored throughout the&#xD;
      surgery, and the patient temperature (36-37C) was ensured by using a forced-air warming&#xD;
      system for the maintenance of intraoperative normothermia during the procedure. After&#xD;
      anesthesia induction, a neutral head position of the patients was preserved to prevent&#xD;
      alteration of cerebral venous drainage. Carbon dioxide insufflation was performed with an&#xD;
      electronic laparoflator using a closed Veress needle technique, and intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      was automatically kept at the desired level (14-16 mmHg) during the surgery. After the&#xD;
      insufflation of carbon dioxide, the patients were positioned in a 30 reverse-Trendelenburg&#xD;
      and at a 10 right lateral position. At the end of the surgery, the blockade was reversed by&#xD;
      administering 4 mg/kg of adjusted body weight sugammadexwith a PTC of 1-2. All patients were&#xD;
      extubated when fully awake. The patients were referred to the recovery unit and monitored for&#xD;
      50 min for complications. In cases where no complications was apparent, the recovery was&#xD;
      evaluated using the modified Aldrete scoring system. Once the score was ≥9, the patients were&#xD;
      taken to the unit. For postoperative nausea and vomiting, 4-5 mg dexamethasone was used&#xD;
      (except for diabetic patients on insulin) 90 min before anesthesia induction and 4-8 mg IV&#xD;
      ondansetron 20-30 min before the end of the operation. For postoperative pain management, 1 g&#xD;
      IV acetaminophen was administered 20 min after induction and 30 mg IV ketorolac 20 min before&#xD;
      onset. Then, 1 g IV acetaminophen was administered every 6 h + 50 mg IV dexketoprofen every 8&#xD;
      h for the first 48 h. In addition, morphine was administered using a patient-controlled&#xD;
      analgesia delivery system (demand dose, 20 lg/kg of ideal body weight; lockout time, 6-10&#xD;
      min; 4 h limit, 80% of the total calculated dosage) for 48 h postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative measurements, physiological variables including heart rate (HR), MAP, SpO2,&#xD;
      and PETCO2 were recorded preoperatively, 1 min after the induction, and every 5 min until the&#xD;
      patient was referred to the recovery unit. The MAP and HR values were allowed to fluctuate up&#xD;
      to 20% of the preoperative values of the patients. For this purpose, the infusion rate of&#xD;
      remifentanil was accordingly increased and decreased. When hypotension (MAP ˂60 mmHg) or&#xD;
      bradycardia (HR˂45beats/min) continued for longer than 3 min, they were treated with 5 mg&#xD;
      ephedrine and 0.5 mg atropine, respectively. Patients who received ephedrine or atropine more&#xD;
      than twice were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral oxygen saturation. The rSO2 values of the patients were recorded preoperatively, 1&#xD;
      min after the induction, and every 5 min until the patient was referred to the recovery unit.&#xD;
      Measurements in the last 30 s of preoxygenation, performed for 3 min with 4 L/min oxygen&#xD;
      (80%) preinduction was accepted as preoperative values. To assess rSO2, cerebral oximetry&#xD;
      sensors were placed at least 2 cm above the left and right eyebrows and 3 cm from the midline&#xD;
      (to prevent the sagittal sinus from influencing the results) before the induction in&#xD;
      accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Before applying the sensor pads, the&#xD;
      forehead of the patient was cleaned with acetone alcohol and bandaged to protect the sensors&#xD;
      from ambient light and to keep them stable. Cerebral oxygen desaturation was defined as a&#xD;
      &gt;25% decrease in the rSO2 value compared with the preoperative value (decrease should be more&#xD;
      than 20% if the preoperative value was˂50) and maintenance of this situation for≥15s. In this&#xD;
      case, the following algorithm was used. First of all, normotension of the patient was ensured&#xD;
      (administration of vasopressors such as ephedrine, and/or infusion of isotonic fluids) and&#xD;
      the patient's neck were checked. Operating times. anesthesia, surgery, pneumoperitoneum, and&#xD;
      recovery times were recorded. Recovery time was defined as the time from discontinuation of&#xD;
      sevoflurane or propofol and remifentanil at the end of the surgery to the restoration of&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing, opening of the eyes upon a verbal command, squeezing of the hand of&#xD;
      the observer and extubation. Additionally, the complications (including nausea and vomiting)&#xD;
      developed by the patients were also recorded.&#xD;
