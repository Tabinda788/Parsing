  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients having percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) over a period of 9 years&#xD;
      at a large tertiary care center with available creatinine measurements both before and within&#xD;
      48 hours after the procedure were included; patients on chronic dialysis were excluded.&#xD;
      Patients treated between 2012 and 2017 comprised the derivation cohort (n=14,616) and those&#xD;
      treated from 2018 to 2020 formed the validation cohort (n=5,606). The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI, defined per Acute Kidney Injury Network&#xD;
      [AKIN]). In addition, independent predictors of CA-AKI will be derived from multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis. Model 1 will include only preprocedural variables, while Model&#xD;
      2 will also include procedural variables. A weighted integer score based on the effect&#xD;
      estimate of each independent variable will be used to calculate the final risk score for each&#xD;
      patient. Impact on 1-year mortality will be also evaluated.&#xD;

      Consecutive patients who underwent PCI at a tertiary hospital (Mount Sinai Hospital, New&#xD;
      York, NY, USA) between 2012 and 2020 with documented serum creatinine both pre- procedure and&#xD;
      within 48 hours after PCI were identified from our existing prospectively populated database.&#xD;
      Only patients who expired within 48 hours after PCI and with pre-existing end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease requiring dialysis were excluded from the present analysis. CA-AKI was defined&#xD;
      according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network as an increase by ≥50% or ≥0.3mg/dl within 48&#xD;
      hours after PCI compared to pre-PCI serum creatinine. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin plasma&#xD;
      level ≤13 g/dl for men and ≤12 g/dl for women. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as an&#xD;
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤60 ml/min/1.73 m2, per the Chronic Kidney&#xD;
      Disease-Epidemiologic (CKD-EPI) formula. A dedicated data coordinating center performed all&#xD;
      data management. Prespecified clinical and laboratory demographic information was obtained&#xD;
      from hospital charts that were reviewed by independent research personnel who were unaware of&#xD;
      the objectives of the study; accumulated data were then entered prospectively in the&#xD;
      database. Patients treated between 2012 and 2017 will comprise the derivation cohort&#xD;
      (n=14,616) and those treated from 2018 to 2020 will form the validation cohort (n=5,606).&#xD;
      Independent predictors of CA-AKI (defined per Acute Kidney Injury Network) will be derived&#xD;
      from multivariate logistic regression analysis. Model 1 will include only preprocedural&#xD;
      variables, while Model 2 will also include procedural variables. A weighted integer score&#xD;
      based on the effect estimate of each independent variable will be used to calculate the final&#xD;
      risk score for each patient. Impact on 1-year mortality of CA-AKI occurrence will be also&#xD;
      evaluated with Cox regression analysis. Multivariable Cox regression analysis will be also&#xD;
      performed to look for independent association of CA-AKI occurrence with mortality.&#xD;

    <description>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention is a catheter based technique widely used to restore coronary vessel patency. It is performed by fluoroscopic guidance and it requires the use of iodinated contrast medium. The use of iodinated contrast media has been historically linked to AKI occurring within days after their administration and typically referred to as CA-AKI. Furthermore, CA-AKI has been associated with long-term impairment of kidney function, need for renal replacement therapy, and subsequent all-cause mortality.</description>

        Patients with coronary artery disease have rather high prevalence of comorbidities&#xD;
        associated with increased risk of CA-AKI, and those undergoing PCI may also sustain acute&#xD;
        hemodynamic disturbances that further raise the risk of CA-AKI. All patients undergoing PCI&#xD;
        at the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, have been screened for inclusion in the present&#xD;
        analysis. No limits were set for age, sex and comorbidities (except for end-stage renal&#xD;
        disease requiring dyalisis).&#xD;
