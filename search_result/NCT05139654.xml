  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sport climbing has recently become a highly popular sport and was included in the Summer&#xD;
      Olympic Games 2021. Shoulder injury accounts for 15 to 20 percent of all sport climbing&#xD;
      injuries, and it is the third most common problems, only surpassed by wrist and hand&#xD;
      injuries. Sport climbing involves both open and closed chain movements of upper limbs. These&#xD;
      prolonged and repetitive movements on vertical or overhanging terrain may lead to overuse and&#xD;
      fatigue, which result in injuries. Sport climbing consists of multiple movement elements.&#xD;
      Pull up with small holds is a basic movement in sport climbing, and activates many shoulder&#xD;
      muscles, including trapezius, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi. Studies related to sport&#xD;
      climbing have focused on observing difference between sport climbers and non-sport climbers.&#xD;
      Altered posture, increased scapulohumeral rhythm during arm elevation, and decreased shoulder&#xD;
      angle during one-arm hanging have been observed in sport climbers. However, little studies&#xD;
      have investigated whether climbers with shoulder injuries demonstrate different shoulder&#xD;
      kinematics and muscle activation during tasks related to sport climbing. Therefore, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate the shoulder kinematics and muscle activation during&#xD;
      pull-up with small holds in sport climbers with and without shoulder pain. Methods. Thirty&#xD;
      sport climbers with shoulder pain and 30 healthy control subjects matched with gender, age,&#xD;
      dominant hand and experience will be recruited in this study. All subjects will undertake&#xD;
      physical examinations such as shoulder range of motion (ROM). Shoulder kinematics and muscle&#xD;
      activation will be collected during arm elevation in the scapular plane and pull-up with&#xD;
      gym-bar and 20mm depth small climbing holds. An electromagnetic tracking system will be used&#xD;
      to measure bilateral scapular and humerothoracic kinematics. Surface electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
      will be used to record muscle activation of bilateral upper trapezius, lower trapezius,&#xD;
      serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi. Demographic data and physical examination will be&#xD;
      analyzed by independent t test or Chi-square test. Two-way ANOVA will be used to test&#xD;
      differences between groups in kinematics and EMG data at different phases of tasks. If&#xD;
      significant interaction effect is found, Post-hoc pairwise comparison with Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction will be used. The significant level is set at 0.05.&#xD;
