  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T-1301 is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of multiple kinases being developed as an oral&#xD;
      drug for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. The nonclinical study results demonstrate&#xD;
      the nonclinical efficacy and safety of T-1301 and support the design of this Phase 1,&#xD;
      first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial in subjects with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label, multi-center, Phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of T-1301 capsules in subjects with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors (including lymphoma), and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled for the&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase. Actual number of patients will be determined by the number of dose&#xD;
      cohorts until the MTD is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-1301 will be administered orally QD or BID in a 28-day cycle (21 days on treatment followed&#xD;
      by 7 days off treatment) in sequential cohorts. Subjects can continue with the treatment&#xD;
      until one of the discontinuation criteria is met or until the planned stop of the study (12&#xD;
      months after the last subject receives the first dose of study drug), whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dose levels are: 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160 mg/day. The dosing&#xD;
      schedule will be once daily (QD) at the first dose level (10 mg/day) and be changed to twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) starting with the second dose level. Other dose levels or dosing frequency may be&#xD;
      explored based on safety and related drug exposure data following the decision of Safety&#xD;
      Review Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation will follow accelerated titration and the Bayesian optimal interval&#xD;
      (BOIN) design. During the initial accelerated titration phase, one (1) subject is enrolled&#xD;
      per dose level. In the subsequent phase when the BOIN design is used, subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in cohorts of size 3-6.&#xD;

    <description>The MTD will be selected based on isotonic regression as specified in Liu and Yuan (2015). Specifically, the dose for which the isotonic estimate of the toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate is selected as the MTD. If there are ties, the higher dose level is selected when the isotonic estimate is lower than the target toxicity rate and the lower dose level is selected when the isotonic estimate is greater than or equal to the target toxicity rate. The target toxicity rate for the MTD is 30% and the MTD will be determined based on the occurrence of the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessed using toxicity data during Cycle 1 (the first 28 days).</description>
