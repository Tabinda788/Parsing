  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments repeatedly coincide with&#xD;
      high-frequency hearing loss. This complaint is commonly exhibited in adults in middle/older&#xD;
      age who have a history of noise exposure. In this study, an immersive audiomotor training&#xD;
      game will be utilized to drive improvements in speech intelligibility, controlled by an&#xD;
      auditory memory training game. Physiological measures will be tracked that could inform&#xD;
      clinical assessment of hearing in noise abilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss is a chronic health disorder affecting approximately 15 percent of Americans.&#xD;
      High-frequency hearing loss can be imperceptible when listening in quiet environments.&#xD;
      However, in complex noisy environments, individuals can severely suffer from an inability to&#xD;
      resolve speech. This is despite having normal audiometric thresholds in the low-frequency&#xD;
      range within which speech signals are contained. There are several factors that could&#xD;
      contribute to speech intelligibility difficulties that are imperceptible with typical hearing&#xD;
      tests. These include impaired temporal encoding at the auditory nerve and the downstream&#xD;
      sequelae of peripheral damage in the central auditory pathway. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      assess how a set of physiological measures of auditory/neural processing map onto&#xD;
      suprathreshold hearing outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, significant improvements in speech intelligibility have resulted from&#xD;
      training on an immersive video game. The game uses a closed-loop audiomotor interface design&#xD;
      that reinforces sensory-guided feedback. As a control, an auditory memory training game has&#xD;
      been developed to replicate user expectations and procedural learning. In this study, an&#xD;
      audiomotor game and control game will be used as mechanisms through which to track changes to&#xD;
      physiological and perceptual biomarkers in a high frequency hearing loss cohort and a matched&#xD;
      normal hearing cohort. Tests will be run pre-training, post- training, and at a follow-up&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
