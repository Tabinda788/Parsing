    <textblock>
      Evaluation of double faced transverse preputial onlay island flap for hypospadias repair in&#xD;
      pediatrics. The preputial island flap, onlay technique has been popularized for hypospadias&#xD;
      repair as a result of offering a consistent combination of excellent cosmetic results and&#xD;
      acceptable complication rates. Like other techniques, urethrocutaneous fistulae continue to&#xD;
      be the most common complications, in addition to other complications and can be attributed to&#xD;
      the affection of flaps vascularity. Some authors describe a technique that resolves some of&#xD;
      these problems by combining the unique benefits of the double-faced preputial flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to evaluate double-faced preputial onlay island flap technique for&#xD;
      complication rate, outcomes for urinary stream, and cosmetic results.&#xD;

      Type of study: prospective RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different previous techniques for the repair of various levels of penile shaft&#xD;
           hypospadias with chordee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstration of two different well-established techniques for repair of anterior,&#xD;
           mid-penile, and posterior penile hypospadias without or with mild curvature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disadvantages of two-stage urethroplasty or technique as transverse inner preputial&#xD;
           onlay island flap that involves dissection of the flap from its dorsal preputial tissue&#xD;
           (as it affects the flap vascularity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Merits of single-stage urethroplasty double-faced preputial onlay island flap (as it&#xD;
           combines the benefits of vascularized pedicled flap, provides better functional and&#xD;
           cosmetic results, and low complication rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at pediatric surgery department at Al-Houssain and Sayed Galal&#xD;
      University Medical Centers, in the period from May 2019 to February 2021, on 68 male patients&#xD;
      with anterior, mid-penile, and posterior penile hypospadias without or with mild curvature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be investigated by routine laboratory tests for fitness for surgery. All of&#xD;
      them will undergo one-stage repair using either of 2 techniques of urethroplasty;&#xD;
      double-faced preputial onlay island flap versus transverse inner preputial onlay island flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be signed by the parents of all participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutes of the study: A multicenter study at pediatric surgery departments, Al-Azhar&#xD;
      University Medical Centers in Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of cases: Sixty-eight male patients. Time frame: 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be discussed and approved by the Ethics and Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      Committee at our hospitals. The procedures and the aim of the study will be clearly explained&#xD;
      to the patient and the family. Written informed consent will be obtained before enrollment of&#xD;
      the patients into the study. The family refusal to give consent for one-stage repair is&#xD;
      respected but does not deprive the patient from getting surgical care by two-stage repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to history taking, clinical examination, and necessary&#xD;
      laboratory investigations (CBC, Coagulation profile, Urinalysis). They will receive a dose of&#xD;
      single broad-spectrum antibiotic 30 min-1 hour before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly divided (using non-transparent closed envelope randomization&#xD;
      method) into two equal groups, each will include 34 patients; Group A will undergo&#xD;
      double-faced preputial onlay island flap and Group B will undergo transverse inner preputial&#xD;
      onlay island flap. All operations were done by the same surgical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: patients will be followed-up at OPDat 1, 3, 12, and 24 months, for incidence of&#xD;
      any complications. HOSE score questionnaire will be used for the evaluation of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented as mean, standard deviation, number &amp; percentage. For qualitative&#xD;
      data, Chi-square test (X2) is used to compare between the two groups and independent-samples&#xD;
      t-test of significance is used when comparing between two means. The significance level is&#xD;
      set at P &lt;0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed using statistical package for social&#xD;
      sciences (SPSS) version 23.0, IBM Corp, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will focus on one-stage repair for anterior, mid-penile, and posterior penile hypospadias&#xD;
      without or with mild penile curvature using double-faced preputial onlay island flap in&#xD;
      comparison to inner preputial onlay island flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained from this study will be compared between both group and with those&#xD;
      reported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, it will focus on results, complications, their management, and clinical evaluation by&#xD;
      Hypospadias Objective Scoring Evaluation (HOSE) questionnaire evaluation tool. At the end,&#xD;
      the investigators will conclude the reconstructive technique that gives the better results&#xD;
      and least morbidity.&#xD;
