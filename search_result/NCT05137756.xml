      The aim is to evaluate the correlation of quantified fibro-adipous infiltration of muscles,&#xD;
      using the MRI-based Mercuri score, with deficiencies, activity limitations and social&#xD;
      participation in patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) refers to a rare disease spectrum characterized by&#xD;
      the presence of joint contractures at birth in at least two different body areas. Causes are&#xD;
      multiple. Amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposes are the most frequent causes. Phenotypes&#xD;
      consist of muscle weakness and atrophy of variant severity and joint deformities. The impact&#xD;
      on mobility, activities or daily living and participation is variable (Dai et al, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mercuri et al. (Mercuri et al, 2002) have developed a semi-quantitative score to mesure&#xD;
      fibro-adipous muscle infiltration on muscle MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between fibro-adipous infiltration and muscular deficits have already been&#xD;
      studied in other neuromusclar diseases such as Pompe disease (Figueroa-Bonaparte et al, 2016)&#xD;
      or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Brogan et al, 2018). These studies revealed good correlation&#xD;
      between disease onset, muscle strength and the degree of muscle fibro-adipous infiltration,&#xD;
      calculated using the Mercuri score. The authors concluded that muscular MRI can be used to&#xD;
      follow the neuromuscular disease progression as it is correlated with muscle function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to these progressive diseases, AMC is a congenital non progressive condition. It is&#xD;
      therefore tempting to hypothesize that the muscular fibro-adipous infiltration in these&#xD;
      patients could be of prognostic value for future capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to evaluate the fibro-adipous muscle infiltration in a thoroughly phenotyped&#xD;
      cohort of adult patients with Amyoplasia and Distal Arthrogryposes using the Mercuri score,&#xD;
      based on muscular MRI, in order to evaluate the correlation with deficiencies, activity&#xD;
      limitations and social participation.&#xD;

    <measure>Mercuri Scores of upper limbs, lower limbs,and trunk evaluated on MRI T1</measure>
    <time_frame>during 5 day evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of muscle fat infiltration was assessed with at least 2 visible slices. We used the four-point scale proposed by Mercuri et al 2002. Each muscle was staged as follows: 1. Normal appearance, 2. Mild involvement. 3. Moderate involvement. 4. Severe involvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>muscle weakness</measure>
    <time_frame>during 5 day evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>muscular weakness was assessed by function (flexion, extension etc.) and not by each muscle, using the Medical Research Council scale (0-5) for muscle weakness. The grading was as follows: 0, no contraction; 1, flicker or trace of contraction; 2, active movement possible only with gravity eliminated; 3, active movement against gravity in the whole range of motion; 4, active movement against gravity and resistance; 5, quasi-normal strength.</description>

    <measure>6 minutes walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>during 5 day evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>Mobility was assessed by the 6MWT20, performed by individuals who were asked to walk as self-preferred speed in a straight line on the floor with sequences of 30 meters, with a half-turn at each end. In case of interruption (fatigue, pain, dyspnea), patients were allowed to rest, until they felt able to restart.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>reaching score</measure>
    <time_frame>during 5 day evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to reach some body targets with upper limbs was assessed by ad hoc test. Individuals sitting on a chair were instructed to successively touch their mouths, heads, necks, backs, opposite shoulders, ipsilateral shoulders, knees and feet, with both hands. Each successful touch scored two points if easily performed, and one point if performed with difficulty. The total score was calculated on both sides averaged and ranged from 0 to 16 points.</description>

The higher the score, the more independent the patient is in performing the task associated with that item</description>
