      This project will compare the effects of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation Stretching&#xD;
      and Stabilization of Upper Trapezius on Pain, Range of Motion and Functional Disability in&#xD;
      Mobile Phone User with mobile phone-induced Neck Pain. The population sample will be 50&#xD;
      divided randomly into two groups by concealed envelop method. Then I will collect data from&#xD;
      the social security hospital Physiotherapy department, Lahore. Group A was given stretching&#xD;
      exercises and Group B was given stabilization exercises (25 stretchings and 25stabilization).&#xD;
      NDI and NPRS were used as an outcome measure to quantify the upper trapezius on pain, range&#xD;
      of motion, and functional disability with non-specific neck pain.&#xD;

      NDI and NPRS were used as an outcome measure to quantify the upper trapezius on pain, range&#xD;
      of motion, and functional disability with non-specific neck pain. Single blinding of accessor&#xD;
      was done at the time of recording of outcome measures pre and post-treatment Baseline was 4th&#xD;
      week and 8th week. Eighty female participants and twenty male participants in each group. The&#xD;
      duration was 9 months. The 18-30 years age range of both males and females were considered.&#xD;
      There was not any statistically significant difference between the two groups as p &gt; 0.05.&#xD;
      But within-group changes show that there was a significant change in baseline, 4th week, and&#xD;
      8th-week readings for NDI, NPRS, and ROM with p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Pain will be measured by Numeric Pain rating scale. 000. NPRS is one of the ways to quantify pain and is a subjective measure in which individuals rate their pain on an eleven-point numerical scale. The scale is composed of 0 no pain to 10 worst imaginable pain. It has been shown that a composite scoring system including best, worse, and current level of pain. Pain by definition is an unpleasant sensation and emotional experience that is related to tissue damage</description>

    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a self-report questionnaire used to determine how neck pain affects a patient's daily life and to assess the self-rated disability of patients with neck pain.&#xD;
The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a self-report questionnaire used to determine how neck pain 0affects a patient's daily life and to assess the self-rated disability of patients with neck pain.We currently know that the NDI consists of one factor - &quot;physical disability&quot; - although NDI scores correlate well with SF-36 mental component scores as well Functional disability has been defined as acquired difficulty in performing basic everyday tasks or more complex tasks needed for independent living. The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a self-report questionnaire used to determine how neck pain affects a patient's daily life and to assess the self-rated disability of patients with neck pain</description>

    <description>Neck flexion pattern The therapist slightly pulled the chin so that it was lifted and causing the neck to extend. Commands such as &quot;pull your chin in&quot; and &quot;look at your left hip&quot; were given to the patient. Resistance was given against left rotation, flexion and lateral flexion along with the traction to the patient's chin.Neck extension pattern The therapists lightly pulled the chin so that the neck was flexed; head was rotated and tilted to the left. Commands such as &quot;lift your chin and then &quot;lift your head to look above were given to the patient. Passive resistance was provided against right rotation, extension and lateral flexion.</description>
