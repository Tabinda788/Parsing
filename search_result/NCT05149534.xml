  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent and represents a high healthcare burden&#xD;
      among Veterans. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain-based therapy&#xD;
      that may be effective for treating PTSD. The theorized mechanism of rTMS is enhancement of&#xD;
      emotional flexibility via the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex node of the brain's cognitive&#xD;
      control network. Given this mechanism of action, adding rTMS to an evidence-based&#xD;
      psychotherapy (EBP) for PTSD may enhance treatment effects. Written exposure therapy (WET) is&#xD;
      a brief EBP for PTSD found to reduce attrition compared to lengthier first line treatments.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will determine if active rTMS added to WET compared with&#xD;
      sham rTMS added to WET results in improved PTSD outcomes. The investigators will also&#xD;
      determine if emotional flexibility is a mechanism of symptom improvement. This work will&#xD;
      improve upon PTSD intervention and inform the mechanism of treatment effectiveness for&#xD;
      Veterans suffering from PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this CDA-2 proposal is to use repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) to augment effectiveness of written exposure therapy (WET), a&#xD;
      narrative-based trauma exposure paradigm, in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&#xD;
      and emotion dysregulation in Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF)&#xD;
      Veterans. As a clinical neuropsychologist with expertise in emotion regulation, Dr. Lantrip's&#xD;
      long-term goal is to improve upon and develop effective interventions for trauma-related&#xD;
      illness in Veterans by identifying and targeting behavioral and neural mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OEF/OIF Veterans have experienced increased length and number of deployments, contributing to&#xD;
      diagnosis of PTSD. rTMS is a brain-based therapy involving application of a repetitive, brief&#xD;
      magnetic pulse to the scalp through an electromagnetic coil. rTMS applied to the dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant depression, and&#xD;
      recent work has shown efficacy for treating PTSD. Standard rTMS treatments are stand-alone,&#xD;
      though the unique properties of rTMS may make it more effective when added to a psychotherapy&#xD;
      such as an evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP) for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS is theorized to act on the DLPFC node of the brain's cognitive control network (CCN) to&#xD;
      improve emotion regulatory processes and facilitate reduction in affective symptoms. In&#xD;
      support of this theory, studies have found that improvements in affective flexibility,&#xD;
      upregulation of positive affect, and downregulation of attention to negative stimuli occur in&#xD;
      task-based paradigms immediately following stimulation of the DLPFC with rTMS in a&#xD;
      single-session. In addition, recent research has found that rTMS prior to cognitive&#xD;
      processing therapy (CPT) in Veterans with PTSD is effective at improving PTSD outcomes&#xD;
      compared to sham rTMS plus CPT, possibly through the regulatory mechanism of the CCN. Given&#xD;
      these promising findings, further study into optimizing rTMS-augmented EBPs for PTSD is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are limitations to both rTMS and first line EBPs for PTSD. One problem is high numbers&#xD;
      of sessions needed for effective treatment (i.e. 20 sessions of rTMS and 12-18 sessions of&#xD;
      EBPs) contributing to high attrition rates. A large multi-site study of VA patients in PTSD&#xD;
      clinic found that just 2% of a sample of 1924 Veterans who had at least one session of EBP&#xD;
      received an &quot;adequate dose&quot; of at least 8 sessions.12 A potential optimization for&#xD;
      rTMS-augmented EBPs would be to reduce session number to improve retention. WET is a novel&#xD;
      EBP for PTSD that is non-inferior to CPT in as few as 5 sessions. Using rTMS to augment WET&#xD;
      in Veterans with PTSD is a crucial step in this line of inquiry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double-blind, Phase II randomized controlled trial will examine whether rTMS added to&#xD;
      WET results in superior outcomes compared to sham rTMS added to WET (N=98 with women and men&#xD;
      equally represented). The investigators will randomize 49 OEF/OIF Veterans with PTSD to&#xD;
      undergo an active rTMS/WET treatment protocol versus 49 OEF/OIF Veterans given a sham&#xD;
      rTMS/WET treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To compare PTSD outcomes of those who experience active rTMS/WET versus sham&#xD;
      rTMS/WET. Hypothesis 1: Active rTMS added to WET will contribute to greater PTSD symptom&#xD;
      reduction compared to sham rTMS added to WET in Veterans with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2a: If there is a treatment effect in Aim 1, determine if emotional flexibility&#xD;
      mediates the rTMS/WET-PTSD relation. Aim 2b (exploratory): Determine if emotional flexibility&#xD;
      has a unique mediating effect over cognitive flexibility. Hypothesis 2a: Significant&#xD;
      reduction in PTSD symptoms will be partially mediated by emotional flexibility. Hypothesis&#xD;
      2b: Significant reduction in PTSD symptoms will be partially mediated by cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility, but to a lesser extent than emotional flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This CDA-2 extends Dr. Lantrip's research integrating emotion regulation and neurostimulation&#xD;
      to understand and improve upon treatment of PTSD in Veterans. The CDA-2 will provide her with&#xD;
      specialized training in WET, a unique exposure-based therapy for the treatment of trauma, as&#xD;
      well as clinical trials for PTSD, and neurostimulation. The mentoring team integrates&#xD;
      expertise in the proposed areas of study and extensive experience mentoring early career&#xD;
      investigators. Project findings will inform a future VA Merit proposal, which will focus on&#xD;
      individual differences and mechanisms contributing to PTSD symptom improvement in&#xD;
      TMS-augmented behavioral therapy. This study has the potential to inform and improve upon&#xD;
      existing treatments for PTSD. Together, Dr. Lantrip's work aligns with VA's priorities,&#xD;
      CR&amp;D's mission, and with the goal to provide the highest quality of care for Veterans.&#xD;

    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) is a 30-item structured interview designed to make both a current and lifetime diagnosis of PTSD and to assess PTSD symptom severity over the last week or month. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM-5 cluster. Severity ratings are from 0 (absent) to 5 (extreme/incapacitating)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Male and female veterans of all races/ethnicities are eligible to be included in the study&#xD;
        if they meet all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  veteran;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English-speaking and able to provide written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diagnosed with PTSD;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  right-handed and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  between the ages of 18 and 50 years. Participants over age 50 will not be included, as&#xD;
             aging is known to impact brain structure, and thus the potential accuracy of the rTMS&#xD;
             target, independently of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with history of seizures or other serious neurological history including&#xD;
             acquired, developmental or degenerative neurologic illness, identified through medical&#xD;
             chart review, will be excluded due to potential lowered threshold for seizures during&#xD;
             rTMS stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of rTMS are unknown on fetal development, therefore, women who are&#xD;
             pregnant will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will also be screened and excluded if any of the following are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  current psychosis including psychotic disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  bipolar disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  schizophrenia; or another severe cognitive or psychiatric disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  positive screen for current suicidal intent and plan [with a score of 2 or 3 on&#xD;
                  BDI-2 item 9];&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  current substance use disorder; or substance use in the last 12 hours before the&#xD;
                  rTMS session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigators note that PTSD is often comorbid with traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
             in military veterans who were deployed to a war zone. The investigators will use the&#xD;
             Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs consensus-based classification of TBI&#xD;
             severity for classification of TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with moderate or severe TBI will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion will be enrolled.&#xD;
             This will enhance the ecological validity of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with cognitive impairment as evidenced by a Montreal Cognitive Screen&#xD;
             (MoCA) less than 23/30 or estimated baseline intellectual ability of a standard score&#xD;
             of less than 80 on a word reading test will be excluded due to potential&#xD;
             neurocognitive differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants on psychotropic medications will not be excluded, but participants will&#xD;
             be required to be stable on their medication for at least four weeks prior to&#xD;
             beginning the study and throughout the time of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants enrolled in long term, supportive psychotherapy (i.e. not an&#xD;
             evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP)) may continue to be involved in their treatment&#xD;
             throughout the study. However, participants involved in a concurrent EBPs will be&#xD;
             excluded. Participants will be asked to disclose whether they chose to participate in&#xD;
             an EBP during the course of the treatment or followup phases of the study.&#xD;
