  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label observational single-group clinical trial to study the efficacy of a&#xD;
      commercially available dietary supplement and its effect on common PMS and menstrual&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the dietary supplement marketed as &quot;Elix Cycle Balance&quot; will improve&#xD;
      subjective wellbeing in trial participants by alleviating common symptoms of PMS and&#xD;
      menstrual symptoms, such as cramps, bloating, and mood swings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 65 participants will be recruited for the trial following screening, with the&#xD;
      expectation that at least 50 participants will complete the trial. The trial will be fully&#xD;
      remote, a technology platform will be utilized to screen, enroll and capture study data of&#xD;
      the participants. The total intervention study period will be 3 months.&#xD;
