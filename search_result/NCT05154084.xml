  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Superficial bladder cancer, known as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), is the most&#xD;
      common type of bladder cancer. It is expensive to manage and significantly impacts on&#xD;
      patients' quality of life. This is because there is a high burden of recurrent disease after&#xD;
      initial treatment, and need for long term surveillance for recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important step in the diagnosis and treatment of NMIBC is the first surgical&#xD;
      procedure called the transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). There is evidence&#xD;
      that the quality of the TURBT operation, and the use of a single administration of bladder&#xD;
      chemotherapy following the operation, can reduce cancer recurrence rates and progression to&#xD;
      more invasive cancer. There is anecdotal evidence that the quality of TURBT surgery and the&#xD;
      usage of intravesical chemotherapy varies widely between hospitals and thus may result in&#xD;
      worse outcomes for some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if audit and feedback can improve the&#xD;
      quality of TURBT surgery and if this reduces recurrence of NMIBC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RESECT aims to be the largest multicentre international observational study evaluating the&#xD;
      first and most important step in the management of non muscle-invasive bladder cancer&#xD;
      (NMIBC), the transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that achieving a &quot;good quality&quot; TURBT results in reduced NMIBC recurrence rates.&#xD;
      This evidence forms the basis for the recommendations made in evidence-based guidelines such&#xD;
      as the European Association of Urology (EAU), the American Urological Association (AUA) and&#xD;
      the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The RESECT study will evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of a variety of patient, hospital, surgical and surgeon-related factors which may&#xD;
      contribute to altered outcome in patients with NMIBC following a TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only known national data collection about quality standards in TURBT surgery is in&#xD;
      Scotland. The aim is to conduct a multicentre international observational study of urological&#xD;
      practice for the management of NMIBC. Current operative practice will be measured across&#xD;
      hospitals, regions and countries and compare these against evidence-based recommendations. It&#xD;
      will be determined if any hospital, service, training or technical factors impact the&#xD;
      achievement of quality indicators and/or early recurrence rates. These data will be used to&#xD;
      present hospital and surgeon performance back to surgeons as an intervention to drive quality&#xD;
      improvement. The timing of feedback to different hospitals will be varied randomly so that it&#xD;
      can determined if the feedback is having an impact on audit performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESECT aims to answer some key UNKNOWNS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does reporting and comparing our TURBT quality make us do it better? What things should be&#xD;
      measured to determine TURBT quality? What rate of achievement should be aimed for in our&#xD;
      practice? What factors are associated with better achievement of TURBT quality?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The is an observational study that will include randomized feedback to hospitals about their&#xD;
      TURBT performance. Sites will be randomized to either receiving early feedback during the&#xD;
      study or to not receiving early feedback and just taking part in the study. Performance will&#xD;
      then be compared between hospitals that received feedback during the study and those who did&#xD;
      not.&#xD;
