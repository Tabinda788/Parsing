  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An Open-Label, Non-Randomized, uncontrolled, single-dose pilot study of VGB-R04 in subjects&#xD;
      with Hemophilia B.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia B is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by pathogenic variants (eg, mutations,&#xD;
      deletion) in the FIX gene. HB patients have frequent and potentially life-threatening&#xD;
      bleeding and often develop progressive physical disability and pain from chronic&#xD;
      haemarthropathy. Current replacement therapy needs regular treatment in the life-long time,&#xD;
      bringing heavy economic and social burdens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VGB-R04 is a novel AAV vector carrying a high specific activity factor IX variant. This study&#xD;
      is intended to evaluate the safety, tolerability and kinetics of a single IV infusion of&#xD;
      VGB-R04. All subjects in this study will provide informed consent and then undergo screening&#xD;
      assessments up to 6 weeks before administration of VGB-R04. All subjects will undergo 52(±2)&#xD;
      weeks of safety observation and will be encouraged to enroll in an extension study to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term safety of VGB-R04 for a total of five years.&#xD;
