  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III open label study designed to compare JDQ443 as monotherapy to docetaxel&#xD;
      in participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring a KRAS G12C&#xD;
      mutation who have been previously treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy and immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy either in sequence or in combination.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed as a Phase III trial and consists of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized part will evaluate the efficacy and safety of JDQ443 as monotherapy in&#xD;
           comparison with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extension part will be open after final progression-free survival (PFS) analysis (if the&#xD;
           primary endpoint has met statistical significance) to allow participants randomized to&#xD;
           docetaxel treatment to crossover to receive JDQ443 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include adult participants with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      (stage IIIB/IIIC or IV) KRAS G12C mutant non-small cell lung cancer (by tissue as determined&#xD;
      by a Novartis-designated central laboratory) who have received prior platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy and prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy administered either in sequence or&#xD;
      as combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 360 participants will be randomized to JDQ443 or docetaxel in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      stratified by prior line of therapy and geographic region.&#xD;

These include five domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact) and a global health status/HRQoL scale. The time to definitive 10-point deterioration is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of event, which is defined as at least 10 points absolute increase from baseline (worsening) of the corresponding scale score, with no later change below the threshold or death due to any cause</description>
