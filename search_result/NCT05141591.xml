  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be designed to investigate the impact of the preoperative anxiety level on&#xD;
      postoperative opioid requirement during the PACU stay, in order to improve postoperative pain&#xD;
      treatment in the long term after ENT surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study can contribute to improve postoperative pain management in patients in the&#xD;
      field of ENT surgery, as new influencing parameters and risk factors may be discovered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Due to the frequency of surgeries, acute postsurgical pain (APSP) is a common&#xD;
      clinical problem. In this study, the investigators will investigate pre-surgical&#xD;
      psychological factors associated with the experience of APSP in ENT surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed to investigate the impact of gender-specific preoperative anxiety&#xD;
      states, using the STOA, APAIS, PCS and VAS-A scoring systems, on postoperative opioid&#xD;
      consumption after elective ENT surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings may have important implications for developing more personalized strategies in&#xD;
      acute postoperative pain therapy in selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Study aim is to investigate the impact of the preoperative anxiety level, using the&#xD;
      validated STOA questionnaire, on postoperative opioid requirement during the PACU stay, in&#xD;
      order to improve postoperative pain treatment in the long term after ENT surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study can contribute to improve postoperative pain management in patients in the&#xD;
      field of ENT surgery, as new influencing parameters and risk factors may be discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a higher preoperative anxiety state, is a predictive&#xD;
      factor of opioid requirement in the early postoperative period after ENT surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Surgery-related psychological factors like anxiety state will be assessed&#xD;
      gender-specific, in patients scheduled for elective ENT surgery by validated questionnaires&#xD;
      (STOA, APAIS, PCS and VAS-A), filled out by the patient the day before surgery and on the day&#xD;
      of surgery, to investigate the correlation with the postoperative opioid consumption.&#xD;
