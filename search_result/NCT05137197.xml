      A randomized, controlled, prospective, multicenter, patient and rater blinded study with 2&#xD;
      arms: Treatment as Usual (TAU) and Predictix Guided Treatment (PGT). The study will compare&#xD;
      the rate of treatment response and remission among both groups; TAU vs PGT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 354 eligible patients. An interim analysis is planned after 240&#xD;
      evaluable subjects complete the 8-week's visit. According to the interim analysis plan, the&#xD;
      sample size may be increased to 522.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate in the study the subjects must be at least 18 years old and able to give a&#xD;
      written informed consent after an oral and written explanation of the study aims and methods.&#xD;
      The study sample will include female and male patients with major depression diagnosis&#xD;
      according to DSM-5 and MINI criteria. For the detailed assessment of clinical severity of&#xD;
      specific disorder and treatment effects, the following disorder-specific rating scales will&#xD;
      be used: Montgomery-Asberg's Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression&#xD;
      scale (CGI), , Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Patient's Global Impression (PGI).&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into either the Predictix Guided Treatment (PGT) group or the&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual (TAU) group. Randomization will be stratified based on the number of&#xD;
      previous treatment failures for the current MDD episode to ensure balance of the treatment&#xD;
      groups. Patients will be prospectively treated with approved antidepressant medication for a&#xD;
      period of 8 weeks (defined as a treatment cycle) during and after which they will be&#xD;
      assessed, and treatment success or failure will be determined. Maximum desired up-titration&#xD;
      should be reached by week 2. Concomitant treatments that are permitted include:&#xD;
      benzodiazepines for those who had no previous hypnotic treatment - Zolpidem 10 mg at night or&#xD;
      for anxiety -no more than 10 mg/day Diazepam or equivalent; formal psychotherapy not started&#xD;
      within a month before the beginning of the study; non-psychopharmacologic drugs with CNS&#xD;
      effects if the patient has been receiving a stable dose of the drug for at least one month&#xD;
      before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be defined as responders if the decrease in MADRS scores is at least 50%&#xD;
      compared to baseline. The remitters will be defined if the scores are less than 10 on the&#xD;
      MADRS. Patients who do not meet these criteria will be defined as non-responders and&#xD;
      non-remitters respectively. Following the 8 weeks, patients in the TAU group will be offered&#xD;
      PGT in an open-label extension of the study. Patients in the TAU and PGT groups will be&#xD;
      followed for up to an additional 2 treatment cycles (of up to 8 weeks each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment cycle will include 4 visits: Screening, Baseline (on site visit), 4 and 8 weeks&#xD;
      (Telephone visits). At least one completed cycle per patient is required for a patient to be&#xD;
      included in the analysis as study completed.&#xD;
