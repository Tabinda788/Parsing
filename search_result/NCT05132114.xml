  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      death in women worldwide. Pre-cancerous lesions (dysplasias) are detected by the&#xD;
      gynecologist's preventive smear test and can thus contribute to a 100% chance of cure if they&#xD;
      are clarified by a colposcopic examination as part of the dysplasia consultation and, if&#xD;
      necessary, surgically removed. Conization (= surgical removal of a cone of tissue from the&#xD;
      cervix) is the method of choice for removing the diseased tissue. LLETZ conization (Large&#xD;
      Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone) is the worldwide standard surgical procedure for&#xD;
      conization. There is risk of local persistence of the precancerous lesion if the cervical&#xD;
      dysplasia is not completely removed. To minimize this, the iodine test can be used. Here, a&#xD;
      5% iodine solution (so-called Lugol's solution) is dabbed onto the cervix uteri, resulting in&#xD;
      an intense and characteristic brown staining of the healthy cervical epithelium. Sites&#xD;
      without staining are termed iodine negative and may contain dysplastic cells. The strength of&#xD;
      iodine testing lies in its high specificity, i.e., the reliable ability to exclude&#xD;
      false-positive results. The purpose of intraoperative iodine staining is to select the&#xD;
      resection line with a high degree of certainty in healthy (i.e., iodine-positive) tissue in&#xD;
      order to reduce the rate of cervical dysplasia that is not completely removed (so-called&#xD;
      non-in-sano resection, or R1 resection). Systematic survey data from the dysplasia units&#xD;
      certified in Germany on the question of the use of intraoperative iodine testing in Germany&#xD;
      are lacking, as is the literature as a whole. For example, the current S3 guideline of the&#xD;
      German Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics on the diagnosis and treatment of cervical&#xD;
      dysplasia (as of March 2020) names intraoperative iodine testing only as a possible option&#xD;
      for performing LLETZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we want to answer the question under prospective-randomized conditions, whether&#xD;
      LLETZ performed with the help of an iodine test with selection of the resection line in the&#xD;
      iodine-positive area leads to a lower rate of R1 resections compared to the standard LLETZ&#xD;
      without iodine test.&#xD;

      1. Background 1.1. HPV and dysplasias of the cervix uteri Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are&#xD;
           the most common sexually transmitted pathogens worldwide. The prevalence in both male&#xD;
           and female populations is high. Epidemiological estimates suggest that 85-91% of&#xD;
           sexually active adults acquire at least one genital HPV infection by the age of 50, with&#xD;
           approximately 95% of HPV infections being spontaneously eliminated within 2 years in&#xD;
           terms of HPV immunological clearance. HPV preferentially infects the epithelial cells of&#xD;
           the anogenital area and, through incorporation of HPV DNA into the host genome of the&#xD;
           basal cells of the squamous epithelium of the cervix and subsequent expression of viral&#xD;
           components, causes dysplastic changes in the cervical epithelium that, if left&#xD;
           untreated, can develop into invasive carcinoma of the cervix (cervical carcinoma).&#xD;
           Cervical carcinoma is the fourth most common cancer as well as the fourth leading cause&#xD;
           of cancer-related death in women worldwide, responsible for 6.6% (570,000) of all new&#xD;
           cancer cases and 7.5% (311,000) of cancer-related deaths in women in 2018. The precursor&#xD;
           of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (approximately 80% of all cervical&#xD;
           cancers) is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which has three grades of&#xD;
           expression (CIN1, CIN 2, and CIN 3). Compared with invasive cervical carcinoma, the&#xD;
           incidence of precancerous lesions of the cervix uteri is much higher. It is estimated&#xD;
           that approximately 100,000 women in Germany develop high-grade dysplasia (CIN2/CIN3)&#xD;
           annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Surgical treatment If precancerous lesions with the potential to develop into an&#xD;
           invasive cervical tumor are detected, conization (= surgical removal of a cone of tissue&#xD;
           from the cervix) is the method of choice for removing the diseased tissue. Worldwide&#xD;
           standard as surgical procedure for conization is LLETZ-conization (Large Loop Excision&#xD;
           of the Transformation Zone). In addition to the risk of local persistence of the&#xD;
           precancerous lesion if the cervical dysplasia is incompletely removed, LLETZ also&#xD;
           increases the risk of preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy. This risk increases with&#xD;
           increasing volume of removed tissue. To reduce or avoid the aforementioned&#xD;
           complications, conization should be performed under colposcopic vision and as little&#xD;
           healthy cervical tissue as possible should be removed. One method of LLETZ that is as&#xD;
           tissue-conserving as possible is the intraoperative use of the so-called 'iodine test'.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. The iodine test For the identification of healthy squamous epithelium of the cervix&#xD;
           uteri, the so-called Schiller's iodine test can be used, which has been part of the&#xD;
           clinical routine in the context of colposcopy of cervical dysplasias for decades. In the&#xD;
           iodine test, a 5% iodine solution (so-called Lugol's solution) is dabbed onto the cervix&#xD;
           uteri, resulting in an intense and characteristic brown staining of the healthy cervical&#xD;
           epithelium. Sites without staining are termed iodine negative and may contain dysplastic&#xD;
           cells. The strength of iodine testing lies in its high specificity, i.e., the reliable&#xD;
           ability to exclude false-positive results. Not all iodine-negative areas contain CIN,&#xD;
           but iodine-positive areas are almost certainly healthy. In some centers, because of&#xD;
           these characteristics of the iodine sample, it is used during LLETZ to define the&#xD;
           resection line of LLETZ. The aim of this approach is to select the resection line with a&#xD;
           high degree of certainty in healthy (i.e., iodine-positive) tissue in order to reduce&#xD;
           the rate of cervical dysplasia that is not completely removed (so-called 'non-in-sano&#xD;
           resection' or 'R1 resection'). Systematic survey data from the dysplasia units certified&#xD;
           in Germany on the question of the use of intraoperative iodine testing in Germany are&#xD;
           lacking. The current S3 guideline of the German Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics on&#xD;
           the diagnosis and therapy of cervical dysplasia (as of March 2020) also refers to&#xD;
           intraoperative iodine testing as a possible option for performing LLETZ. However, exact&#xD;
           figures from controlled studies on the usefulness of iodine test-guided LLETZ are&#xD;
           lacking in the literature (PubMed search on 10/15/2021; search terms: cervical&#xD;
           dysplasia, colposcopy, Lugol's test, iodine test, Lugol's staining; LLETZ; LEEP;&#xD;
           conization). At our certified dysplasia center, it is the decision of the respective&#xD;
           surgeon whether an additional intraoperative iodine test is performed or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim of the study The aim of our study is to answer the question under prospective&#xD;
           randomized conditions whether LLETZ performed with the aid of iodine assay with&#xD;
           selection of the resection line in the iodine-positive region leads to a lower rate of&#xD;
           R1 resections compared with standard LLETZ without iodine assay.&#xD;
