  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1b study evaluates the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, and effects on cytokine and acute phase reactants of SP16, an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drug, in patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study will enroll up to 20&#xD;
      patients and each eligible patient will be randomized to receive either one of two doses of&#xD;
      SP16 (6 mg or 12 mg) or placebo by subcutaneous injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with excessive inflammation and cytokine storm that can&#xD;
      result in lung damage and potentially severe disease. SP16 is an anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      homeostatic drug that rebalances innate immune responses potentially resulting in mitigation&#xD;
      of inflammation and lung damage without immunosuppressive effects. SP16's mechanism of action&#xD;
      is through targeting LRP1, a receptor that regulates a variety of physiological processes&#xD;
      that contribute to inflammation and tissue injury, particularly in the lung. The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability, and effects on&#xD;
      inflammation of SP16 administered subcutaneously at a dose of 6 mg (0.1 mg/kg) or 12 mg (0.2&#xD;
      mg/kg). SP16 has previously been well tolerated in both healthy individuals and heart attack&#xD;
      patients at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. The study will also evaluate improvements in clinical&#xD;
      parameters such as patients requiring ventilation, improvement in blood oxygen levels (as&#xD;
      defined by both SpO2 &gt; 95% and respiratory rate ≤ 20/minute) and duration of hospitalization&#xD;
      or time spent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;
