&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of ITP FIRTECH on participant disability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of ITP FIRTECH on the degree of participant mobility&#xD;
&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) responders at Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>NRS is used to assess pain intensity. Responder is defined as participant with ≥30% decrease from baseline in pain NRS and who did not take rescue medication</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants reported with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants reported with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Normalized Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (PID) over 5 days (SPID0-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>PID equals the NRS change from baseline. A negative difference indicates improvement. Time-weighted summed pain intensity difference (SPID) was calculated by multiplying the PID score at each postdose time point by the duration since the preceding time point and then summing these values.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage change in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score over 5 days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered disability measure in which greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers on a 24-point scale, with 1 point per question.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mobility evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mobility from baseline to Day 5 based on descriptive analysis using Schober's test or Fingertip-to-Floor test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to reach acceptable pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Time to reach acceptable pain based on a NRS of 0 from baseline to Day 5</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to reach no pain</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time course of pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief is assessed using a verbal rating scale, where 0 = none and 4 = complete in response to a pain relief question</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Normalized sum of pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Summed pain relief score (TOTPAR) calculated by multiplying the pain relief score at each postdose time point by the duration since the preceding time point and then summing these values. Higher scores indicate more pain relief.</description>
