  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacy school is a 3-to-4 year intensive program that demands a high level of performance&#xD;
      from enrolled students. The fast-paced and challenging curriculum causes stress levels to&#xD;
      rise in students. The increase in stress can negatively affect performance in the classroom,&#xD;
      as well as affect relationships outside the classroom setting. While some level of stress may&#xD;
      be beneficial, the substantial amount of stress experienced by pharmacy students may also&#xD;
      negatively impact their quality of life. This proposed study aims to explore the effect a&#xD;
      convenient intervention on perceived stress, mindfulness, well-being, and resilience as&#xD;
      reported by second-year student pharmacists. Headspace will be used as the main study&#xD;
      intervention. This product is a mobile device application (aka, an app) that teaches users&#xD;
      how to meditate through guided exercises. It contains a library of different meditation&#xD;
      exercises the user can access from their smartphone or tablet at their own convenience. It is&#xD;
      our hope that the use of Headspace will enhance the students' ability to practice&#xD;
      mindfulness, which will allow them to better cope with stress in school and in future&#xD;
      practice. This could translate into improved learning and overall well-being.&#xD;

      This research study aims to implement a mindfulness meditation routine delivered via the&#xD;
      smartphone application Headspace to decrease perceived stress and improve well-being,&#xD;
      resilience, and mindfulness in second-year student pharmacists. This product is a mobile&#xD;
      device application (aka, an app) that teaches users how to meditate through guided exercises.&#xD;
      It contains a library of different meditation exercises the user can access from their&#xD;
      smartphone or tablet at their own convenience. The use of a smartphone application will allow&#xD;
      for convenience to promote adherence with the intervention among participants. The guided&#xD;
      meditation sessions will teach participants how to live in the present moment and handle&#xD;
      stressful situations that may arise in the future. As a result of this program the&#xD;
      investigators expect to see an inverse relationship between mindfulness meditation and&#xD;
      perceived stress and direct relationships between mindfulness meditation and well-being and&#xD;
      resilience. By learning to incorporate mindfulness meditation into their lives, participating&#xD;
      student pharmacists may be able to develop useful tools and effectively combat overwhelming&#xD;
      situations they may face in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two phases. Participating student pharmacists will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups. In Phase 1, Group A will complete four (4) weeks of&#xD;
      guided meditation while Group B does not use the application for meditation. Changes in study&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared from baseline to the end of the initial intervention period. In&#xD;
      Phase 2, Group B will be complete the guided meditation intervention. Group A will continue&#xD;
      their usual daily habits. It is possible for some students from Group A may continue to use&#xD;
      Headspace or another similar product to continue to incorporate meditation or mindfulness&#xD;
      into their daily routine. At the end of Phase 2, the changes in study outcomes will be&#xD;
      examined in Group B surrounding their use of the intervention. Outcomes will also be assessed&#xD;
      in Group A at the end of Phase 2 to examine whether there are sustained changes in study&#xD;
      outcomes and continued usage of meditation or mindfulness practices. All participating&#xD;
      student pharmacists will also be invited to participate in one of several focus groups&#xD;
      sessions to discuss experiences with the use of the guided meditation application.&#xD;

    <description>The change in perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale four (4)-item measure (PSS-4; Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983) will be compared between groups. This will be compared using an intent to treat approach and a per protocol approach (defined as those who were at least 80% adherent to the use of the mindfulness app). The PSS-4 yields a total score from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating more stress.</description>

    <description>The change in self-reported mindfulness as measured by the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire fifteen (15)-item measure (FFMQ-15; Baer, Smith, Lykins, et al., 2008) will be compared between groups. This will be compared using an intent to treat approach and a per protocol approach (defined as those who were at least 80% adherent to the use of the mindfulness app). Based on recommendations by Gu, Strauss, Crane, et al (2016), only four factors will be analyzed for change: describing, acting with awareness, non-judging, non-reactivity. Scores are derived by taking the mean response from all items and separately for each domain. Mean scores range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating higher levels of mindfulness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the meditation app (participant questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire was developed for this study to measure participants' opinions of the acceptability of the meditation app used. This will be administered at the end of the respective intervention period for each group (Phase 1 for Group A and Phase 2 for Group B). The questionnaire includes items on the value meditation, ease of use, and ability to incorporate the intervention into their daily schedule. Higher scores indicate more positive responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continued use of meditation (participant questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire was developed for this study to measure intended use of meditation in the future. Using the theory of planned behavior as a guiding theoretical framework, the questionnaire for future use included items on intentions to practice mindfulness or meditation in the next academic quarter, attitudes towards use of mindfulness or meditation practices, subjective norms surrounding engaging in mindfulness or meditation practices, and perceived behavioral control to engage in mindfulness or meditation practices. All items are scored such that higher scores represent more positive attitudes or opinions in each area.This questionnaire will be administered at the end of the each group's respective intervention period. Higher scores indicate more positive responses.</description>
