      The purpose of this study is to calculate the unnecessary costs that are associated with a&#xD;
      negative IBS diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Örebro Region there are 29 public general health centers. Approximately 300.000&#xD;
      inhabitants are listed within these health centers. Approximately 150 doctors are currently&#xD;
      working within the primary health care of Örebro Region. The electronic patient register in&#xD;
      Örebro Region allows to search for the International Statistical Classification of Diseases&#xD;
      (ICD-10) for IBS (K58.9 and K58.0) This allows retrospective research regarding diagnosis of&#xD;
      IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study planned ahead of this study by the same research group will focus on adherence to&#xD;
      guidelines of making a positive diagnosis of IBS. This data will be used for this study as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected retrospectively over the period 2013-2017 using the the electronic&#xD;
      patient register in Örebro Region. Patients diagnosed with IBS will be identified by ICD-code&#xD;
      K.58. By evaluating their patient register it will be determined how the GP has made the IBS&#xD;
      diagnosis. Patients will fall into three categories: those who received a positive IBS&#xD;
      diagnosis using the Rome criteria, those who received a negative IBS diagnosis and those&#xD;
      whose patient record is lacking sufficient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed analysis of the collected data will focus on the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      received a negative diagnosis. We will only include patients with age &gt;40 years without &quot;red&#xD;
      flags&quot;, since in these patients additional diagnostics are seldom warranted and generally not&#xD;
      useful. Red flags are, for example, blood in the stool, fever, anemia or involuntary weight&#xD;
      loss. In patients over 40 years, certain additional diagnostics may be important. For&#xD;
      example, changes in bowel habits may be caused by colorectal cancer and for this reason these&#xD;
      patients are routinely referred for a colonoscopy according to the guidelines for the&#xD;
      &quot;standardized care chain&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, data regarding the used diagnostic tools will be collected and at the end&#xD;
      the costs of these diagnostic tools will be calculated. If a patient is referred to a&#xD;
      specialist, the costs for the associated diagnostics will be calculated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the diagnostic tests will be evaluated as well, in order to confirm that these&#xD;
      tests were not indicated, as one may expect. If a patient was referred to a specialist, the&#xD;
      costs for the associated diagnostics will be calculated as well. Diagnostic tools include&#xD;
      gastroscopy, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, vaginal ultrasound, abdominal x-ray and&#xD;
      abdominal MRI. Laboratory testing includes liver tests, tests for lactose intolerance, stool&#xD;
      samples, food allergy tests and autoimmune serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups (positive vs negative diagnosis) will be compared regarding the costs of&#xD;
      diagnostic tools and laboratory testing, in order to establish the total amount of costs that&#xD;
      are associated with making a negative IBS diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical analysis of the economic costs for IBS patients receiving a positive&#xD;
      diagnosis will be compared to those receiving a negative diagnosis. The total cost of all&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures will be analyzed, as well as various cost components. A separate&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to confirm the expected negative results of the additional&#xD;
      diagnostic tests, associated with a negative IBS diagnosis.&#xD;
