  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, First-in-Human study in healthy participants, performed at a single study&#xD;
      center, consisting of 2 parts: Part 1 is a single ascending dose (SAD) study and Part 2 is a&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1: This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study consisting of 2 parts.&#xD;
      Part 1: SAD and Part 2: MAD. Part 1 consist of two parts: 1a and 1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1a will be a sequential SAD design. Each cohort (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive AZD5055 or placebo. There will a screening period of a maximum of 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1b will evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on the safety, tolerability, and PK of a&#xD;
      single oral dose of AZD5055. In Part 1b, there will a screening period of a maximum of 6&#xD;
      weeks (as in Part 1a) only for participants who have not previously participated in a Part 1a&#xD;
      cohort. A washout period of at least 4 days after IMP administration in Part 1a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part 1: Depending on the evaluation of data from the preceding cohorts, up to 2&#xD;
      additional cohorts/dose levels may be added at the discretion of the Safety Review Committee&#xD;
      (SRC). For Part 2: Depending on the evaluation of data from the preceding cohorts, up to 1&#xD;
      additional cohort may be added or expanded at the discretion of the SRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: This will be a 14-day, MAD design. Participants will be naïve, ie, will not have&#xD;
      participated in Part 1 of this study. Three different dose levels of AZD5055 are planned to&#xD;
      be investigated in 3 cohorts. In each cohort (1, 2 and 3) subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive AZD5055 or placebo.&#xD;
