  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novo Nordisk are doing this study to see if semaglutide tablets can be used as a treatment to&#xD;
      help people living with overweight or obesity lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at the change in participants' body weight. Participants will either get&#xD;
      semaglutide tablets (new medicine) or placebo tablets ('dummy' medicine that looks like&#xD;
      semaglutide but has no effect on the body). For a fair comparison, people are divided into&#xD;
      two groups at random by a computer. This process is called randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semaglutide tablets are new medicine being tested to treat overweight and obesity. Doctors in&#xD;
      many countries can already prescribe semaglutide tablets at lower doses to treat type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get semaglutide or placebo tablets for 68 weeks and will need to take 1&#xD;
      tablet every morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to taking the medicine, participants will have talks with study staff about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  healthy food choices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how to be more physically active&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what participants can do to lose weight The study will last for about 1Â½ year.&#xD;
           Participants will have 14 clinic visits and 7 phone calls with the study healthcare&#xD;
           professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken at 12 visits. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding&#xD;
      or planning to get pregnant during the study period. If participants are a woman and are able&#xD;
      to become pregnant, participants will be checked for pregnancy via urine tests.&#xD;
