  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase 2 study on the impact of acupuncture on acute dysphagia in&#xD;
      patients treated with radio-chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to attempt to reduce the impact of adverse effects produced by oncological&#xD;
      treatments, cancer patients frequently turn to complementary integrative therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among them, acupuncture has been characterized by a growing role in cancer-related symptoms&#xD;
      management in last 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After FDA approval for use as a medical device in 1996, the application of this technique in&#xD;
      oncology has been on the rise in the Western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By modulating brain regions involved in cognition and emotion, some degree of successful&#xD;
      symptom management with acupuncture has been demonstrated in oncology In the context of head&#xD;
      and neck cancer, the first application of acupuncture was related to chronic shoulder pain&#xD;
      and dysfunction following neck dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the effect of acupuncture and standard&#xD;
      treatment on swallowing function assessed with MDADI scale (MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory)&#xD;
      2 weeks after the end of RT (end of treatment, EoT).&#xD;
