    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if ceftriaxone administered postoperatively via&#xD;
      intravenous injection reduces postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and&#xD;
      narcotic consumption in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy for a cartilage or meniscal&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic surgery for cartilage and meniscus injuries are some of the most common&#xD;
      orthopaedic procedures currently performed. Post-surgical pain is initiated through an&#xD;
      inflammatory response to surgery. The pain response leads to sleep disruption and a further&#xD;
      increase in pain and additional sleep disruption. Opioid medications are often used after&#xD;
      surgery to treat pain despite the side effect profile. These medications also contribute to&#xD;
      poor sleep quality and duration. Early pain and narcotic use can be controlled by mitigating&#xD;
      the effects of post-surgical inflammation. Ceftriaxone is a readily available antibiotic and&#xD;
      is may have the desirable anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, but without the side&#xD;
      effects caused by other medications. Since it is highly selective in its inhibition,&#xD;
      ceftriaxone is an excellent candidate for reducing immediate post-operative pain and&#xD;
      heightened inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By doing this study, we hope to learn about the anti-inflammatory effectiveness of the&#xD;
      anti-biotic ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone has been shown to inhibit a key enzyme in the&#xD;
      post-operative inflammatory process and has been safely used for treatment of infections for&#xD;
      years. We would like to gather information about whether ceftriaxone helps reduce pain and&#xD;
      inflammation after surgery. Participation in this research will last about 2 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After providing informed consent, patients undergoing arthroscopy of the knee for meniscal or cartilage injuries will be randomized into one of two groups. At the time of surgery, while the patient is under anesthesia, one group will receive a single intravenous dose of 1 gram of ceftriaxone and the other will receive a single intravenous dose of 1% lidocaine in saline.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative narcotic use</measure>
    <time_frame>5-12 days post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative narcotic use will be monitored with self-reported medication consumption at the first post-operative visit, which will take place 5-12 days post-operative. The milligrams of morphine equivalent (MME) will be calculated based on patient responses with greater MME indicative of increased postoperative use of narcotic pain medications.</description>

    <ipd_description>With the participant's approval and as approved by local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), de-identified biological samples will be stored at the University of Kentucky Orthopedic Biomarker Repository. These samples could be used to research the causes of osteoarthritis after cartilage or meniscus injury, its complications and other conditions for which individuals with cartilage or meniscus injuries are at increased risk, and to improve treatment.&#xD;
Before sharing biomarker samples, we will ensure that the participant has given previous consent to the sharing of the information or samples. When we confirm that the previously provided consent is still in effect we will remove identifiers such as (e.g., name, medical record number, or date of birth). We will use a secure electronic log to track information shared without releasing the individual participant's identity.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Access to individual participant data will be available 1 year after the final study follow-up has been completed, and will be available until 5 years after the final study follow-up has been completed.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>The researchers requesting access to participant information or samples must complete a questionnaire describing why they need information or samples for their research and how they will use the information or samples. The researchers who receive the information or samples will sign an agreement to use the data responsibly.</ipd_access_criteria>
