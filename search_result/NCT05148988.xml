  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular disease with a high&#xD;
      mortality in case of rupture. The underlying processes initiating aneurysmal degeneration and&#xD;
      driving aneurysmal growth remain poorly understood. Local hemodynamics might play a key role&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of AAA, as it is associated with aneurysmal growth, intraluminal thrombus&#xD;
      formation and rupture risk. Visualizing and quantifying local blood flow profiles could&#xD;
      eventually provide more insight in the underlying mechanisms of aneurysm progression as well&#xD;
      as identify smaller AAA with increased vulnerability or larger AAA with low risk of rupture.&#xD;
      Consequently, this may improve risk assessment and provide patient-specific therapy guidance.&#xD;
      Nowadays, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the preferred treatment modality in most&#xD;
      patients with an infrarenal AAA. However, EVAR is associated with a relatively high&#xD;
      reintervention rate. It is hypothesized that the placement of a stent graft may alter local&#xD;
      hemodynamics and subsequent recirculations or flow stagnations promote the onset of&#xD;
      thrombosis or micro-emboli. These unfavourable flow conditions might be related to various&#xD;
      complications after EVAR, such as limb occlusion, renal dysfunction, and the persistence of&#xD;
      type II endoleaks. Visualizing local blood flow profiles after EVAR might provide insight in&#xD;
      these (un)favourable conditions. In vivo blood flow quantification is a great challenge,&#xD;
      particularly in the abdomen. Advanced ultrasound based techniques, incorporating ultrasound&#xD;
      contrast agents and plane wave imaging, proved to be feasible in quantifying aortoiliac blood&#xD;
      flow patterns in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of ultrafast&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound particle image velocimetry (echoPIV) measurements to quantify&#xD;
      spatiotemporal blood flow velocity profiles in the abdominal aorta of AAA patients before and&#xD;
      after endovascular repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine the correlation between echoPIV and phase-contrast MRI&#xD;
      (PC MRI) based measurements to ultimately validate the spatiotemporal velocity profiles&#xD;
      obtained with echoPIV. Furthermore, changes in blood flow velocity profiles after placement&#xD;
      of a stent graft will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative assessment vector velocity fields</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (endovascular repair)</time_frame>
    <description>Vector velocity fields derived from the echoPIV data will be used to calculate and visualize the velocity profile. In order to answer the question regarding feasibility of echoPIV the quality of the vector velocity fields will be assessed using three different metrics of which the first one is a qualitative assessment by different observers. Recordings of the contrast-enhanced ultrasound with an overlay of the vector velocity profiles will be reviewed on different topics following a scoring rubrics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contrast-to-background ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (endovascular repair)</time_frame>
    <description>The contrast-to-background ratio (CBR) is the second metric to assess the outcomes of the echoPIV measurements. The CBR is a quantitative measure for the contrast levels and therefore for the quality of the contrast-enhanced US image. The higher the CBR level (in dB) the higher the intensity of the contrast which is needed for sufficient PIV analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vector correlation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (endovascular repair)</time_frame>
    <description>The vector correlation is the third metric to assess the outcomes of the echoPIV measurements. The vector correlation demonstrates the tracking performance of the PIV algorithm. The vector correlation provides a unitless value between 0 and 1 in which 0 indicates poor tracking of the microbubble contrast and 1 indicates perfect tracking of the microbubble contrast.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation echoPIV and 4D flow MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (endovascular repair)</time_frame>
    <description>EchoPIV derived local hemodynamics will be compared to outcomes of the 4D flow MRI scan.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Influence of stent-graft placement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (endovascular repair)</time_frame>
    <description>EchoPIV derived local hemodynamics prior to- and after placement of the stent-graft will be compared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vorticity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (endovascular repair)</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple blood flow parameters will be derived from the echoPIV data. The first one is the vorticity, or the curl of the velocity. The vorticity represents the rotation of particles inside the flow field. This measure can potentially be used to define regions with disturbed blood flow, as a high value (in rad/s) indicates the occurence of a recirculation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vector complexity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks after the procedure (endovascular repair)</time_frame>
    <description>The second blood flow parameters derived from the echoPIV data is the vector complexity. Vector complexity is a measure of multi-directional flow, ranging from 0 till 1. a value of 1 means complex flow with all velocity vectors pointing in all directions, whereas a value of 0 means laminar flow with all velocity vectors pointing in the same direction. This measure can potentially be used to indicate regions with disturbed blood flow.</description>
