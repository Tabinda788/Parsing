  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial across 14 community pharmacies to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of the Brief Intervention-Medication Therapy Management intervention (BI-MTM). The&#xD;
      establishment of the BI-MTM model will result in a major impact for addressing the opioid&#xD;
      epidemic, preventing opioid use disorder and overdose, and safeguarding patient health in a&#xD;
      novel community-based service setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study examines a community pharmacy-based intervention to reduce opioid medication&#xD;
      misuse. Despite a recent national decline in opioid prescribing, 10.3 million Americans in&#xD;
      2018 reported misusing a prescribed opioid, and within this population, &gt;36% of those who&#xD;
      misused obtained the opioid medication by filling a prescription. The point of medication&#xD;
      dispensing, namely, the community pharmacy, is an untapped resource to address prescription&#xD;
      opioid misuse-especially when considering the &gt;60,000 pharmacies employing &gt;170,000&#xD;
      pharmacists in the US. This study aims to conduct a fully-powered RCT of the BI-MTM&#xD;
      intervention in community pharmacy settings that will accomplish 3 Specific Aims. The first&#xD;
      Aim will demonstrate the pharmacist-led BI-MTM intervention is superior to standard&#xD;
      medication counseling (SMC) for mitigating opioid medication misuse. This will be&#xD;
      accomplished by conducting a powered single-blinded randomized trial to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      BI-MTM (n=175) vs. SMC (n=175). Participants will be screened/recruited for eligibility at&#xD;
      point of dispensing in 14 community pharmacies in Utah, a high opioid prescribing and&#xD;
      opioid-adverse event state. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 2, and 6 months for&#xD;
      opioid medication misuse. Participant-level state prescription drug monitoring data will also&#xD;
      be linked with patient outcomes to assess objective changes in medication misuse behaviors&#xD;
      (e.g., early refills and doctor/pharmacy shopping). The second Aim will identify the pathway&#xD;
      by which BI-MTM results in improvements for depression, pain, and subsequently opioid misuse.&#xD;
      To accomplish this, a path analysis will assess relationships of BI-MTM: (1) on depression,&#xD;
      pain, and misuse, (2) depression on misuse, and (3) pain on misuse. The final Aim will&#xD;
      explore latent transitions of baseline to post-intervention misuse classes by intervention&#xD;
      group. This will be accomplished by using mixture modeling, specifically multi-group latent&#xD;
      transition analysis. The observed misuse indicators will be used to estimate latent class&#xD;
      transitions across time, grouping by treatment condition and adjusting for baseline&#xD;
      covariates. Completing SA1- 3 advance the understanding of BI-MTM efficacy and set the stage&#xD;
      for a national multisite trial.&#xD;

    <description>Brief Intervention Medication Therapy Management (BI-MTM) is the overarching model made up of 4 evidence-based components: Medication Therapy Management (MTM); Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT); naloxone dispensing, and Patient Navigation (PN). Each component is sequentially delivered within the model and addresses a critical aspect of opioid medication misuse and risk. The pharmacy-based portion of BI-MTM (MTM+SBIRT+naloxone) will be delivered by a PharmD level pharmacist, and PN will be delivered by a bachelor's level interventionist.</description>

    <description>Standard of Care is the treatment as usual condition, which follows federal and Utah state pharmacy requirements for pharmacists where in patients filling prescriptions receive information and opt-in counseling. Specifically, SMC in Utah requires pharmacists to: (1) offer counseling, (2) document counseling has been offered, (3) offer a counseling process for patients not present, and (4) discuss generic substitution.The duration of SMC in the current study is a single 5-10 minute session delivered by a University of Utah pharmacist other than the study pharmacist that possesses a similar level of education and professional licensing.</description>

    <intervention_name>Patient Navigation</intervention_name>
    <description>PN involves 8 weekly telephonic sessions lasting 30-45 minutes (telephonic to support lower-costs/sustainability). In session 1, the navigator reviews with the participant a report of scores from the baseline assessment to understand the participant's current health needs/challenges; session 1 also involves development of therapeutic alliance/rapport and goal setting. Sessions 2-4 focus on goal setting and identifying barriers and problem resolutions. The navigator elicits motivation and discusses this in context of readiness to change heath behavior and self-management skills. Sessions 2-4 also involve navigators supporting/assisting patients to fill out paperwork and enroll in needed social services and/or mental/behavioral/physical healthcare, including but not limited to primary care. Sessions 5-7 focus on encouraging and reinforcing treatment adherence, review-ing and identifying other care needs, and offering linkages to service providers as applicable</description>
