  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis is that treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor Ertugliflozin induces a&#xD;
      differential regulation in interstitial fluid vs plasma volume, with more reduction of the&#xD;
      volume from the interstitial fluid than from the circulating plasma volume, which results in&#xD;
      Ertugliflozin inducing more potent congestion relief with minimal impact on blood volume and&#xD;
      organ perfusion. Ertugliflozin reduces the levels of sodium and water from the skin and the&#xD;
      interstitial tissue (which improves tissue congestion).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The glucosaminoglycan (GAG) network in the subcutaneous interstitium can non-osmotically bind&#xD;
      large amounts of sodium. Therefore, the GAG network creates a hypertonic sodium concentration&#xD;
      without fluid accumulation. This means that the subcutaneous GAG act as a third compartment&#xD;
      that is able to non-osmotically store sodium without inducing congestion, thus serving as&#xD;
      buffer in the case of sodium overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that the SGLT2 inhibitor Ertugliflozin enhances the functionality&#xD;
      of the subcutaneous GAG network. The hypothesis is that Ertugliflozin-induced GAG&#xD;
      functionality induces more potent congestion relief (reduction in sodium and water content in&#xD;
      the interstitial tissue) with minimal impact on blood volume and organ perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will perform a randomized clinical trial with a cross-over design. Patients&#xD;
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) will be randomized to the SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitor Ertuglifozin or to placebo. Skin punch biopsy will be performed before treatment&#xD;
      and after treatment (one month) to evaluate skin content of water and sodium. At each time&#xD;
      point, an oral salt challenge will be performed to investigate the functionality of the GAG&#xD;
      network, and whether Ertugliflozin mitigates the degree of tissue and vascular congestion&#xD;
      after this oral salt challenge as compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor Ertugliflozin induces a&#xD;
      differential regulation in interstitial fluid vs plasma volume, with more reduction of the&#xD;
      volume from the interstitial fluid than from the circulating plasma volume, which results in&#xD;
      Ertugliflozin inducing more potent congestion relief with minimal impact on blood volume and&#xD;
      organ perfusion. Ertugliflozin reduces the levels of sodium and water from the skin and the&#xD;
      interstitial tissue (which improves tissue congestion). This overarching hypothesis causes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. in the baseline situation, chronic treatment with Ertugliflozin:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. will reduce skin/tissue congestion as demonstrated by lower skin water content and&#xD;
           lower volume of interstitial-extracellular fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. will reduce skin sodium content due to a mobilization of sodium from the&#xD;
           subcutaneous glucosaminoglycan (GAG) network&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. will create a differential regulation of interstitial vs plasmatic volume, with&#xD;
           ertugliflozin decreasing tissue congestion (B-lines and dielectric resistance in lungs)&#xD;
           better than placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4. will only cause a mild reduction in plasma volume with no neurohormonal activation&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5. will ameliorate GAG structure: higher GAG levels, higher sulfated (functional) GAG,&#xD;
           less expression of enzymes degrading GAG, less GAG degradation products in plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. after an oral salt challenge (sodium overload), previous chronic treatment with&#xD;
           Ertugliflozin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. will improve the sodium buffering capacity of the skin GAG network, meaning&#xD;
      ertugliflozin will enhance non-osmotic sodium storage in the skin without causing tissue&#xD;
      congestion (edema) or vascular congestion (increase in plasma volume and filling pressures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. will reduce skin/tissue congestion (as mentioned in 2.1): lower skin water content and&#xD;
      interstitial-extracellular fluid volume&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. will not cause vascular congestion, will not raise plasma volume or LV filling pressures&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, Ertugliflozin will protect HFrEF patients from acute decompensations induced by&#xD;
      dietary transgressions by enhancing the skin sodium buffering capacity&#xD;
