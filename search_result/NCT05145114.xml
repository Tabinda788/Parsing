      Introduction: Prematurity refers to babies born before 37 weeks of gestation that through&#xD;
      technological advances survival is increasing, since most of them are referred to the&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Hemodynamic monitoring is of fundamental importance in&#xD;
      the care provided to critically ill patients and mechanical ventilation (MV) is often used&#xD;
      for the recovery and maintenance of newborns, especially premature infants with any pathology&#xD;
      that causes cardiorespiratory failure. Considering this, it is necessary to look for ways to&#xD;
      treat these newborns (NB), being the therapeutic positioning one of the simplest and most&#xD;
      fundamental to reduce the consequences of the mechanical advantages of the respiratory system&#xD;
      of newborns. Objective: To evaluate the hemodynamic repercussions in the various therapeutic&#xD;
      positions in premature newborns under invasive mechanical ventilation. Method: A field study&#xD;
      to be conducted will be randomized on an experimental, quantitative and descriptive&#xD;
      character. It will be developed at the Santa Casa de Misericórdia do Pará Foundation&#xD;
      (FSCMPa), in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The population to be evaluated will be preterm&#xD;
      infants with gestational age ≤37 weeks, on invasive mechanical ventilation, with no&#xD;
      congenital malformations, with the diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage and that those&#xD;
      responsible, after being informed, authorized to participate in the research. Being excluded&#xD;
      the preterm infants without legal companion, who are affected by any unfavorable clinical&#xD;
      condition, which makes the change of unfeasible position, children with neuromuscular&#xD;
      diseases, tracheostomized. A sample will be randomly selected in groups: Prono Group (GP),&#xD;
      Supine Group (GS) and Lateral Decubitus Group (GDL). The decubitus to be adopted for each&#xD;
      research subject will then be registered by the researcher in a specific form, recording as&#xD;
      respiratory cardiological responses: respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SPO2), temperature (T) and pressure blood pressure (BP). Such clinical&#xD;
      responses will be noted prior to NB positioning, then positioned according to the group to&#xD;
      which they will belong for 30 minutes, and then there will be another selection of vital&#xD;
      signs.&#xD;

      The present field study to be carried out will be controlled clinical trial, randomized,&#xD;
      experimental, quantitative and analytical. The research will be carried out in accordance&#xD;
      with the ethical aspects recommended in the Declaration of Helsinki and Nuremberg Code, and&#xD;
      by the research standards that may involve human beings of the National Health Council.&#xD;
      Parents and guardians of premature newborns eligible for the survey will be invited to&#xD;
      consent to the participation of newborns in the survey, in which the purpose, objectives and&#xD;
      procedures of the research will be explained, requesting the signature of the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form and Informed and the Informed Consent Term.Then, access to data related to the&#xD;
      newborn's medical record will be performed through the presentation of the Data Use&#xD;
      Commitment Term. The sample will be randomly separated into groups: Prone Group, Supine Group&#xD;
      and Lateral Decubitus Group. The decubitus to be adopted for each research subject will then&#xD;
      be registered by the researcher in a specific form that will contain the following&#xD;
      information: identification, gender, Apgar in the first and fifth minutes, GA, weight, use of&#xD;
      surfactant and amount of doses, time of use of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital&#xD;
      stay and others, with this information being obtained from the newborn's medical record, this&#xD;
      step will provide data that will characterize the sample. For data acquisition via medical&#xD;
      records, the researcher will submit the consent form for data use. The most used&#xD;
      physiological parameters are vital signs, such as heart rate and percutaneous oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, as they are the most easily observed responses. The most used physiological&#xD;
      parameters are vital signs, such as heart rate and percutaneous oxygen saturation, as they&#xD;
      are the most easily observed responses. This is due to the fact that babies who need&#xD;
      intensive care are usually under these assessments constantly by pulse oximeters and because&#xD;
      they have been the best scientifically validated among the physiological responses. The vital&#xD;
      signs of heart rate (HR), often respiratory rate (RR) and blood pressure (BP), can be&#xD;
      influenced by the infant 's age and health condition. Peripheral oxygen saturation may have&#xD;
      its results altered by the baby's behavioral state and pulmonary conditions. The assessment&#xD;
      of HR and RR, indirectly, may reflect respiratory discomfort, it is common to observe&#xD;
      tachypnea and some patients present tachycardia for not accepting or tolerating the&#xD;
      positioning they are submitted. To record the monitoring of cardiorespiratory physiological&#xD;
      responses, an interval of 2 hours after the diet will be respected so that there are no&#xD;
      complications during the procedure. The respiratory rate (RR) will be collected for this, the&#xD;
      thoracic incursions of the patients will be observed for one minute, counted on a digital&#xD;
      clock, and to measure the heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation, a pulse oximeter&#xD;
      will be used, provided by the institution , positioned on the newborn's foot. Axillary&#xD;
      temperature will also be measured with a thermometer specific to each NB and blood pressure&#xD;
      with a device from the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such clinical responses will be noted before the positioning of the NB, then participants&#xD;
      will be positioned according to the group they belong to for 30 minutes, and then there will&#xD;
      be a new verification of vital signs. During the time they are positioned, the RN will be&#xD;
      asked not to receive routine procedures from the NICU or any stimulation by the health team.&#xD;
      Only in cases that require urgent intervention. Being evaluated 1 times a day in the morning&#xD;
      shift for two weeks. The collected data will be stored in Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets ,&#xD;
      which will serve to perform a simple descriptive statistics that will be presented in&#xD;
      percentages, arranged in graphs and tables. Statistical analysis will be based on the use of&#xD;
      statistical tests that best fit the study proposal through the Biostat ® statistical package&#xD;
      . In order to know the profile of the data, the Shapiro-Wilk test will be applied to verify&#xD;
      whether the data under analysis presented normality. To compare the mean values of the data,&#xD;
      the ANOVA test will be performed, followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test for&#xD;
      the variables: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and the Studen t test for the&#xD;
      variables: blood pressure and axillary temperature. In all tests, the level for rejecting the&#xD;
      null hypothesis will be set at 5% (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
