  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the promising data emanating from trials investigating the effectiveness of advanced&#xD;
      hybrid closed loop (AHCL) insulin delivery systems in managing glycaemia in those with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (T1D), we currently know little about their efficacy in optimising glycaemia when&#xD;
      physical activity is factored into the equation. With the introduction of new AHCL systems&#xD;
      that have novel technological features, we are left with important questions of how to&#xD;
      optimise their use around physical exercise to not only minimise dysglycaemia, but also&#xD;
      encourage individuals with T1D to lead a physically active lifestyle for the associated wider&#xD;
      health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a three-period, randomised, cross-over study with a single-hormone (insulin)&#xD;
      AHCL system that compares the efficacy of three insulin management strategies: (i)&#xD;
      unannounced exercise and a full dose of meal-time insulin 90-minutes prior to commencement,&#xD;
      (ii) a 25% reduced dose of meal-time insulin with exercise announcement 90-minutes prior to&#xD;
      commencement and (iii) a 25% dose reduction in meal-time insulin with exercise announcement&#xD;
      45-minutes prior to commencement, in optimising TIR around dynamic physical exercise in&#xD;
      adults with T1D.&#xD;

      Following successful completion of a screening visit, participants will attend the laboratory&#xD;
      to complete 3 experimental visits during which they will undertake a 45-minute bout of&#xD;
      moderate intensity continuous exercise on a bicycle ergometer at ~60% VȮ2max. Prior to&#xD;
      commencing exercise, participants will consume a standardised low-glycaemic index,&#xD;
      carbohydrate-based meal (equating to 0.75g.CHO.kg.bm-1) with, or without, a 25% reduction in&#xD;
      their meal-time insulin dose as well as with, or without exercise announcement (according to&#xD;
      the randomisation). Exercise announcement will increase the individualised target glucose&#xD;
      levels to 8.3 mmol.L-1. Venous blood glucose sampling will be taken in 15-minute intervals&#xD;
      leading into and after exercise with 5-minute intervals performed during exercise. Samples&#xD;
      will be used to retrospectively cross-compare trial day glycaemic responses between visits.&#xD;
      Each participant will undertake 1 screening and 3 experimental visits equating to a total of&#xD;
      80 study visits&#xD;
