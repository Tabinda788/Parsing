  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out the safety and tolerability of combining the drug&#xD;
      evolucumab with standard immunotherapy in people with advanced lung cancer (a type called&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab (Opdivo™) and ipilimumab (Yervoy™) are immunotherapy-type drugs which are approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of advanced lung cancer that has expression of PD-L1 greater than or equal&#xD;
      to 1%. Evolucumab is being combined with nivolumab and ipilimumab to see if it will improve&#xD;
      the anti-tumor capabilities of the immunotherapy. Adding evolocumab to the combination of&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab has not been tested in people before and is considered&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;

             cardiac failure not controlled by medications. Patients with CAD recently treated with&#xD;
