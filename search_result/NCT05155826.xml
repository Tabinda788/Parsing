  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The labor induction concerns 22% of births in France. In the event of labor induction, in&#xD;
      almost two thirds of cases, a cervical ripening method is used and the use of mechanical&#xD;
      methods is observed for 8% of cervical ripening. Intra-cervical balloon placement is&#xD;
      generally well tolerated but is frequently associated with pain and acute anxiety. There are&#xD;
      few options for pain relief. Virtual reality, a relatively new intervention, has been studied&#xD;
      as a distraction technique for pain relief, but never in the context of the induction of&#xD;
      childbirth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's prospective single-center, randomized, single-blind, prospective study (1:1, 2 group&#xD;
      randomization) comparing a group of patients who benefited from the use of the virtual&#xD;
      reality headset to a group of patients who received standard care during balloon insertion.&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be formed: a &quot;standard care&quot; group and a &quot;standard care + virtual&#xD;
      reality&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at the Saint-Etienne University Hospital Center in the&#xD;
      gynecology-obstetrics department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of a virtual reality&#xD;
      helmet on the reduction of pain during the insertion of an intra-cervical balloon for&#xD;
      childbirth induction versus the use of standard care.&#xD;
