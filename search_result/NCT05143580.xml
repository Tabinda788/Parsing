    <textblock>
      This research is designed for experimental quantitative research and is conducted by simple&#xD;
      random sampling. Both the control group and the experimental group provided preoperative&#xD;
      routine nursing treatment and preoperative medical teaching manuals. The latter adds&#xD;
      cognitive therapy and gamification evaluation. Both groups used CAM-ICU to assess the&#xD;
      occurrence and duration of postoperative delirium, and DRS-R-98 was used to assess the&#xD;
      severity of delirium. After collection, use SPSS 22.0 statistical software package for&#xD;
      analysis and processing. The expected result is that the incidence of delirium, the duration&#xD;
      of delirium, and the severity of delirium in the experimental group were significantly lower&#xD;
      than those in the control group.&#xD;

      This study is an experimental quantitative research design. Both the control group and the&#xD;
      experimental group provide routine nursing treatment and preoperative medical teaching&#xD;
      manuals before surgery. The latter adds cognitive therapy and gamification evaluation of&#xD;
      &quot;Postoperative Care and Environmental Image Data Explanation&quot;. The two groups used CAM-ICU to&#xD;
      assess the occurrence and duration of delirium after surgery, and DRS-R-98 was used to assess&#xD;
      the severity of delirium. From 2021 to 2022, a simple random sampling method is adopted for&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the intensive care unit of a medical center in Central&#xD;
      Taiwan, and a lottery is drawn on the first day of each month to determine the belong to&#xD;
      which group in the current month. There were 55 persons in each group, and all subjects had&#xD;
      no cognitive impairment. After the collected, it was analyzed and processed with SPSS 22.0&#xD;
      statistical package software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The incidence of delirium, the duration of delirium, and the severity of&#xD;
      delirium in the experimental group were significantly lower than the control group.&#xD;

    <time_frame>After surgery, the patient was evaluated at 48 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>First use the Richmond Restlessness and Sedation Scale (RASS) to assess the state of consciousness. RASS is a 10-point scale. +1 to +4 represent different levels of anxiety, 0 points represent alertness and calmness, and -1 to -5 represent different levels of sedation.&#xD;
When the RASS score is between -3 and +4, then evaluate the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). The CAM-ICU is a four-step assessment method with items on altered mental status or fluctuating course, inattention, and altered level of consciousness or disorganized thinking.&#xD;
If the evaluation result is the following two combinations, the first combination is mental state change, inattention, and consciousness level change; the second combination is mental state change, inattention, and disorganized thinking. This means that the CAM-ICU is positive and delirium has occurred.</description>

    <measure>Duration of delirium</measure>

    <measure>Severity of delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>When delirium occurs, assessment is conducted at 9 am every day until the end of delirium, an average of one month.</time_frame>
    <description>When delirium occurs, use Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) to score the severity of delirium symptoms.&#xD;
DRS-R-98 has a total of 16 scoring items, including 13 delirium severity and 3 diagnosis items. The total score is up to 46 points, of which the highest severity is 39 points. The higher the score, the more serious.&#xD;
Clinically, the total score ≥ 18 points or the severity score ≥ 15 points are used.</description>
