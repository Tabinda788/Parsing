      The purpose of this study is to develop and examine the preliminary effects of an information&#xD;
      system for facilitating dementia case management in the home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the second phase of the project. The first year is the development stage of the&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to develop and examine the preliminary effects of an information&#xD;
      system for facilitating dementia case management in the home setting. In the previous&#xD;
      research (phase I), a mixed method was used to explore the content of case management and&#xD;
      assess the needs of the information system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the second phase of the project. The first year is the development stage of the&#xD;
      information system. Based on the data collected in the previous research (phase I), the&#xD;
      content and method of dementia case management will be established by the Delphi method, and&#xD;
      then the dementia case management information system will be constructed accordingly. In the&#xD;
      second year, the investigators will conduct a pilot study to examine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      case management information system.&#xD;

    <measure>Dementia Care Professional Competency Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators will evaluate before the intervention, and after intervention for 1, 3, and 6 months. Change from Baseline Dementia Care Professional Competency at 1, 3, and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was developed by our past research that was supported by the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant Number 106-2511-S-255-002-MY3). The scale is used to evaluate dementia care competency in dementia case managers (Huang et al., 2018).&#xD;
This Scale contains nine subscales (74 items), using Likert 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5. A higher score means better competencies.&#xD;

    <measure>Problem solving, Teamwork Competency Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators will evaluate before the intervention, and after intervention for 1, 3, and 6 months. Change from Baseline Problem solving, Teamwork Competency at 1, 3, and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was developed by our past research that was supported by the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant Number 106-2511-S-255-002-MY3). There are 22 questions on this scale. The scale is used to evaluate the problem solving and teamwork competency of Dementia case managers. (Huang et al. 2018).&#xD;
This scale contains 22 items.10 items were used to evaluate problem solving competencies, 12 items were used to evaluate teamwork competencies. A higher score means better competencies.&#xD;

    <measure>Caregiver Preparedness Scale - Professional version</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators will evaluate before the intervention, and after intervention for 1, 3, and 6 months. Change from Baseline Caregiver Preparedness - Professional at 1,3, and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was developed by our research team by referring to The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale (PCS) developed by Archbold et al. This scale is to rate how well prepared they believe they are for caregiving (Archbold et al.,1990; Huang, Kuo, et al., 2013).&#xD;
This 11-items scale was scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (unprepared) to 5 (well prepared). Scores range from 11 to 55, with higher scores representing greater preparedness for caregiving tasks. A final question is an open-end question.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Basic information of dementia and family caregivers</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators will evaluate before the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The persons with dementia include age, gender, education level, marital status, degree of dementia, period of illness, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), etc. The family caregivers include age, gender, education level, marital status, etc.&#xD;
This scale is used to evaluate family caregivers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators will evaluate before the intervention, and after intervention for 1, 3, and 6 months. Change from Baseline behavioral problems (CMAI) at 1, 3, and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Dementia's behavioral problems were measured by the Chinese version of the CMAI, community form (Cohen-Mansfield, J et al. 1989, 1991, C.K.Y. Lai, pers. comm.).&#xD;
The 43-item CMAI has four subscales that assess four groups of behavioral problems: physically non-aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior, verbally aggressive behavior and verbally non-aggressive behavior. Each item's score ranges from 1 (never happened) to 7 (several times in an hour). Scores can range from 43-301, with higher scores representing more frequent or more types of behavioral problems.&#xD;
This scale is used to evaluate family caregivers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Agitation Management Self-Efficacy Scale (AMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators will evaluate before the intervention, and after intervention for 1, 3, and 6 months. Change from Baseline caregiver self-efficacy to handle behavioral problems (AMSS) at 1, 3, and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Family caregivers' self-efficacy for caring agitated behavior of older people with dementia was measured by the Agitation Management Self-Efficacy Scale (AMSS), which was developed by our research team. (Huang, Shyu, Chen, &amp; Hsu, 2009)&#xD;
For each of the 43 behavioral problems identified by the Chinese version of the CMAI, caregivers are asked how confident they feel about handling the problem. Each AMSS item is scored on a Likert-type scale from 1 (not able to handle at all) to 5 (totally able to handle). Total scores range from 43-215. Higher scores represent greater caregiver self-efficacy to handle behavioral problems.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities of daily living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators will evaluate before the intervention, and after intervention for 1, 3, and 6 months. Change from Baseline ADL at 1, 3, and 6 months.</time_frame>

The ADL refers to activities oriented toward taking care of one's own body.&#xD;
This scale assesses 10 items related to the activity including feeding, transfer, grooming, toilet use, bathing, mobility, stairs, dressing, bowels, and bladder. Each item is scored from 0 (maximum disability and dependency) to 20 (maximum strength and independence). Scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing more independence.&#xD;

This scale assesses 8 items related to the activity including the ability to use a phone, shopping, the model of transportation, meal preparation, housekeeping, laundry, the responsibility for owns medication, and the ability to handle finance.
