    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial of NEOADJUVANT FOLFIRINOX CHEMOTHERAPY WITH PEMBROLIZUMAB followed&#xD;
      by SURGERY and Adjuvant PEMBROLIZUMAB for Patients with LOCALIZED, RESECTABLE Adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      of the pancreas. Investigators hypothesize that appropriately timed neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      with anti-PD-1 mAb (pembrolizumab) can be administered safely and feasibly, and that this&#xD;
      combination will lead to improved clinical response associated with enhanced numbers of&#xD;
      immune cells in surgically resected pancreatic tumors. Patients will receive 6 cycles of&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX with 2 cycles of PEMBROLIZUMAB before surgical resection. Following surgery&#xD;
      patients will receive 5FU based chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles with 5 more cycles of&#xD;
      PEMBROLIZUMAB. Patients will receive a total of 9 doses of Q6week cycles of PEMBROLIZUMAB.&#xD;
      Investigators will perform an interim safety report after the first 5 patients. At which&#xD;
      time, investigators will stop accrual for 6 weeks after the 6th subject receives his first&#xD;
      dose of pembrolizumab to make sure that toxicities observed are in line with prior experience&#xD;
      with pembro and FOLFIRINOX when given individually and that there is no concern for&#xD;
      synergistic toxicity.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>survivals will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves, and a one-sample log-rank test will be used to compare the survival curve of neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX in combination with pembrolizumab to that of a historic control.

    <description>The safety analysis will be conducted for all subjects who have received at least one dose of study drug. Toxicities will be tabulated by type and grade (per CTCAE v. 4), and summary tables will be created to include laboratory abnormalities as well as frequency of dose interruptions, dose reductions and treatment discontinuation. Descriptive statistics of adverse events (AEs) will be reported for all patients, patients who discontinue due to AEs, and patients with related AEs. Severity, duration, investigator attributed relationship to treatment, and outcomes of AEs will be reported.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has borderline resectable, locally advanced unresectable or advanced&#xD;
             metastatic disease. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors, adenosquamous cancer,&#xD;
             lymphoma of the pancreas, or ampullary cancer are also ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring&#xD;
             systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has known infection with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (-e.g. diagnostic&#xD;
             laparoscopy or placement of a central venous catheter), within 4 weeks prior to Day 1&#xD;
             of treatment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems such&#xD;
             that the Investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive chemotherapy&#xD;
             and/or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 2 years. Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ (eg, breast carcinoma, cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has had clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, serious&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia) â‰¤ 1 year before randomization.&#xD;

             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients aged â‰¥ 80 are not excluded. However, candidates in this age group should be&#xD;
             thoroughly evaluated before enrollment in the study, to ensure they are fit to receive&#xD;
             chemotherapy, and to potentially undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy. In addition to&#xD;
             meeting all of the baseline patient selection criteria, clinical judgment on their&#xD;
             susceptibility to infection and expected stability of their performance status and&#xD;
             suitability to receive intensive chemotherapy cycles, should be paid special attention&#xD;
             to. Patients should not be enrolled in the study should there be any hesitation on any&#xD;
             of these considerations. Baseline criteria for all patients enrolled on the study must&#xD;
             be carefully evaluated and all criteria followed appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has evidence of peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 or higher.&#xD;

             prior to allocation (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot be&#xD;
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. In the event that 72&#xD;
             hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be&#xD;
             negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with&#xD;
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,&#xD;
             OX-40, CD137).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required&#xD;
             steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.&#xD;

             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as detectable HCV by RNA)&#xD;

             mandated by local health authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.&#xD;
