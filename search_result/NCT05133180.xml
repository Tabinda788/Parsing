    <textblock>
      The study objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of cenegermin (rhNGF) ophthalmic&#xD;
      solution at 20 mcg/mL concentration administered three times daily for 4 weeks in patients&#xD;
      with severe Sjogren's dry eye disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4 week phase III, multicenter, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of cenegermin ophthalmic solution at 20 mcg/mL solution versus vehicle,&#xD;
      in patients with severe Sjogren's dry eye disease. During the screening all procedures for&#xD;
      inclusion will be performed. From the day of screening the patients will stop any kind of&#xD;
      further treatment, except commercially available preservative free artificial tears provided&#xD;
      by Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the wash out period, patients meeting the entry criteria for this study will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 and treated for 4 weeks with either cenegermin ophthalmic solution 20 mcg/mL&#xD;
      TID or vehicle TID. During the 4 weeks of masked treatment only the administration of IMP is&#xD;
      allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow up period, the patient can administer additional artificial tear eye drops,&#xD;
      provided by Sponsor, only if strictly needed, and must document in the patient's diary the&#xD;
      number of additional drops administered for each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be followed up for efficacy and safety endpoints until week 16 and for&#xD;
      safety endpoints until week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is 25 weeks including 1 week of screening.&#xD;
