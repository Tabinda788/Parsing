    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about postoperative pain management after cesarean deliveries&#xD;
      (C-sections). As a part of standard of care, the Children's Hospital Colorado's Colorado&#xD;
      Fetal Care Center (CFCC) follows the standard Enhanced Recovery After Cesarean (ERAC)&#xD;
      guidelines to manage pain following C-section delivery. In addition, the CFCC uses an FDA&#xD;
      approved medical device called the ON-Q ® Pump, which continuously delivers local anesthetic&#xD;
      medication to control pain in the area of your procedure. The local anesthetic used is&#xD;
      bupivacaine, which is FDA approved for use to control local pain after C-sections. The CFCC&#xD;
      has found a significant reduction in opioid use after adopting both of these procedures. The&#xD;
      study aims to determine if the ERAC protocol or ON-Q ® Pump continuous infusion is&#xD;
      responsible for lower opioid use by comparing bupivacaine (treatment) versus saline (placebo)&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
