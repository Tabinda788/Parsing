  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and is increasingly diagnosed&#xD;
      prenatally. While prenatal diagnosis can be beneficial for the infant in that it facilitates&#xD;
      medical care immediately following birth, mothers describe their prenatal experiences as&#xD;
      highly stressful and traumatic. Maternal stress during pregnancy exerts a powerful influence&#xD;
      on birth outcomes and developmental trajectories, particularly for children in underserved&#xD;
      populations. In partnership with diverse parent and clinician stakeholders, our team designed&#xD;
      HEARTPrep, an innovative, virtually-delivered psychosocial intervention for mothers expecting&#xD;
      a baby with CHD. This project will pilot recruitment into HEARTPrep and delivery of this&#xD;
      novel intervention to obtain preliminary data for a larger future trial. This intervention&#xD;
      has the potential to improve emotional wellbeing in mothers expecting a baby with CHD,&#xD;
      thereby altering developmental trajectories for this large population of children.&#xD;

      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and is increasingly diagnosed&#xD;
      prenatally. While prenatal diagnosis can be beneficial for the infant in that it facilitates&#xD;
      medical care immediately following birth, mothers describe their prenatal experiences as&#xD;
      highly stressful and traumatic. Maternal stress during pregnancy exerts a powerful influence&#xD;
      on birth outcomes and developmental trajectories, particularly for children in underserved&#xD;
      populations. Targeted efforts to mitigate impacts of maternal stress for this highly&#xD;
      vulnerable population are lacking. In partnership with diverse parent and clinician&#xD;
      stakeholders, our team designed HEARTPrep, an innovative, virtually-delivered psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention for mothers expecting a baby with CHD. HEARTPrep will be delivered in English&#xD;
      and Spanish through the Nemours App, an accessible tool for telehealth and patient education.&#xD;
      We aim to (Aim 1) examine the feasibility of enrolling mothers expecting a baby with CHD into&#xD;
      a psychosocial intervention trial and identify barriers and facilitators to recruitment, (Aim&#xD;
      2) evaluate initial acceptability and feasibility of HEARTPrep for mothers expecting a baby&#xD;
      with CHD and determine if and how intervention elements should be individualized to address&#xD;
      diverse family needs, and (Aim 3) explore whether HEARTPrep produces clinically significant&#xD;
      improvements on outcomes. This program of research has the potential to improve emotional&#xD;
      wellbeing in mothers expecting a baby with CHD, thereby altering developmental trajectories&#xD;
      for this large population of children.&#xD;

    <description>HEARTPrep is a virtually-delivered psychosocial intervention for mothers expecting a baby with CHD and their partners. HEARTPrep consists of three distinct modules: Adjusting, Connecting, and Preparing. Each module targets one distinct primary outcome (emotional distress, social isolation, parenting self-efficacy) and a common secondary outcome (hope) through a suite of evidence-based intervention elements (e.g., psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness) for addressing emotional problems in other populations, including pregnant women. HEARTPrep elements include: a) telehealth with a psychosocial provider, b) recorded videos, c) educational tools, and d) links to resources.</description>
