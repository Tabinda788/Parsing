    <textblock>
      The composite effect of reduced balance, cognition, gait abnormalities/gait disturbances, and&#xD;
      physical activity in older adults leads to fear of falling and decreased participation in&#xD;
      daily activities, resulting in reduced cardiovascular fitness and deconditioning. Although&#xD;
      many conventional balance and strength training programs have been implemented for older&#xD;
      adults, these adults do not receive adequate practice dosage to make significant&#xD;
      improvements, most likely due to lack of adherence to therapy and/or inadequate incorporation&#xD;
      of all domains of the ICF model (body functions and structures, activities and participation)&#xD;
      and lack of targeting cognitive-motor interference (deterioration of motor and/or cognitive&#xD;
      function when both tasks are performed together). The use of TeleXercise via Tele&#xD;
      rehabilitation has been found to be relatively enjoyable for older adults due to increased&#xD;
      motivation and adherence to therapy, which led to the added improvement of physical and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning. The overall aim of this pilot is to develop and test the Mimic-Me &amp;&#xD;
      Groove TeleXercise platform and then evaluate the compliance and efficacy of the TeleXercise&#xD;
      intervention compared to control group receiving standard of care (education on conventional&#xD;
      exercise and fall prevention program) for older adults as well as its effect on enhancing&#xD;
      balance, gait, and cognition, and physical activity. Investigators also hope that the net&#xD;
      effect of improvement in these domains of health outcomes will result in pre and post&#xD;
      improvement in endurance and cardiovascular function and reduction of fall risk and improved&#xD;
      quality of life of older adults. The study investigates the efficacy of a TeleXercise&#xD;
      intervention in older adults by demonstrating its feasibility, compliance rate and also&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of the Mimic-Me &amp; Groove TeleXercise in improving health outcomes such&#xD;
      as motor and cognitive functions, thereby reducing cognitive-motor interference. The study&#xD;
      will also aim to determine the effectiveness of the TeleXercise in improving cardiovascular&#xD;
      fitness and physical activity (PA) in older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging results in neuromuscular deterioration, such as impaired balance control, gait&#xD;
      instability, and worsening cognition with increasing evidence pointing to the over-reliance&#xD;
      on cognitive function to perform even simple motor tasks. Such deterioration has been shown&#xD;
      to affect daily functional activities, quality of life, and cardiovascular fitness, along&#xD;
      with an increase in the risk of falling. Physical activity has been recommended as a means to&#xD;
      slow down neuromuscular deterioration and enhance gait, stability, and cognition in older&#xD;
      adults. Further, increased levels of physical activity have also demonstrated positive&#xD;
      effects on cardiovascular fitness (heart rate variability, HRV).However, older adults do not&#xD;
      meet the recommended daily requirement (of at least 5000 steps/day) due to reduced motivation&#xD;
      and lack of compliance to physical activity regimen. The lack of compliance may emanate from&#xD;
      difficulty to commute to outpatient rehabilitation centers, lack of involvement, and the&#xD;
      decreased participatory nature of most conventional physical therapy interventions. As a&#xD;
      result, there is the need to implement a home-based TeleXercise intervention for older&#xD;
      adults. This TeleXercise intervention should be motivational and enjoyable with increased&#xD;
      participation or involvement, while aiming to improve cognition, physical activity and&#xD;
      balance for fall prevention in older adults. Exercise training provided via Tele&#xD;
      rehabilitation, as an alternative therapy, has shown to increase balance control and gait as&#xD;
      well as increase motivation among older adults. Further, our preliminary studies conducted in&#xD;
      the laboratory has shown promising results on various alternative methods for rehabilitating&#xD;
      older adults. Among which exergaming-based dance therapy has exhibited feasibility in&#xD;
      improving balance, mobility and cardiovascular function, along with decreasing fall risk.&#xD;
      Also, older adults exhibit deterioration of balance control and gait in dual-task conditions&#xD;
      (i.e., simultaneous performance of two tasks). Few systematic reviews have emphasized on some&#xD;
      task-specific exercises to improve balance control in older adults, such as single leg&#xD;
      stance, modified tree pose etc. Thus, it could be postulated that older adults could benefit&#xD;
      from an integrated comprehensive therapy program which incorporates various physical&#xD;
      exercises, such as conventional methods of balance exercises, exergaming-based balance games,&#xD;
      and dance with cognitive training. However, there is no data on the feasibility and effect of&#xD;
      such comprehensive therapy on efficacy, compliance, balance, cognitive, gait and physical&#xD;
      activity measures among older adults. Given that older adults lack compliance to therapy,&#xD;
      investigators therefore, seek to examine the feasibility of a comprehensive TeleXercise-based&#xD;
      intervention through the use of a comprehensive intervention protocol incorporating various&#xD;
      physical exercises. Specifically, task-specific balance training provided via observing and&#xD;
      imitating an exercise activates Action Observation Network system (AON) and other brain&#xD;
      centers, which is known to improve balance control through increased plasticity of neural&#xD;
      systems (mirror neurons) for optimal observation and actual performance of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim1: The study will test the applicability, feasibility and compliance of TeleXercise&#xD;
      intervention (N=17) to improve physical function and reduce fall-risk in community-dwelling&#xD;
      older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants will tolerate the training paradigm and will demonstrate significant&#xD;
      improvements in balance, gait, cardiovascular and cognitive performance under single and&#xD;
      dual-task conditions. Participants will also demonstrate appropriate compliance (attend&#xD;
      &gt;24/30 session) and motivation (&gt;Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores) post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine if the proposed TeleXercise intervention will lead to higher cognitive&#xD;
      function post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants will show significantly greater global cognitive function, executive&#xD;
      and working memory and decreased cognitive-motor load post-training compared to pre-training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the effect of TeleXercise intervention on improving physical fitness&#xD;
      (physical activity, PA) of community-based older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Post-training measures will depict a significant improvement in physical&#xD;
      activity fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary hypothesis: To determine if improved cognitive-motor function and physical fitness&#xD;
      gained from a TeleXercise intervention will translate into improved falls efficacy, quality&#xD;
      of life and physical activity post withdrawal of intervention with reduced fatigue and&#xD;
      exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: At 8 weeks (4 weeks post-intervention or withdrawal), participants will have&#xD;
      retention of the post-training gains in single and dual-task conditions and cardiovascular&#xD;
      fitness, which will translate into improved falls efficacy (improvement on&#xD;
      Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale), quality of life (Older People's Quality of&#xD;
      Life Questionnaire (OPQOL-35) and participation (improved Community Integration Scale)&#xD;
      compared to their pre-training. Participants will also show improved falls efficacy&#xD;
      translated to improved community ambulation (physical activity) and reduced fatigue and&#xD;
      exertion (Borg Scale, NASA TLX scale)&#xD;
