  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke, according to the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO); It is a syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by a rapid settlement of signs and symptoms of focal loss of cerebral function&#xD;
      without a cause other than vascular causes. As it is known, it is important for patients to&#xD;
      regain functional skills in the upper extremities after stroke. Modified-Constraint Induced&#xD;
      Movement Therapy (m-CIMT) is a versatile neurorehabilitation technique that aims to improve&#xD;
      motor function in the hemiparetic upper extremity and increase its use in daily life&#xD;
      activities. However, as in the Covid-19 pandemic, patients cannot always reach rehabilitation&#xD;
      services. In such cases, telerehabilitation is a treatment option. There are a limited number&#xD;
      of studies in which m-CIMT is applied according to the principle of telerehabilitation, which&#xD;
      has become a necessity, especially due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      study is to examine the effects of m-CIMT on upper extremity motor functions in stroke&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized controlled study. The patients will be randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups as exercise and control. Patients in both groups will be given lower-upper extremity&#xD;
      exercises and gait training exercises selected according to the Bobath approach as a home&#xD;
      program consisting of 10 exercises to be applied 5 days a week for 3 weeks. All patients will&#xD;
      perform the same exercises. In addition, the exercise group will receive Modified-Constraint&#xD;
      Induced Movement Therapy (m-CIMT) based telerehabilitation via video conferencing 5 days a&#xD;
      week for 3 weeks. Patients in the m-CIMT group will be asked to restrict the movements of&#xD;
      their less affected hands by using mitt for 5 hours a day/ 5 days a week for 3 weeks while&#xD;
      the patients are awake. Evaluations for both groups will be made by a physiotherapist blinded&#xD;
      to the study twice, at the beginning and 3 weeks later. As outcome measures functional&#xD;
      performance, hand strength, activities of daily living and quality of life will be evaluated.&#xD;
