    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of guided and unguided online transdiagnostic self-help&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for reducing anxiety and/or depression symptoms in&#xD;
      Hong-kong residents. Numerous literature demonstrates online self-help interventions'&#xD;
      efficacy on depression and anxiety (Lattie et al., 2019; Saddichha et al., 2014).&#xD;
      Nonetheless, existing research overlooks the mechanism of change, the online treatment&#xD;
      outcome's potential predictors, and the effect of therapist's guidance on participants'&#xD;
      treatment expectancy and its mediating effect on treatment outcome, which are essential to&#xD;
      optimize intervention's efficacy (Kazdin, 2007; Mogoașe et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      96 Hong-kong residents, aged 18-65, with mild to moderate anxiety and/or depression will be&#xD;
      recruited. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either guided group (Group-1)&#xD;
      or unguided group (Group-2) or waitlist control group (Group-3) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Group-1&#xD;
      will receive weekly manualized progress feedback from trained researchers under supervision,&#xD;
      after each weekly treatment. Group-2 will not receive the aforementioned feedback. Group-1&#xD;
      and Group-2 will receive reminders on the 5th, 6th and 7th day if weekly treatment is not&#xD;
      completed. All participants will complete baseline assessments before treatment, six weekly&#xD;
      treatments (except Group-3), a post-treatment assessment immediately and four-week after&#xD;
      treatment. Randomly selected participants will complete an individual interview after&#xD;
      treatment. Feedback will be gathered through a phone call to improve the intervention in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a pilot randomized control trial that examines the efficacy of guided and&#xD;
      unguided transdiagnostic online self-help cognitive behavioral therapy for reducing symptoms&#xD;
      of anxiety and depression in the Hong Kong adult resident population. Despite online&#xD;
      self-help intervention has been widely recognized by its efficacy in improving depression and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, the existing literature overlooks the mechanism of change and the potential&#xD;
      predictors of online treatment outcome, as well as the effect of therapist's guidance on&#xD;
      participants' treatment expectancy and its mediating effect on treatment outcome (Lattie et&#xD;
      al., 2019; Saddichha et al., 2014). However, the aforementioned research gaps are essential&#xD;
      for optimizing the efficacy of online self-help interventions (Kazdin, 2007; Mogoașe et al.,&#xD;
      2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to all study procedures, online informed consent with phone support will be obtained&#xD;
      from potential participants. Around 96 eligible participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either guided intervention group or unguided intervention group or waitlist control group in&#xD;
      a ratio of 1:1:1. The randomization will be performed by an independent assessor using a&#xD;
      computer-generated list of numbers. No deception is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the guided intervention group will receive feedback calls (approximately&#xD;
      15 minutes) on participants' progress after each online self-help intervention session. The&#xD;
      check-in includes treatment concepts clarification, homework checking, and technical issues&#xD;
      solving. The check-ins will be delivered by a clinical psychology trainee or an undergraduate&#xD;
      trained psychology student under the supervision of a clinical psychology professor. The&#xD;
      participants in the unguided intervention group will not receive the aforementioned&#xD;
      check-ins. The participants in both guided and unguided intervention groups will receive an&#xD;
      email reminder and text message if the participants have not completed the required session&#xD;
      of that week on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of the same week. Both technical supports are available&#xD;
      for both groups. The waitlist unguided control group will not receive any online self-help&#xD;
      intervention. All participants will complete a set of baseline assessments before the first&#xD;
      session, a post-treatment assessment immediately after treatment, and a post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment four-week after the treatment. Apart from the waitlist control group, both guided&#xD;
      and unguided intervention groups will receive a total of six weekly online treatments.&#xD;
      Randomly selected participants will complete an individual interview after treatment.&#xD;
      Feedback will be gathered through a phone call to improve the intervention in the future.&#xD;
