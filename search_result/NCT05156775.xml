  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided rhomboid plane&#xD;
      block or serratus plane block versus Intravenous opioid in patients undergoing modified&#xD;
      radical mastectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and is the leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related death among the female population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified radical mastectomy (MRM) is the standard surgical treatment for cancer breast, which&#xD;
      is usually associated with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. Adequate&#xD;
      postoperative pain relief is important to improve functional outcomes and to accelerate&#xD;
      recovery and decrease hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative pain may last &gt;3 to 6 months after surgery and may proceed to chronic pain,&#xD;
      with an incidence of 20% to 30%. Because chronic pain has many negative effects on patients,&#xD;
      it may decrease the overall quality of life and may be a potential source of chronic opioid&#xD;
      use. Therefore, preventing chronic pain is essential in these patients. In this regard, good&#xD;
      acute postoperative pain management strategies have a very important role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia techniques can provide good postoperative pain management and may cause&#xD;
      less incidence of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many analgesic techniques have been proposed to relieve acute postoperative pain, including&#xD;
      intercostal block, local anesthetic (LA) infiltration, block, paravertebral block, serratus&#xD;
      plane block (SPB), and rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) to relieve acute postoperative pain&#xD;

    <description>Rescue analgesia in the form of 3 mg intravenous morphine (mg) will be given if the visual analog scale is ≥ 4 repeated with 10 minutes lockout interval till the visual analog scale becomes less than 3 guided with the occurrence of complications as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression.</description>

    <measure>Time to first rescue analgesic request (minutes)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours Postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Time to the first rescue analgesic request (minutes) will be also recorded. Rescue analgesia in the form of 3 mg intravenous morphine (mg) will be given if the visual analog scale is ≥ 4</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative fentanyl consumption (µg).</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Inadequate analgesia in the form of increase of heart rate or mean arterial blood pressure ≥ 20% above the baseline will be managed using 1µg/ kg of IV fentanyl. The total intravenous fentanyl consumption will be recorded at the end of the operation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative or 24 hours Postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Any intraoperative or postoperative complications such as nausea, vomiting, hematoma, hypotension (defined as any decrease in mean arterial blood pressure of &gt;20% of the preoperative baseline value), Bradycardia (defined as a decrease in heart rate &lt; 50 beat/min), or pneumothorax will be recorded. Bradycardia will be treated by atropine intravenous injection (0.01 mg/kg) which may be repeated if needed. Hypotension will be treated by250 ml intravenous saline, and a bolus dose of intravenous Ephedrine 5 mg, which may be repeated if no response.</description>

    <description>While the patient is in the supine position, the arm will be abducted, the ultrasound probe will be placed over the mid-clavicular region of the thoracic cage in sagittal plane. Ribs will be counted until the fifth rib will be identified in the midaxillary line. the latissimus dorsi (superficial and posterior ), teres major (superior), and serratus muscle (deep and inferior)will be identified overlying the fifth rib. As an extra reference point, thoracodorsal artery will be used, this aids in the identification of the plane superficial to the serratus muscle, 30 ml 0.25 %bupivacaine will be injected between latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles at the level of the 5th rib in the mid axillary line.</description>

    <description>In the rhomboid intercostal nerve block (RIB) group, the patient will be placed in a lateral position with the affected breast at the top. The ipsilateral arm will be extended to the same level as the ipsilateral chest and breast, and the scapula will be moved outward. On the oblique sagittal plane, a high frequency (6-12MHz) linear ultrasound probe will be placed on the medial edge of the scapula. The US landmarks, trapezius muscle, rhomboid muscle, intercostal muscles, pleura, and lung will be identified. Under the aseptic condition, a 22-gauge needle will be inserted in the plan to the US probe at T5 to T6 levels. Then, 0.25% bupivacaine (30 mL) will be injected into the inter-fascial plane between the rhomboid major muscle and the intercostal muscle, the diffusion of bupivacaine in the fascia between the rhomboid muscle and the intercostal muscle will be visualized. Then, the patient will be positioned in supine position.</description>
