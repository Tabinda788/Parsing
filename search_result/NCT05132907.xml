  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase 1 study is to assess tolerability and immunogenicity of three dose levels of&#xD;
      the investigational HDT-301 vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM), both in&#xD;
      immunization-naïve participants and as a booster for those participants who previously&#xD;
      received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be the primary endpoint assessed by incidence of adverse events&#xD;
      at each dose through 12 months after completion of the vaccination regimen (either one dose,&#xD;
      or two doses provided 56 days apart). Immunogenicity evaluations will be conducted for&#xD;
      pre-specified timepoints as secondary and exploratory endpoints.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-ranging, study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      investigational HDT-301 vaccine in healthy (vaccinated or unvaccinated) adult subjects, with&#xD;
      a 4:3 recruitment of individual aged 18-49 years and 50-65 years, respectively. The study&#xD;
      duration is approximately 13 or 14 months for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cohorts of 21 subjects each will be sequentially recruited in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort 1 will include individuals with vaccination against COVID-19 who will receive a&#xD;
           two-dose schedule of HDT-301 56 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort 2 will include individuals with vaccination against COVID-19 who will receive a&#xD;
           one-dose schedule of HDT-301.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cohort 3 will include individuals with no history of vaccination against COVID-19 who&#xD;
           will receive a two-dose schedule of HDT-301 56 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting and screening of participants will be conducted on a continual basis. Subjects&#xD;
      confirmed to be Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine recipients will first be&#xD;
      placed into either Cohort 1 (Study Days 1 and 57; Two-Dose Regimen) or Cohort 2 (Study Day 1;&#xD;
      One-Dose Regimen) then subsequently placed into each of the three dose groups. Subjects in&#xD;
      the Cohort 3 (naïve, unimmunized) subset will be placed into each of the three dose groups to&#xD;
      receive the study vaccine on Study Days 1 and 57 (Two-Dose Regimen). Each cohort will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups of 7 participants, that will be provided HDT-301 at either a low-, mid-&#xD;
      or high-dose. For each of the three-dose groups, a sentinel group will be initially enrolled&#xD;
      and followed through Day 8 post-dose one for safety. If no halting rules are met by Day 8&#xD;
      enrollment will proceed to the remaining subjects. Blood samples will be collected during the&#xD;
      study for each participant.&#xD;
