      after being informed about the study and potential risks. All patients giving written consent&#xD;
      will be randomized by double-blind manner into 2groups each one containing 15 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1(n =15 ):the patients will receive nimodipine (60 mg/4 hours) orally or via&#xD;
      nasogastric tube In group 2(n =15 ): the patients will receive Oral Nimodipine (60 mg/4) will&#xD;
      be given orally or in the gastric tube also from the first day of admission, then after the&#xD;
      diagnosis of vasospasm is confirmed, start milrinone.&#xD;

Severe Disability: The The patient is conscious but needs the assistance of another person for some activities of daily living every day.….&quot; &quot;4. Moderate Disability: Such a patient is able to look after himself at home, to get out and about to the shops and to travel by public transport. However, some previous activities, either at work or in social life, are now no longer possible by reason of either physical or mental deficit….&quot; &quot;5. Good Recovery: This indicates the capacity to resume normal occupational and social activities, although there may be minor physical or mental deficits…social outcome should be included in the assessment here, such as leisure activities and family relationships..</description>

    <description>The patients will receive oral Nimodipine (60 mg/4) will be given orally or in the gastric tube also from the first day of admission, then after the diagnosis of vasospasm is confirmed, start milrinone bolus of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg followed by 0.75mcg/k/min, if no response after 30min increase the infusion to 1-25mcg/kg/min with maintaining CVP 5:8.&#xD;
Norepinephrine (0.01-0.2ug/kg/min) is used only to restore the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to its previous values If there was no recurrence of symptoms after 72 h, we decreased the milrinone infusion by 0.25 mcg/kg/min every 24 or 48 h until discontinuation. If there are any recurrent of symptoms of vasospasm, the patients are placed back on the dose they were previously receiving. If required, another Milrinone bolus is administered if the patient's deficits do not revert12.</description>
