  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients with heart disease should have the opportunity to participate in research into&#xD;
      their condition, to advance knowledge and treatment. We have built an online registry and&#xD;
      database - The Heart Hive - to connect research-willing participants (with heart muscle&#xD;
      disease) with active researchers and projects. Participants enrol and upload their own data&#xD;
      through the website.This study uses The Heart Hive platform to study cardiomyopathies - heart&#xD;
      muscle disease. These are progressive diseases, and there is a need to better understand what&#xD;
      factors affect the chances of developing cardiomyopathy, and how the condition progresses.&#xD;
      The study will collect information about participants diagnosis, DNA for genetic analysis,&#xD;
      and then follow participants' clinical progress. The study will identify genetic variants&#xD;
      that cause cardiomyopathy, and determine which specific genetic or environmental factors&#xD;
      predict disease severity, progression and response to treatment, with an overall objective of&#xD;
      identifying new and personalised treatments for patients with this disease.&#xD;

      This is a multi-centre, observational study of children with rare inherited cardiac&#xD;
      conditions. The focus of the study will be on children with clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and their unaffected parents, with collection of baseline demographic data,&#xD;
      imaging data, and genotyping data. Children and their parents will been rolled over a 5-year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-sets of patients with confirmed diagnoses of other heritable cardiovascular diseases with&#xD;
      onset &lt;16 years will also be recruited.These will include children who following evaluation&#xD;
      by their clinical multidisciplinary team (which will include a geneticist or genetic&#xD;
      counsellor) are likely to have a rare monogenic condition. Other affected family members of&#xD;
      eligible patients may be also invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information for this study will be collected primarily from investigations performed as part&#xD;
      of the participants' routine clinical care including whole genome sequencing commissioned by&#xD;
      NHS England. The study will seek consent to access and export this data. Procedures performed&#xD;
      as part of this study may include venepuncture and/or saliva collection and carry minimal&#xD;
      risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of participants that are recruited into the study will donate a blood sample (or&#xD;
      saliva sample if unable to provide blood) and consent will be requested for collection of&#xD;
      health information and results of relevant investigations carried out as part of their&#xD;
      routine clinical care (e.g. an echocardiogram). Other family members that are recruited into&#xD;
      the study will donate a blood sample (or saliva sample if unable to provide blood) and&#xD;
      consent will be requested for collection of health information. Family members of deceased&#xD;
      patients with cardiomyopathy or other inherited cardiac conditions may be asked if they wish&#xD;
      to donate stored samples that may have been taken prior to death or as part of a post-mortem&#xD;
      examination to establish cause of death. Any discussion with regard to the use of stored&#xD;
      samples for this project will be initiated by the clinical care team for the deceased patient&#xD;
      and their family to minimise any potential distress to the family. Sub-sets of patients may&#xD;
      be asked to donate tissue samples taken as part of their clinical care.&#xD;
