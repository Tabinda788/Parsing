  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized control study to determine if video&#xD;
      education at the time of postpartum discharge improves patient knowledge on the warning signs&#xD;
      for the top three causes of severe maternal morbidity (infection, hemorrhage, and blood&#xD;
      pressure disorders) in the first seven days following delivery. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to written discharge education + video education (intervention) vs standard&#xD;
      discharge education (control). They will complete a baseline questionnaire and a&#xD;
      post-discharge education questionnaire during their postpartum stay to assess for knowledge&#xD;
      improvement. The investigators hypothesize that video education will increase patient's&#xD;
      knowledge of severe maternal morbidity warning signs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During postpartum admission, a designated staff person will approach eligible patients and&#xD;
      review the objectives of the study. If patients are willing to participate, they will be&#xD;
      handed a tablet that includes the consent form and the baseline questionnaire. The baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire will assess patient knowledge on postpartum hemorrhage, infection, hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders of pregnancy, and depression. Randomization will follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done in a 1:1 allocation ratio between written discharge instructions +&#xD;
      video education vs. written discharge instructions (standard of care at YNHH). A computer&#xD;
      algorithm will assign participant based on random permuted blocks design with block size&#xD;
      between 2-4. Each participant will have an assigned Study ID number that is linked to their&#xD;
      random assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day of discharge, nursing staff will notify the research team that a discharge order has&#xD;
      been placed and discharge education has begun. At this time, the designated staff member will&#xD;
      approach consented and randomized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will be the written discharge education + video education group (intervention group).&#xD;
      These patients will view a 10-minute educational video on SMM warning signs, in addition to&#xD;
      the written discharge instructions provided by nursing staff. At the completion of the video,&#xD;
      they will complete a post-video questionnaire to assess their knowledge on the covered&#xD;
      topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will be the written discharge instruction group (control group). They will receive&#xD;
      the written discharge instructions provided by nursing staff and complete the post-discharge&#xD;
      instruction questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' antepartum, delivery, and postpartum course will be reviewed until 1 year&#xD;
      postpartum, including outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and any&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be assigned a unique study ID code upon enrollment. Data will be collected&#xD;
      from patients' medical records and from self-report. It will be recorded/stored in REDCap and&#xD;
      on a Yale server accessible only to members of the research team. All data will be&#xD;
      de-identified at the conclusion of chart review. Data analysts will have access to only&#xD;
      de-identified information.&#xD;
