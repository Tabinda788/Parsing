  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), the third most abundant constituent of breastmilk, are&#xD;
      known to have beneficial effects on infant immunity. Maternal genetic polymorphisms cause HMO&#xD;
      variability. The FUT2 gene determines the secretor status, whereas the FUT3 gene is&#xD;
      responsible for the expression of Lewis fucosyltransferase. Therefore, breastmilk can be&#xD;
      classified to four groups according to the variation. To date, this variability has not been&#xD;
      investigated in Indonesia. This study aims to evaluate the association between FUT2 gene&#xD;
      polymorphism and 2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL) secretor phenotype. In addition, infant FUT2 gene&#xD;
      polymorphism and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile from stool samples are also analysed.&#xD;

      Eligible mother-infant pairs are explained about this study. Those willing to participate in&#xD;
      this study are asked for written informed consent. Mothers are interviewed about their&#xD;
      baseline characteristics, family pedigree, nutritional intake, and routine drug consumption.&#xD;
      Infants are checked for their birth history. Both are measured for weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four specimens are collected from the subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mother&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Breastmilk&#xD;
&#xD;
                Breastmilk is expressed at 8-11 AM to avoid variability due to circadian rhythm.&#xD;
                One breast is emptied, 30 mL of breastmilk is stored in a sterile container, and&#xD;
                the rest is returned for feeding. Breastmilk is divided to five 2-mL cryovials and&#xD;
                stored in a -80°C freezer. The remaining is stored in a -20°C freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Blood&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood samples (3 mL) are collected for DNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infant&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Buccal cells&#xD;
&#xD;
                Buccal swab kits are used to obtain samples for DNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Stool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool specimens are collected at the age of four weeks in a sterile container and stored in a&#xD;
      -50°C storage before short chain fatty acid profile analysis.&#xD;
