  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of GENOSS DCB versus&#xD;
      IN.PACT Admiral DCB on late lumen loss 6 months after the procedure in patients with de novo&#xD;
      or non-stented restenotic lesions of the superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery and&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be conducted on a total of 104 patients at 11 domestic institutions&#xD;
      (taking into account the dropout rate of 20%).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, IN.PACT Admiral, which is the most similar to GENOSS DCB, a test&#xD;
      device, and the product type and purpose of use, and whose efficacy has already been proven&#xD;
      through numerous clinical studies, was selected as a control product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of this clinical trial, the investigator cannot be blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      method to which the subject is assigned, so it is designed as a double-blind design in which&#xD;
      only the subject and the independent evaluator are blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For efficacy and safety evaluation, follow-up is performed up to 12 months after procedure of&#xD;
      the clinical trial medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the efficay evaluation was performed by an independent evaluator and&#xD;
      CT angiography at 6 months of in-segment late lumen loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is evaluated the revascularization rate, Rutherford classification, the amount of change&#xD;
      in ABI or TBI at 1, 6, and 12 months, the procedural success rate during the clinical trial&#xD;
      period, and the device success rate immediately after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation is confirmed through all adverse events, MAE (Major adverse event), vital&#xD;
      signs, physical examination and laboratory test results that occur to the subject during the&#xD;
      clinical trial period after procedure of the clinical trial medical device.&#xD;
