  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response, safety and reactogenicity of&#xD;
      a third dose Covid-19 (recombinante) vaccine, 6 months after a two-dose vaccine schedule&#xD;
      using the same vaccine in all doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all participants giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be evaluated for eligibility criteria. At day 0, participants who meet&#xD;
      the eligibility requirements will undergo a thorough medical evaluation and a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test (if applicable). Previous vaccination information will be collected with the participant&#xD;
      and checked via digital Covid-19 vaccine certification from the Brazilian public health&#xD;
      national immunization program system (SI-PNI) ou from Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz)&#xD;
      institutional occupational medicine data. According to the data collected, participants will&#xD;
      be placed in one of two groups: 8 or 12 weeks interval between the first two vaccine doses in&#xD;
      the vaccine schedule. Eligible and consenting participants will have a blood sample collected&#xD;
      and receive immediately after a third dose of the Covid-19 (recombinante) vaccine.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to fill out an adverse events journal for solicited adverse&#xD;
      events for 7 days and non-solicited adverse events for 28 days after the third dose. The&#xD;
      research team will contact the participant remotely at least once during the first two weeks.&#xD;
      The participant will return for a follow-up visit to the research center 28 days after the&#xD;
      third dose, to evaluate adverse events, collect a second blood sample and undergo a thorough&#xD;
      medical evaluation. The participant will return to the research center to collect blood&#xD;
      samples in three more follow-up visits: 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the third&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
