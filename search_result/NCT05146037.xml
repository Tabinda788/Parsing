  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the processes of a pilot single-centre randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) of carbon-dioxide flushing of transcatheter aortic valves (TAVI-CO2) versus standard&#xD;
      saline flushing of valves (TAVI-S) and assess potential neuroprotection through a number of&#xD;
      neurological endpoints for planning of a full-sized RCT&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valve diseases and is increasing worldwide due&#xD;
      to an ageing population. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVI) is a keyhole procedure&#xD;
      that can be done through the groin to replace the narrowed aortic valve with a new valve,&#xD;
      avoiding the need for cardiac surgery.Improved device design and greater operator experience&#xD;
      has improved TAVI outcomes. It has become the standard treatment option in patients who are&#xD;
      at high risk for cardiac surgery and is now being used increasingly in lower risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebrovascular accidents in TAVI patients remain a significant risk with a reported 3 - 5 %&#xD;
      risk. Furthermore, these patients have neurovascular injury that is not clinically&#xD;
      identifiable. Covert brain injury has been identified to occur in many surgical and&#xD;
      cardiovascular catheter-based interventions such as TAVI and can cause vascular brain injury&#xD;
      (VBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAVI valves are manufactured in room air conditions and retain air. Studies in TEVAR&#xD;
      (Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair) stent grafts have shown release of air when they are&#xD;
      deployed in the aorta. In vitro testing of TAVI valves has shown release of air when they are&#xD;
      deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon-dioxide (CO2) is 1.5 times denser than air and can displace it. It is 25 times more&#xD;
      soluble in blood than air and does not lead to bubble formation. Hence CO2 bubble are&#xD;
      unlikely to result in significant damage. CO2 has been used in cardiac surgery with&#xD;
      beneficial effects. It has shown to reduce peri-procedural cerebral air embolisation and post&#xD;
      operative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to look at the neuroprotective benefits of flushing TAVI valves with CO2 and&#xD;
      saline versus saline only by reducing air embolisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing TAVI will be approached to participate in this study. After consent is&#xD;
      obtained, patients will undergo baseline MRI, neurological and neurocognitive testing&#xD;
      pre-TAVI. Patient will be randomised to saline only or CO2 and saline flushing of their&#xD;
      valves. During their TAVI procedure, they will have transcranial doppler (TCD) monitoring of&#xD;
      their middle cerebral artery (MCA) bilaterally to record cerebral embolisation. Patients will&#xD;
      also have biomarker testing pre-TAVI, post-TAVI and 24 hours following TAVI. They will have&#xD;
      DW-MRI brain between day 1-7 following their TAVI to look for vascular brain injury. Thus MRI&#xD;
      will be repeated at 6-months following their TAVI. Patients will also have neurological and&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing during their inpatient admission, at 6-weeks and 6-months outpatients.&#xD;
