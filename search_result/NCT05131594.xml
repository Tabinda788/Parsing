  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people who have had COVID 19 continue to experience symptoms long after they have&#xD;
      recovered from the acute infection. This study will examine the clinical symptoms of people&#xD;
      with &quot;Long COVID&quot; and measure various markers of inflammation in their blood.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who attend the Long Covid Recovery Clinic at Huntington Hospital will be offered&#xD;
      participation in the study. After giving written informed consent, their medical history&#xD;
      along with a description of clinical symptoms given through an extensive questionnaire will&#xD;
      be accessed. Venous blood will be collected as a baseline and then at follow up visits (as&#xD;
      dictated by changes in clinical symptomatology) for evaluation of corollary immune&#xD;
      parameters. Patients will be followed at a minimum of every 2 months for 2 years.&#xD;
