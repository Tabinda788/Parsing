    <description>The first dose of Modigraf should be administered in the morning within 24 hours after reperfusion. Participants will be treated with a Modigraf-based immunosuppressive regimen.&#xD;
The initial daily dose of Modigraf is given in two divided doses (recommended interval 12 hours) postoperatively. Subsequent oral Modigraf doses will be adjusted by the investigator based on clinical evidence of efficacy, occurrence of AEs, and tacrolimus whole blood trough level.</description>
