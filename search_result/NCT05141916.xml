  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choledocholithiasis (stone(s) in the common bile duct) is common. Untreated or missed,&#xD;
      choledocholithiasis has high morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is recognized as the first-line modality for management.&#xD;
      While effective, ERCP is associated with adverse events. Thus, the selection of patients for&#xD;
      ERCP should be accompanied by a high pre-test suspicion of choledocholithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choledocholithiasis is suspected based on clinical, biochemical and radiographic findings.&#xD;
      The most relied-upon strategy for risk stratification of choledocholithiasis is based on&#xD;
      guidelines from The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE). In it, clinical&#xD;
      predictors are defined as &quot;very strong&quot;, &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot;, and the presence of one or&#xD;
      more of these is meant to suggest &quot;high&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; probability of&#xD;
      choledocholithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A knowledge gap exists in the performance characteristics of intermediate-probability&#xD;
      criteria, where overall accuracy is &lt;50% from limited data. Patients in this group are&#xD;
      recommended to a) undergo endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance&#xD;
      cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP), b) undergo cholecystectomy with intra-operative&#xD;
      cholangiography (IOC), or c) proceed directly to ERCP. At centres where EUS and MRCP are&#xD;
      readily available, these are preferred options, as they are least invasive and sensitive;&#xD;
      however, they are often unavailable. Thus, in clinical practice, a high proportion of&#xD;
      intermediate-risk patients ultimately proceed directly to ERCP, where likelihood of benefit&#xD;
      is only moderate, while procedural risk remains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of liver enzyme changes has not been evaluated; however, dynamic changes may offer&#xD;
      another method for evaluating patients at intermediate risk of CBD stones that is safe and&#xD;
      available. Incorporation of dynamic liver enzymes may improve the test-performance&#xD;
      characteristics of the existing framework.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two planned phases for this proposed study. The first will be a retrospective phase&#xD;
      aimed at assessing the test performance characteristics of the current guideline-based&#xD;
      criteria, and subsequently with developing a novel with the incorporation of dynamic liver&#xD;
      enzyme changes into the intermediate-probability CBD stone management algorithm. In the&#xD;
      second phase, we will evaluate and prospectively validate the proposed model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Retrospective Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a retrospective study of patients evaluated for suspected choledocholithiasis.&#xD;
      Given the nature of our tertiary care facility as outlined above, this will constitute a&#xD;
      population-based study of a sample of 1,000 patients from 2012-2017 who underwent evaluation&#xD;
      for choledocholithiasis. The selection of 2012 as the start of our study period is based on&#xD;
      an appropriate time lag from publication to widespread clinical adoption of the ASGE&#xD;
      guidelines, which were published in 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An institutional endoscopy database and reporting platform (Endopro, Pentax) has been used in&#xD;
      Calgary since 2000, and it is estimated that well over 95% of all ERCP and EUS procedures&#xD;
      have been reported using Endopro since its implementation. We will employ several strategies&#xD;
      to capture patients. We will initially search our Endopro database for all ERCPs and EUS&#xD;
      exams performed where the indication was &quot;suspected choledocholithiasis&quot; of any probability.&#xD;
      This broad search strategy will identify all possible choledocholithiasis cases. Potential&#xD;
      cases will then be grouped by patient name and ordered by data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the potential cases are gathered, and the appropriate sample of 1,000 extracted, a&#xD;
      manual review of each of the endoscopy reports will be performed, in addition to a review of&#xD;
      the patients' medical records through Sunrise Clinical Manager, by one of two independent&#xD;
      medical reviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient baseline demographics (age, gender), co-morbidities and medications will be recorded.&#xD;
      In addition, available laboratory parameters will be recorded for the 7 days preceding the&#xD;
      procedure, allowing for the assessment of trends. Any relevant diagnostic imaging tests&#xD;
      performed in the preceding 60 days will also be captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive diagnosis of choledocholithiasis will be defined as the presence of stone(s),&#xD;
      sludge, debris or microlithiasis on a definitive study (ERCP or IOC). Where our proposed&#xD;
      study will differ from previous studies with similar designs is that we will also incorporate&#xD;
      a follow-up period, where a negative diagnosis of choledocholithiasis will require that a&#xD;
      patient has no readmissions, repeat visits or medical procedures related to&#xD;
      choledocholithiasis within 6 months of the initial period of clinical suspicion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the above extracted data, we will be able to determine the performance characteristics&#xD;
      of relevant parameters in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis, in addition to assessing the&#xD;
      utility of dynamic enzyme trends. New framework(s) and/or novel criteria will then be&#xD;
      developed using the findings, that select the optimal blend of test characteristics both for&#xD;
      ruling in and ruling out choledocholithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Prospective Validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel algorithm developed in Phase 1 will then be applied in a prospective fashion, when&#xD;
      possible, to consecutive patients undergoing EUS or ERCP for suspected choledocholithiasis.&#xD;
      The same variables will be measured as in Phase 1, but in Phase 2, a research assistant (RA)&#xD;
      will prospectively enter data and follow up with patients. The sequence of procedures will be&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient is referred to PLC Endoscopy Unit for consideration of ERCP or EUS&#xD;
           procedure, and is booked by the attending advanced/therapeutic endoscopist on call as&#xD;
           appropriate, as per the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients referred to this service are either a) outpatients or b) inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Outpatients will be ineligible for the study as per our defined exclusion criteria&#xD;
                in Section 3.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Inpatients, once verbal and written consent to approach has been given to their&#xD;
                admitting nurse, will be approached by the RA prior to their procedure to discuss&#xD;
                the actively enrolling study, and to answer any potential questions. Inpatients&#xD;
                with suspected or proven cholangitis will be excluded since it is generally agreed&#xD;
                that these patients should proceed directly to ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the patient agrees to participate, the relevant informed database/study consent&#xD;
           form(s) is/are signed and witnessed. If the patient decides not to participate, the ERCP&#xD;
           or EUS proceeds as per the usual standard of care (and the sequence that follows does&#xD;
           not apply).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The RA collects any relevant patient-related and pre-procedural data through combination&#xD;
           of direct patient interview and subsequent review of the medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patient is then met by the endoscopist performing the procedure to discuss the risks&#xD;
           and benefits of the procedure and have the patient sign informed consent for the&#xD;
           procedure.The patient enters the endoscopy/fluoroscopy room and the procedure commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. During the procedure, relevant peri-procedural data are recorded by the RA by direct&#xD;
           observation, and/or, if necessary, in consultation with the procedural physician(s)&#xD;
           and/or nurse(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After the procedure is complete, the patient is moved to the recovery room for&#xD;
           observation. Depending on their disposition and the course of the procedure, observation&#xD;
           times and protocols differ. During this stage, the RA collects any relevant&#xD;
           post-procedural data, and any missing pre- or peri-procedural data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Any peri- or immediate post-procedural adverse event is recorded prospectively in the&#xD;
           database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The patient is examined by the endoscopist prior to discharge and provided with written&#xD;
           post-procedure information, including a phone number to call in the event of any issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The RA meets with the patient prior to their discharge from the unit to answer any final&#xD;
           potential questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Any formal histology or cytopathology results from the procedure are recorded in the&#xD;
           database by the RA as they become available.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Patients are contacted by the RA by telephone 30 days following their procedure to&#xD;
           assess ongoing symptoms and advise of any adverse events, including emergency department&#xD;
           visits or inpatient admissions. If any are endorsed, the details are captured&#xD;
           electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. The patient medical record is reviewed 6 months following their procedure to assess for&#xD;
           any adverse events, including emergency department visits, inpatient admissions, repeat&#xD;
           procedures or surgeries related to a possible diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. The&#xD;
           details are captured electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Any potential study outcomes will then be analyzed and presented in manuscript form, and&#xD;
           submitted to peer reviewed journals for eventual publication as well as to conferences&#xD;
           for dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. All participants will be mailed a letter outlining the results of any relevant studies,&#xD;
           and thanking them for their involvement.&#xD;
