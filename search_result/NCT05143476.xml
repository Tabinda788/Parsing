  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To define a serum protein-based diagnostic for the progression and failure of fracture&#xD;
      healing, through the identification of a set of serum proteins that appear at early times of&#xD;
      biological healing and show a specific correlation with later radiological and functional&#xD;
      signs used to define delayed healing and non-union.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Aim 1 Learning Set: At the earliest time in the study when 10 non-unions have been&#xD;
      identified, we will select 10 control patients matched for comorbidities (including a body&#xD;
      mass index&gt;40, smoking history, and diabetes) from the group that has been enrolled for&#xD;
      comparison to the 10 non-union patients. The proteins showing the most substantial changes in&#xD;
      response to either their initial or end point measurements in both healer and non-healer sets&#xD;
      will be identified. Temporal clustering and biological assessment tools will be used to&#xD;
      identify the biological processes and time frames showing altered serum levels for these&#xD;
      markers. A selection process will then use a set of pair wise iterative processes to identify&#xD;
      both single markers and multiple marker subsets that show the best correlations to both mRUST&#xD;
      and union/nonunion diagnosis prior to the current time that the diagnosis for failed healing&#xD;
      is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim2 Validation Set: As soon as the next group 10 non-union patients are identified a new&#xD;
      group of 10 healers will be selected and the target group of protein identified in phase one&#xD;
      will be tested for robustness in a second study with this new set of non-healers healers.&#xD;
      Assessments of the robustness will be based on level of detection (LOD) and reproducibility&#xD;
      of LOD and diagnostic performance. A third assessment will be carried out with the total&#xD;
      group of 20 non healers identified in both the first and second phases of the project by&#xD;
      rescreening this group against profiles of a final and novel set of 40 new healers. This new&#xD;
      set of healers will be selected from the total patient sets of profiles that have been&#xD;
      collected across the entire study period and again will be randomly selected and matched for&#xD;
      comorbidities. During each subsequent screen we will refine the marker set further taking&#xD;
      into account both performance features, qualitative factors related to a protein's biological&#xD;
      functions and relationships to the processes of healing, and their correlation to the&#xD;
      clinical parameters that we are using to assess progression of healing (union). The last&#xD;
      stage of assessment provides an independent technical biochemical/immunological validation&#xD;
      for the ten best performing proteins. This assessment will be made using a conventional&#xD;
      Western blot assay across a randomized set of 20 profiles from both healers and non-healers&#xD;
      who had been previously screened using the microarray format. This last assay is a quality&#xD;
      control step for protein identification specification.&#xD;

    <description>The analysis will include proteins with significant changes over time. The main analysis will focus on examining associations with protein clusters, using mean protein levels averaged over proteins within the same cluster. Secondary analysis will explore individual proteins separately or in clusters via multi-level modelling; however, the latter approach (multi-level modeling will be more of exploratory due to modelling complexity and large sample requirement.</description>

      Each 50mL specimen will be divided into 40 mL of whole blood which will be fixed for storage&#xD;
      and 10 mL which will be collected for plasma processing. Plasma samples will be used for&#xD;
      analysis of up to ~2000 proteins found in plasma circulation in the blood during the learning&#xD;
      phase (Aim1). During the validation phase (Aim2) a more restricted target group of 170&#xD;
      proteins will be assayed. The networks of interaction among various multiple inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators, systemic response factors to trauma and locally produced proteins at the repair&#xD;
      site during callus formation that spill into the serum will be analyzed. Whole blood as fixed&#xD;
      for long term storage will be processed per study operating procedures, for future research&#xD;
      endeavors directed at total blood immune cell profiling.&#xD;

        We will consent and enroll up to 180 patients who meet the enrollment inclusion exclusion&#xD;
        criteria for this study. In this group we anticipate based on our prior clinical data that&#xD;
        about 20 patients would experience failed healing (nonunion) providing us with the ability&#xD;
        to identify those protein in the serum that are diagnostic for failed healing. Patient&#xD;
        enrollment will take place continuously over a three year period with the two stages of the&#xD;
        project initiated when the enrollment numbers are met to carry out each aim of the project.&#xD;
        When a patient presents with a humerus fracture he or she will be evaluated (according to&#xD;
        standard of care) for possible enrollment in the study. The inclusion /exclusion criteria&#xD;
        will be reviewed by the treating surgeon.&#xD;
