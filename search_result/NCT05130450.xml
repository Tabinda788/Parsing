  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of olezarsen (formerly known as&#xD;
      AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx) on the percent change in fasting triglycerides (TG) from baseline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label extension (OLE) study of up to 60 participants with FCS&#xD;
      rolling-over from Study ISIS 678354-CS3 (NCT04568434). Participants will receive olezarsen&#xD;
      during a 53-week treatment period, followed by a 13-week post-treatment follow-up period. The&#xD;
      length of participation in this study is approximately 70 weeks, which includes an up to&#xD;
      31-day qualification period, a 53-week treatment period, and a 13-week post-treatment&#xD;
      evaluation period.&#xD;
