    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if the administration of a short course of&#xD;
      intravenous hydrocortisone, an anti-inflammatory medication, to patients with severe acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis will improve their clinical outcomes and decrease the length of hospitalization.&#xD;
      We think that because inflammation in the body drives the progression of pancreatitis, giving&#xD;
      a short course of intravenous hydrocortisone may mitigate disease progression and improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      intravenous hydrocortisone on clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
      The interventional drug is Hydrocortisone (100 mg of hydrocortisone in 50 milliliters of&#xD;
      saline solution). The placebo is saline and is identical in appearance and volume to the&#xD;
      interventional drug. Study drug will be administered intravenously every 8 hours for 72 hours&#xD;
      as per standard clinical procedures by nursing staff. The patient's sequential organ failure&#xD;
      assessment score (SOFA) will be assessed for changes over time. Blood will be drawn at&#xD;
      several time points to assess biomarkers over time.&#xD;
