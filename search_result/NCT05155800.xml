      The study population will consist of 3 mutually-exclusive sets of patients and subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TBI patients with intracranial bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TBI patients without intracranial bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control subjects with normal brain health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research subjects between the ages of 22 to 50 will be enrolled. All TBI patients must have a&#xD;
      diagnostic head CT scan within 24 hours of the injury. TBI patients without intracranial&#xD;
      bleeding based on the CT scan must have a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at enrollment of ≤&#xD;
      14. Total maximum duration of active monitoring with the device in this study is 48 hours&#xD;
      with a clinical follow-up at day 7 after enrollment.&#xD;
