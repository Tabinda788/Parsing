  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SSPE is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder occurring after measles infection and is&#xD;
      potentially life-threatening.Measles infection remains endemic in Pakistan especially in the&#xD;
      lower socioeconomic population where the vaccine coverage is low. The ketogenic diet has been&#xD;
      used in a large number of diseases especially intractable epilepsies in children and also in&#xD;
      certain neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's in adults. Some of the&#xD;
      case reports from India and the USA have reported the beneficial results of ketogenic&#xD;
      diet(KD) not only in the control of myoclonic jerks of SSPE but also in stopping and&#xD;
      reversing the progress of the disease. There is a definite need to conduct a multi-center&#xD;
      trial of KD to establish its effectiveness in SSPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Aga khan university, the investigators have an experienced team who have been using KD&#xD;
      for the last 9 years for intractable epilepsy. At AKU the investigators currently have 4&#xD;
      patients on board for the past 4 months, with diagnosed SSPE on Low Glycemic Index Diet and&#xD;
      showing some improvement in their seizure and motor control. Based on these reports, for a&#xD;
      poor measles control country like Pakistan, there is a need to work further in order to&#xD;
      establish evidence for KD therapy as a treatment for SSPE. The findings of the proposed study&#xD;
      will serve as a hope for the improvement of quality of life of patients suffering from SSPE&#xD;
      which is a devastating disease with almost 100% mortality .&#xD;

      Methodology This will be a bi-center trial. The national institute of child health (NICH)&#xD;
      will be a partner in this study along with Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. This study&#xD;
      will be a nutritional research study looking at the role of the Ketogenic diet in improving&#xD;
      seizures and overall disability in children with SSPE. LGIT will be the form of KD used for&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All families with children who have been newly diagnosed with confirmed SSPE will be&#xD;
      approached to start the low glycemic index diet,(liberalized kind of KD). They will be&#xD;
      counseled on the disease and the diet regimen. all possible side effects and management will&#xD;
      be discussed. The duration of follow-up will be for one year and there will be no potential&#xD;
      cost incurred by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be followed up by the physiotherapist at the physiotherapy department at&#xD;
      AKU ( @ no cost)who will be supporting their motor rehabilitation. Investigations which&#xD;
      include blood work and echo and ultrasound and EEGs will be done at regular intervals&#xD;
      Sampling technique A consecutive sampling of all children who are diagnosed with SSPE will be&#xD;
      used. A total of 26 children &gt;2-&lt;15 years will be enrolled over a period of two years.&#xD;

0.I don't know&#xD;
Responsibility:This domain has its own 5 point scale:&#xD;
Adult/caregiver has full responsibility;&#xD;
Adult/caregiver has most responsibility and child takes a little responsibility&#xD;
Adult/caregiver and child share responsibility about equally&#xD;
Child has most responsibility with a little direction, supervision or guidance from an adult/caregiver&#xD;
Child takes full responsibility without any direction, supervision or guidance from an adult/caregiver Two types of score will calculate: normative scores and scaled scores. The normative score is based on the child's chronological age. Scaled score provides a way to look at current functional skills and progress in skills over times (compare the child towards itself).</description>

Dead GMFM There is a scoring system with each item scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, or &quot;not tested&quot;. A scoring key of 0 - does not initiate, 1 - initiates, 2 - partially completes, and 3 - completed, is used; however parameters such as distance, time, support provided, accuracy, counts, and tasks will determine specific item scores. Items that a child refuses to attempt despite reason they may be able to perform at least partially or items not administered are scored as 'not tested'.&#xD;
The scoring system of the GMFM is a four-point scale that consists of 66 items divided into five dimensions of gross motor function:(a) lying and rolling, (b) sitting, (c) crawling and kneeling, (d) standing, and (e) walking, running and jumping.</description>

These patients are usually already admitted in the hospital for initial diagnosis and management. Therefore the initiation of the diet will be in the hospital during their admission if the parents/ caregivers agrees. A minimum of 2-3 days would be required to train the parents/caregivers.</description>
