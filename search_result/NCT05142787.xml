      The purpose of this study is to provide prospective evidence that the Magseed Pro® marker&#xD;
      /Sentimag® Gen3 system is safe and effective for marking A. suspicious/biopsy-proven positive&#xD;
      axillary lymph nodes; and B. soft tissue lesions including cancer and pre-cancerous change in&#xD;
      the breast The devices used in this clinical trial are the Magseed Pro® marker and Sentimag®&#xD;
      Gen3 system by Endomagnetics Limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Endomag Magseed Pro® Marker System is intended to be placed within the target soft tissue&#xD;
      prior to planned surgical removal. The marker, when used in conjunction with the Sentimag®&#xD;
      Gen 3 System, can be used as a guide for the surgeon to follow in the excision of tissue. The&#xD;
      Sentimag® Gen3 Magnetic Localisation System when used with the Magseed family of markers is&#xD;
      indicated to assist in localising soft tissue lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a multicentre international prospective, open label, study of Magseed&#xD;
      Pro® marker and Sentimag® Gen3 system in patients with breast and/or lymph node pathology&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. axillary lymph nodes requiring localisation prior to surgical excision (suspicious and/or&#xD;
      biopsy proven lymph node or other pathology indicating removal) and/or B. breast lesions&#xD;
      requiring localisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have the Magseed Pro® marker placed to mark A. surgical excision of&#xD;
      suspicious/biopsy-proven axillary lymph node as part of a targeted lymph node biopsy&#xD;
      procedure AND/OR B. breast lesions in patients undergoing surgical excision of the targeted&#xD;
      breast lesion The Magseed Pro® marker will be localised using the Sentimag® Gen3 system and&#xD;
      therafter surgically removed with the target tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol 224 patients; 112 with Magseed Pro® marker placed to mark breast&#xD;
      lesions and 112 with Magseed Pro® marker placed to mark nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of enrolment is approximately 9 months across all sites with each&#xD;
      individual subject's participation lasting approximately 1-38 weeks after enrolment.&#xD;
