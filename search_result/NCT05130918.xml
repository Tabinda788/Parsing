  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center, prospective, randomized, open label, phase-III study, patients with&#xD;
      indication to Thulium Laser Enucleation of Prostate were enrolled. The report conformed to&#xD;
      CONSORT 2010 guidelines. Eligible patients were 1:1 randomized. Randomization defined Group&#xD;
      A: patients who were administered Phenolmicin P3 and Bosexil suppositories twice a day for 5&#xD;
      days, then once a day for other 10 days; Group B: patients who did not receive the&#xD;
      suppositories (&quot;controls&quot;). Study endpoints were evaluated at 15 and 30 days postoperation.&#xD;
      Primary endpoint included evaluation of effects of the suppository on irritative symptoms by&#xD;
      administering International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) with Quality of Life (QoL)&#xD;
      questionnaire. Secondary endpoint included evaluation of effects on urinary tract infections&#xD;
      by performance of urinalysis with urine culture.&#xD;

    <description>The suppository we herein investigated includes different active principles, namely: Bosexil®, that is a vegetal extract derived from the resin of the Boswellia serrata, a plant native to India. It has already been published that the Boswellic acids contained show anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in a variety of inflammatory diseases whose physio-pathological pathways are shared with those of prostatitis; phenolmicin P3 is a polyphenolic extract derived from beehive propolis, that also demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in preclinical reports. It has also been reported to have the ability to create a microenvironment hostile to the reproduction of pathogenic bacteria.</description>
