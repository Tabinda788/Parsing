      This is a randomized, controlled, pragmatic trial designed as a &quot;type I hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial&quot; that tests a hypertension program integrating a virtual&#xD;
      Collaborative Care Clinic (vCCC), home blood pressure monitoring, and telehealth for lowering&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) in two health systems.&#xD;

      This study tests a hypertension program integrating a virtual Collaborative Care Clinic&#xD;
      (vCCC), home blood pressure monitoring, and telehealth for lowering blood pressure (BP) in&#xD;
      two health systems (University of Kansas Health System [UKHS] and the University of Utah&#xD;
      Health [UUtah]). The vCCC is staffed by clinical pharmacists who remotely monitor home BP and&#xD;
      use telehealth to work with patients to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to &lt;130 mmHg, as&#xD;
      recommended by the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association&#xD;
      (ACC/AHA) guidelines. Eligible patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) are identified&#xD;
      automatically through the electronic health record (EHR) during visits to their Primary Care&#xD;
      Provider (PCP) and referred for enrollment into the vCCC.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Control At 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome is achieving SBP control (&lt;130 mmHg). Blood pressure measures will be collected in a dashboard system and will be integrated into the common data model table for final analysis. Investigators will utilize the Benjamini-Hochberg approach to control for multiple testing in our primary outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use composite z score obtained by averaging standardized z scores of individual NP test scores and use z scores of individual tests to determine changes in a single test that may be obscured with the measurement of a global score. The tests are Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Blind, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Number Span Forwards and Backwards (NSFB), Oral Trail Making Test (OTMT), Category Fluency, Verbal Fluency, Rey Auditory Verbal Naming Test Delayed Recall and Recognition, and Verbal Naming Test (VNT). MoCA Blind has 22 possible points, with19 or above normal. NSFB gives 2 scores, total number of correct trials and longest sequence repeated correctly with higher score indicating better working memory. The category fluency has 2 possible scores with a higher number of unique names indicating a better semantic memory. For the Verbal Fluency test the score reflects the number of unique responses with a higher score indicating better memory</description>

    <measure>Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be extracted. MACE will be identified by will be identified by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for hospitalization due to myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, and heart failure, which will be identified by combining observations from EHR</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk (ASCVD)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data from the EHR will be extracted. (ASCVD) score will be estimated by age, sex, race, BP, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, history of diabetes, smoking status, HTN treatment, statin and aspirin therapy. ASCVD score is given as a percentage. A 0 to 4.9% risk is considered low risk, 5 to 7.4% is considered borderline, a 7.5 to 20% risk is considered intermediate, and a score above 20% is considered high.</description>
