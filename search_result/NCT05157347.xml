  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is reported as one of leading causes of adult disability. Recent advances in in&#xD;
      revascularization therapy have had a significant impact on clinical and functional outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with ischemic stroke. However, revascularization therapy can only be applied to a&#xD;
      limited population of patients. Many stroke survivors are still suffering from significant&#xD;
      motor impairments and gait disturbance. The recovery of the ambulatory function in stroke&#xD;
      patients is one of the most important goals of their rehabilitation and a critical factor&#xD;
      influencing the patient's home and social activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most frequently occurring disabilities in stroke patients is the ambulatory&#xD;
      impairment. Ambulation is a key factor in performing the activities of daily living. About&#xD;
      80% of stroke patients showed the ambulatory impairment in acute stroke phase, and many&#xD;
      stroke patients were not fully regain the ambulatory function although the ambulatory&#xD;
      function was rapidly restored within 6 months after onset. Because the ambulatory function is&#xD;
      the most important relating factor on activities of daily living and quality of life, one of&#xD;
      the most important goals of stroke rehabilitation can be the achievement of independent gait.&#xD;
      The conventional gait rehabilitation has been performed as a 1:1 training session between the&#xD;
      therapist and a stroke patient. This gait rehabilitation can make a significant burden on the&#xD;
      therapist and restriction of the rehabilitation time. The limited number of rehabilitation&#xD;
      facilities and therapists for the number of stroke patients requiring rehabilitation means&#xD;
      that many stroke patients might receive not enough gait rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these issues, a lot of studies have been conducted to develop rehabilitation&#xD;
      robots for effective gait training. Nonetheless, in previous studies regarding robot-assisted&#xD;
      gait rehabilitation, the stroke patients varied in terms of their baseline gait ability,&#xD;
      functional level, and onset of stroke. In addition, robots for gait rehabilitation robots&#xD;
      were various such as exoskeletal, end effector and overground gait types with varied&#xD;
      frequency, duration and intensity of the gait rehabilitation training. Such heterogeneity&#xD;
      inevitably limited the quality of the studies as well as the application in clinical&#xD;
      practice. For an adequate robot-assisted gait rehabilitation in clinical practice, the&#xD;
      functional level and the phase of stroke patients should be taken into consideration. In&#xD;
      addition, for the gait rehabilitation robots to be applied effectively, it also should be&#xD;
      considered to have a defined indication as well as a protocol including frequency, duration&#xD;
      and intensity of robot-assisted gait rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A robot could have efficiency in assisting patients to practice correct and repetitive&#xD;
      movements with the adequate quantity and intensity of training. The robot-assisted gait&#xD;
      rehabilitation using a treadmill-based robot for location control has increased in stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation. However, the conditions of treadmill gait differ from those of actual&#xD;
      overground gait so that the increase in gait ability after treadmill-based training might not&#xD;
      directly translate into the improvement of overground gait. In addition, a drawback of such&#xD;
      gait training using a robot for location control could be the difficulty in adapting the&#xD;
      robotic movements to the patient's efforts to move the muscles and to the passive&#xD;
      characteristics of the musculoskeletal system. On the contrary, overground gait training has&#xD;
      been reported to improve the gait speed and endurance to a greater degree than treadmill gait&#xD;
      training in stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, overground gait training using an exoskeletal wearable robot has been proposed to&#xD;
      promote the activation of the nervous system by inducing an active participation from the&#xD;
      patient who performed active balance control, weight shift, and muscle activation. In the&#xD;
      previous study, the effect of gait training using an exoskeletal robot was reported in&#xD;
      patients with incomplete paraplegia caused by spinal cord injury. Nevertheless, lack of&#xD;
      studies have reported on the effect of gait training using an exoskeletal wearable robot in&#xD;
      subacute stroke patients.&#xD;
