  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PROMISE (Pediatric Radiation Oncology with Movie Induced Sedation Effect) is an interactive&#xD;
      incentive-based movie system that integrates with a video surveillance gating module&#xD;
      (VisionRT) as an alternative sedation solution for pediatric patients undergoing radiation&#xD;
      treatment (RT). This single-arm, open label, single-center phase II clinical trial is to&#xD;
      implement PROMISE for all children ages 3-11 who are planned to undergo RT at the&#xD;
      institution. The primary goal is to decrease the total number of pediatric patients who&#xD;
      require general anesthesia through the use of PROMISE, with secondary goals being to assess&#xD;
      the impact that PROMISE has on patient/family anxiety and quality of life, treatment time and&#xD;
      clinical efficiency, and overall cost. The investigators hypothesize that PROMISE will lead&#xD;
      to a reduction in the percentage of patients ages 3-7 who require general anesthesia use from&#xD;
      70% (historical control) to 30%.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy (RT) requires precise immobilization in order to accurately deliver a&#xD;
      conformal dose to the target(s) while avoiding nearby organs at risk. In children, RT&#xD;
      frequently requires daily anesthesia use during the entire course of treatment, often up to&#xD;
      4-6 weeks total. While the data varies, ~40-50% of children, and the majority of those under&#xD;
      the age of 7, require daily general anesthesia. Anesthesia can have significant short- and&#xD;
      long-term detrimental effects on patient health, including increased risk of hypoxia,&#xD;
      allergic reactions, hyperthermia, vascular access device complications (20-25%), and&#xD;
      neurocognitive impairment. Furthermore, daily anesthesia provides significant logistical and&#xD;
      financial burden, with the average 6-week course of daily anesthesia for RT being&#xD;
      approximately $50,000 in payer charges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric Radiation Oncology with Movie Induced Sedation Effect (PROMISE) is an interactive,&#xD;
      incentive-based movie system that integrates with a video surveillance gating module&#xD;
      (VisionRT) to help keep a children's attention and prevent children from moving during&#xD;
      radiation treatment. While audiovisual distraction techniques have previously been described,&#xD;
      PROMISE is the first system that allows for real time monitoring of patient motion and&#xD;
      automatic shutting off of the beam and video if the patient moves outside of defined&#xD;
      parameters. This not only provides a built-in safety mechanism, but also allows for real time&#xD;
      behavior training that incentives patients to not move.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose implementing PROMISE for all children between ages 3-11 undergoing&#xD;
      radiation treatment through a phase II clinical trial with the following workflow: 1) During&#xD;
      the CT simulation scan, a training session will be conducted, where the child will learn to&#xD;
      lie still with positive and negative feedbacks provided by the system for behavioral&#xD;
      training. This session will also be used as a screening test to choose children suitable for&#xD;
      PROMISE. Only children meeting the movement-requirements during the training session will be&#xD;
      selected as candidates for the following non-sedated radiation treatment. 2) During the&#xD;
      treatment, a child will watch an age-appropriate movie or video of participant/s choice. A 3D&#xD;
      surface imaging system will be used to monitor the motion of the child. If the motion exceeds&#xD;
      any pre-defined positioning thresholds (e.g., conventional radiotherapy (CRT): 0.5 cm in&#xD;
      translation movements and 2° in three rotational angles; stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT):&#xD;
      0.15 cm and 0.5 degree), the treatment beam will be shut off and the movie will be paused. 3)&#xD;
      Beyond threshold movements the child will be instructed with the effectiveness of movement&#xD;
      control strategy. 4) If the child reverts to treatment position within a pre-defined temporal&#xD;
      threshold (e.g. 1 minute), the treatment will be resumed with a continuing movie. 5) If the&#xD;
      child cannot revert to the treatment position within a pre-defined time threshold/or the&#xD;
      movement is beyond any pre-defined re-alignment threshold value (e.g., 1 cm / 5° in three&#xD;
      rotational angles), the radiation beam and the movie will be turned off, the patient will be&#xD;
      readjusted and the treatment will resume. 6) In any treatment fraction, PROMISE treatment&#xD;
      will be ceased if therapists have to re-position the child multiple times. If the child is&#xD;
      consecutively noncompliant with PROMISE treatments for two fractions, participant will&#xD;
      receive radiotherapy treatment with general anesthesia in the all subsequent fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to decrease the total number of pediatric patients who require&#xD;
      general anesthesia through the use of PROMISE. The secondary objectives are to assess the&#xD;
      impact that PROMISE has on patient/family anxiety and quality of life, treatment time and&#xD;
      clinical efficiency, and overall cost, and to determine the average patient movement and beam&#xD;
      stoppages with PROMISE. Patient/family-reported health quality of life will be assessed using&#xD;
      PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module and patient anxiety will be measured by the modified Yale&#xD;
      Preoperative Anxiety Survey Short Form (mYPAS-SF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesize is that PROMISE will lead to a reduction in the percentage of patients ages&#xD;
      3-7 who require general anesthesia use from 70% (historical control) to 30%. Using a&#xD;
      two-sided exact binomial test with a significance level of 0.05 and power=80%, a sample size&#xD;
      of 13 patients (ages 3-7) will be needed to detect this difference. In the investigator's&#xD;
      past experience, ~42% of children ages 3-11 (eligibility criteria) are between 3-7 years old,&#xD;
      so 30 children total will be needed to enroll 13 who are between 3-7 years old.&#xD;
