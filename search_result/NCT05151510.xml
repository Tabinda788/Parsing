  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy of trigger point injections with 1%&#xD;
      lidocaine in reducing myofascial back and neck pain in the Emergency Department compared to&#xD;
      lidocaine patches 5%.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and the potential risks and benefits, all patients will&#xD;
      be randomized into either the trigger point injection group with 1% lidocaine, or the 5%&#xD;
      lidocaine patch group. Pain scores will be recorded while in the emergency department, and we&#xD;
      will have a 5 day follow-up phone call to assess efficacy. Patients who present to UCI&#xD;
      Department of Emergency medicine will be screened and recruited prospectively, and&#xD;
      information regarding this study will be available on clinicaltrials.gov as a method of&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a single-center, prospective, randomized, pragmatic trial carried out with patients that have a primary complaint of myofascial back and/or posterior neck pain. Upon presentation to the emergency department, if the patient is found to have myofascial pain, they will be approached by research personnel to be enrolled in the study. If the patient consents to be in the study, the patient will then be randomly assigned to either receive a trigger point injection or receive lidocaine patch (5%) therapy. The lidocaine patch therapy group cannot receive a trigger point injection. Randomization will occur in blocks of 2, using a Web- based randomization program (http://sealedenvelope.com).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Given the trigger point injection is physician performed, and very different from placing a lidocaine patch, we cannot blind investigators nor the patient to the intervention. We will, however, blind our outcome assessors in regards to which intervention the patient had received.</masking_description>

    <description>The physician will withdraw 1cc of 1% lidocaine in a 25g needle, sterilely prep the field with a Chloraprep applicator, use index, and middle finger to squeeze the borders of the trigger point and raise the central aspect of the trigger point, insert the needle at 90-degree angle up to 5/8' deep, inject 1cc of the 1% lidocaine after ensuring needle is not in a blood vessel, removing the needle, and then covering the insertion site with a sterile bandage.</description>

&#xD;
          -  18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with myofascial pain of the posterior neck or back. *The diagnosis of&#xD;
             myofascial pain was based on established criteria of having a palpable taut band&#xD;
             (trigger point) that when depressed reproduced the patient's pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  midline spinal tenderness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evidence of radiculopathy&#xD;
