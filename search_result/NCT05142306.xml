  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that COVID-HIG in all three routes of administration (intramuscular [IM],&#xD;
      subcutaneous [SC], and intravenous [IV]) is well-tolerated and that concentrations of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be measurable over time, with derived pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      parameters in line with immunoglobulin product class kinetics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, two-center, open-label, randomized study to evaluate one dose level&#xD;
      of COVID-HIG administered IM or SC for safety and PK in healthy adults compared to COVID-HIG&#xD;
      administered intravenously. Approximately 36 adult participants will be targeted to be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Enrollment into the study will be staggered, wherein no more than&#xD;
      three participants will be randomized and dosed on the first day with at least one hour&#xD;
      between dosing of each participant. On the second day, up to two more subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized and dosed. The remaining participants will be randomized and dosed, with no more&#xD;
      than 5 participants dosed per day. Safety data will be reviewed by a Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (SMC) (consisting of at least three independent external members) after all 12&#xD;
      participants in Cohort 1 have completed at least 72 hours of safety follow-up. An overall&#xD;
      decision by the SMC will be made whether to proceed with full randomization (1:1:1) and&#xD;
      dosing of the remaining study participants (Cohort 2, n=24). Participants will be stratified&#xD;
      based on their SARS-CoV-2 antibody status (positive/negative) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment and administration of study treatments may be paused by the PI or medical&#xD;
      monitor for safety review by the SMC if any of the following occur after study product&#xD;
      administration and during the enrollment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One or more serious adverse event(s) [SAE(s)].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three or more of the same Grade 3 adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three or more Grade 2 hypersensitivity AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any participants become positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study follow-up period, they&#xD;
      will be assessed using an Ordinal Outcome Scale until they complete their last follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Participants who test positive for SARS-CoV- 2 will be excluded from PK analyses.&#xD;
