  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) refers to the abnormal glucose metabolism first detected&#xD;
      during pregnancy. It is estimated that approximately 7% of pregnant women worldwide and their&#xD;
      offspring are affected by GDM. The incidence of GDM in China is as high as 18.9%. A number of&#xD;
      studies have shown that GDM complicates 3%-25% of pregnancies and poses serious health and&#xD;
      life threats to the mother and child. In fact, due to the lack of physical activity during&#xD;
      pregnancy and the decrease of insulin sensitivity compared with non-pregnancy, the optimal&#xD;
      time for intervention has long been lost until the diagnosis of GDM in the second trimester.&#xD;
      However, it is a pity that no authoritative screening method for GDM in early pregnancy has&#xD;
      been established, and the pathogenesis of GDM is still unclear. Our study intend to search&#xD;
      for biomarkers used for screening of GDM in early pregnancy and explore the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      GDM, so as to provide new ideas for prevention measures and treatment targets of GDM.&#xD;
