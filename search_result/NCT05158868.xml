      To study the risk of hypoxia in placenta of normal pregnant women infected with covid-19&#xD;
      during third trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxaemia is an ominous sign of COVID-19, and it is usually an indicator of disease&#xD;
      severity. An oxygen saturation above 90% is associated with better outcomes. Hypoxia&#xD;
      indicates an imbalance of oxygen delivery to tissues and leads to compromised function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are considered master regulators of oxygen homeostasis&#xD;
      and are oxygen level sensitive. HIF1a is a heterodimeric transcription factor that bind to&#xD;
      hypoxia response elements, which participates through the regulation of the expression of&#xD;
      several genes in numerous cellular events such as O2 sensing, glucose metabolism, lipid&#xD;
      metabolism, angiogenesis and other aspects of endothelial biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIGF is a proangiogenic protein and member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#xD;
      family. It is one of the key molecules in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis especially during&#xD;
      embryogenesis and placental trophoblast is the main source of PIGF throughout the gestational&#xD;
      period of pregnancy. It shares structural as well as amino acid sequence similarity with&#xD;
      VEGF, but PIGF has binding afﬁnity only for VEGF receptor1(VEGFR-1). The inter-and&#xD;
      intramolecular cross-talk between the VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 is regulated by PIGF. It binds&#xD;
      toVEGFR-1 and displaces VEGF from this receptor, which results in activation and&#xD;
      intermolecular trans phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 thereby amplify the VEGF-induced&#xD;
      angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxic environment is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of cytotrophoblast&#xD;
      for maintenance of materno-fetal circulation at early periods of pregnancy. But its&#xD;
      prevalence in later stages of pregnancy causes several complications that may lead to&#xD;
      maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several researchers have proved that the overexpression of HIF-1α is associated with the&#xD;
      increased maternal serum concentration of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) during&#xD;
      hypoxic conditions. High circulating levels of sFlt1 exerts an antiangiogenic state that is&#xD;
      associated with low levels of proangiogenic factors, such as PIGF, and inhibition of PIGF&#xD;
      with its receptor VEGFR-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no information regarding the expression of HIF-1a in normal pregnant&#xD;
      women with COVID-19 infection and its potential involvement in the placentation of this&#xD;
      condition. Therefore, in the present work we will detect the expression of hypoxia induced&#xD;
      factor 1a (HIF1a) and possible molecular link between the expression of HIF-1α and PIGF based&#xD;
      on previous studies which show significant negative association between HIF-1α and PIGF&#xD;
      expression in patients suffering from preeclampsia.&#xD;
