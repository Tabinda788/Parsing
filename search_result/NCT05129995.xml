  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Aging is accompanied by impairments in the sensitivity of skeletal muscle tissue&#xD;
      to respond to the anabolic properties of protein feeding, which is suggested to result in&#xD;
      age-related loss in muscle mass. Adequate muscle perfusion capacity is essential for muscle&#xD;
      mass maintenance, as it determines the rapid delivery of amino acids, nutrients and growth&#xD;
      factors to the muscle fiber, thereby stimulating muscle protein synthesis. However, muscle&#xD;
      perfusion capacity declines with increasing age. Hence, improving muscle perfusion may be key&#xD;
      to augment the sensitivity of senescent muscle following protein feeding in older adults.&#xD;
      Although exercise training is an effective way to improve muscle perfusion capacity, there&#xD;
      are a number of patient groups that find exercise training difficult to achieve. Hence,&#xD;
      alternative strategies need to be developed to improve muscle perfusion capacity. Passive&#xD;
      heat treatment (PHT) has been associated with various health benefits in older adult&#xD;
      populations, including improved blood pressure, cardiovascular disease risk, and metabolic&#xD;
      health. In addition, PHT has been shown to increase muscle fiber capillarization in healthy&#xD;
      young adults. However, whether such an intervention improves muscle perfusion capacity, and&#xD;
      enhances the anabolic response of skeletal muscle following food ingestion in older adults is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the impact of an 8-week passive heat treatment intervention on skeletal&#xD;
      muscle fiber capillarization/perfusion capacity and post-prandial muscle protein synthesis&#xD;
      rates in healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: single arm, within subject study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 14 healthy older (65-85 y) men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Participants will be subjected to an 8-week (3 x pw) PHT, by&#xD;
      means of infrared sauna bathing, intervention. Before and after the PHT intervention the&#xD;
      participants will undergo one test day during which blood pressure, body composition,&#xD;
      physical function and muscle strength will be assessed. In addition, before and after the PHT&#xD;
      intervention period subjects will be complete a 'whole-meal test day' during which the muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis and perfusion capacity response will be evaluated following the ingestion&#xD;
      of a whole food meal. Basal and post-prandial muscle protein synthesis and perfusion capacity&#xD;
      will be assessed by a continuous infusion of labelled amino acids combined with&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound measurements. Blood and muscle samples will be collected in&#xD;
      order to assess the muscle protein synthetic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome will be post-prandial muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis rates following meal ingestion.&#xD;
