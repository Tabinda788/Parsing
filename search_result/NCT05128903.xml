  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      QARIN 1 is a study of [18F]DPA-714 Translocation Protein (TSPO) Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
      (PET) for longitudinal, quantitative assessment of brain neuroinflammation following whole&#xD;
      brain radiation therapy. This TSPO PET, uses a radioactive tracer. An optional MRI (magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging) will also be performed to monitor brain microstructure damages induced by&#xD;
      neuroinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of temporal and regional variability of uptake of translocator protein (TSPO)&#xD;
           positron emission tomography (PET) tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regional variability will be assessed in medial temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and in&#xD;
           white matter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temporal variability will be assessed by scanning each subject four-times: at baseline&#xD;
           (before or within 2 weeks of start of radiation therapy), before start of chemotherapy,&#xD;
           at 1 year from the initiation of the radiation therapy, and at 1.5-2 years from the&#xD;
           initiation of the radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of radiation dose in specific brain regions with radiation induced&#xD;
           neuroinflammation as measured by uptake of TSPO PET tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of radiation-induced brain microstructure injuries (RIBMI) in specific brain&#xD;
           regions (medial temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and in white matter) using advanced&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association of radiation dose with MRI measures of RIBMI in these specific brain&#xD;
           regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association of PET measures of RIN with MRI measures of RIBMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association of PET measure of RIN and MRI measures of RIBMI in specific regions of&#xD;
           interest (ROI) with specific domain of neuro-cognition. For example, to investigate&#xD;
           whether PET measure of RIN and MRI measures of RIBMI in hippocampal ROI have strongest&#xD;
           association with episodic memory; whether frontal lobe cortical ROI are associated with&#xD;
           attention and executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association of a novel MRI based technique for assessment of RIN with TSPO PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association of the PET and MRI measure of neuroinflammation within 2- years of&#xD;
           completion of radiation with delayed cognitive outcome that will be measured at 3, 4 and&#xD;
           5 years from the completion of radiation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participant will have 4 PET scans using a novel PET tracer that will help the&#xD;
      investigators to quantify when and where in brain neuroinflammation happens following&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The participant will receive the first PET scan either before your first&#xD;
      dose of radiation therapy or within 2 weeks of the start of radiation therapy. The second PET&#xD;
      scan will be obtained before starting chemotherapy. The third scan will be after 1 year of&#xD;
      treatment.The final scan will be 1 and a half to 2 years after the start of treatment.The&#xD;
      scan process will begin an hour or so after the participant has been given tracer by&#xD;
      injection. The entire PET scan process lasts about 2 hours.&#xD;
