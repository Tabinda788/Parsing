  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the effectiveness of a novel&#xD;
      personalized approach to the surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children,&#xD;
      drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) directed surgery versus the standard adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
      (AT). This will also serve to test the feasibility of recruiting families for a future&#xD;
      randomized protocol comparing the same surgical techniques. It is the investigators' central&#xD;
      hypothesis that a personalized DISE-directed surgical approach that uses existing procedures&#xD;
      to address the specific fixed and dynamic anatomic features causing obstruction (ie, anatomic&#xD;
      endotypes) in each child with small tonsils or Down syndrome will be superior to the&#xD;
      currently recommended standard first line approach of AT. This novel approach may improve OSA&#xD;
      outcomes and reduce the burden of unnecessary AT or secondary surgery for persistent OSA&#xD;
      after an ineffective AT. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will study children aged&#xD;
      2 to 18 years with clinically small tonsils (Brodsky score 1+ or 2+ on a scale 1+ to 4+) OR&#xD;
      Down syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined as repetitive obstruction of the upper airway during&#xD;
      sleep and has been estimated to affect 1-6% of the general pediatric population. Untreated&#xD;
      OSA in children has been associated with childhood hypertension, autonomic dysfunction,&#xD;
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, neurobehavioral impairment, and poor quality of&#xD;
      life. These sequelae contribute to a 226% increase in health care utilization among children&#xD;
      with OSA compared to controls, primarily in the form of increased hospitalizations, emergency&#xD;
      department visits, and medication use. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is considered the most&#xD;
      common risk factor for OSA in children, and adenotonsillectomy (AT) is the first line&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although AT is the recommended first line treatment for pediatric OSA in treatment&#xD;
      guidelines, multiple studies have demonstrated that AT is not always curative, with estimates&#xD;
      of persistent OSA after AT ranging from 25 to 75%. Many risk factors for AT failure have been&#xD;
      reported, but the impact of tonsil size on AT outcome remains a controversial topic. Not&#xD;
      every child with enlarged tonsils will have OSA, and conversely, there are many children with&#xD;
      proven OSA who do not have clinically large tonsils or adenoids. The prevalence of small&#xD;
      tonsils (1+ or 2+ on Brodsky tonsil scoring scale of 1+ to 4+) has been reported to be 67-70%&#xD;
      among children with symptoms of OSA presenting to either the emergency department or a&#xD;
      pediatric pulmonology clinic. Clinic assessment of tonsil size during an awake examination&#xD;
      has not consistently correlated with either baseline disease severity or response to AT. The&#xD;
      outcome of AT in children with small tonsils (Brodsky 1+ or 2+) remains unknown and clinical&#xD;
      decisions in children with small tonsils are not evidence-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Down Syndrome have a higher incidence of OSA than the general pediatric&#xD;
      population, with rates of 30-60%, resulting in increased morbidity and decreased quality of&#xD;
      life for affected individuals. Children with Down Syndrome often undergo T&amp;A for obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea; however 30-50% will have persistent obstructive sleep patterns requiring&#xD;
      continuous positive pressure airway support (CPAP) or tracheotomy. Persistent obstruction is&#xD;
      attributed to anatomic and physiologic differences in this population, including reduced&#xD;
      muscular tone, macroglossia, maxillary hypoplasia, and lingual tonsil hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) enables direct observation of the sites and patterns of&#xD;
      obstruction during sedated sleep. DISE increasingly helps guide surgical decision-making in&#xD;
      adult OSA, and the investigators hypothesize DISE can guide surgical decisions in pediatric&#xD;
      OSA and improve outcomes. Towards that end, the study team has developed and validated the&#xD;
      DISE Rating Scale in children. Furthermore, the investigators have demonstrated DISE ratings&#xD;
      of adenotonsillar obstruction during sedated sleep are strongly associated with both OSA&#xD;
      severity and response to AT, unlike clinic assessments of tonsil size. This preliminary data&#xD;
      and others' studies have identified non-adenotonsillar obstruction can also occur at the&#xD;
      nose, palate, base of tongue, and larynx. DISE findings in surgically naïve children and the&#xD;
      outcomes of procedures based on those findings have been reported in mostly small&#xD;
      observational case series. The surgical plan may be modified from the standard AT in up to&#xD;
      77% of children based on DISE findings. These alternative procedures can be less invasive&#xD;
      (e.g., only isolated adenoidectomy or isolated tonsillectomy) or include procedures to&#xD;
      address other anatomic sites in addition to or instead of the tonsils and adenoids. The most&#xD;
      commonly reported non-adenotonsillar sites of obstruction are the nose, velopharynx (soft&#xD;
      palate), tongue base, and the larynx. DISE-directed surgery at these sites may improve&#xD;
      pediatric OSA outcomes, but existing studies are small, uncontrolled case series in&#xD;
      heterogeneous study populations. There are no trials directly comparing AT and DISE-directed&#xD;
      surgery in the common scenario of surgically naïve children with small tonsils. This study&#xD;
      will inform a future randomized trial that has the potential to change the paradigm of&#xD;
      treating OSA in children with small tonsils or Down syndrome, thereby improving outcomes, and&#xD;
      reducing inappropriate AT and need for secondary sleep surgery.&#xD;

    <description>DISE will be performed by the surgeon performing the surgical intervention. The DISE Rating Scale assesses the degree of maximal closure or obstruction at six locations in the upper airway: the nose, nasopharynx (adenoids), velopharynx (soft palate), oropharynx (tonsils), tongue base (tongue, lingual tonsils), and larynx (epiglottis, arytenoids). The degree of obstruction is scored on a 3-point rating scale as none (0), partial (+1), or complete (+2) at each anatomic site. The rating at each anatomic level can be summed into a DISE Rating Scale total. The actual surgery performed will determine which established surgical treatments will be used based on the results of the DISE.</description>
