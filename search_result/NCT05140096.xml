    <textblock>
      This is a 2-period study. On Day 1 of Period 1, all participants will be randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment sequences and will receive a single oral dose of 100 mg acalabrutinib (Treatment&#xD;
      A). In Period 2, the participants who participated in Period 1 will receive either Treatment&#xD;
      B (fluconazole) or Treatment C (isavuconazole). In Period 2 Treatment B, participants will&#xD;
      receive a single oral loading dose of 400 mg fluconazole on Day 1 one hour before a single&#xD;
      oral dose of 100 mg acalabrutinib. In Period 2 Treatment C, participants will receive oral&#xD;
      dose of 200 mg isavuconazole three times daily (TID; approximately 8 hours apart) on Day 1&#xD;
      and 200 mg isavuconazole once daily (QD) from Day 2 to Day 5 with a single oral dose of 100&#xD;
      mg acalabrutinib coadministered on Day 5. There will be a washout of at least 8 days between&#xD;
      Period 1 and first dose in Period 2. All participants will return to the study site&#xD;
      approximately 7 days after the last study drug for follow-up procedures and adverse event.&#xD;
