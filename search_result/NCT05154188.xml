  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On June 23, 2021, the Oticon Medical Neuro Cochlear Implant System (NCIS) was granted&#xD;
      premarket approval (PMA) in the US to treat individuals 18 years or older, with bilateral&#xD;
      severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss, who obtain limited benefit from appropriately&#xD;
      fitted hearing aid(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help assure the continued safety and effectiveness of an approved device, a post-approval&#xD;
      study was required as a condition of approval under 21 CFR 814.82(a)(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide longer-term data on the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the Neuro Cochlear Implant System under general conditions of use in the postmarket&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The post-approval study will be an open-label, prospective, multi-center, single-arm,&#xD;
      non-randomized, self-controlled clinical trial in 10 clinical sites in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide longer-term data on the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the Neuro Cochlear Implant System under general conditions of use in the postmarket&#xD;
      environment. This study will be conducted as a prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized&#xD;
      study in 10 clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 subjects, newly treated will be enrolled. Study subjects will be followed for 3&#xD;
      years post implantation of the device with a target follow-up rate of 80% at the end of the&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is the comparison of the type and frequency of adverse events and&#xD;
      serious adverse events observed during the study period. The effectiveness endpoints will&#xD;
      include the within-subject differences for sentence recognition as evaluated with the AzBio&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include the following visits: baseline, 1-month post-surgery (activation&#xD;
      date), 3 months, 6-months, 12-months, 18-months, 24-months, and 36-months post-activation.&#xD;
      Each participant will serve as their own control with baseline measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total estimated duration of the study is 60 months: 24 months of recruitment and 36&#xD;
      months of subject participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first patient is expected to be included within 6 months of study approval (obtained on&#xD;
      August 19, 2021).&#xD;
