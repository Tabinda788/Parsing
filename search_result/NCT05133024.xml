  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the BEET IT study is to examine if preoperative intake of beetroot juice can&#xD;
      ameliorate gastrointestinal (GI) recovery after colorectal surgery and thereby help to reduce&#xD;
      the duration of postoperative ileus (POI). Adult patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal&#xD;
      surgery are randomized 1:1 to consume either concentrated beetroot juice (active&#xD;
      intervention) or nitrate-depleted concentrated beetroot juice (placebo) during the week&#xD;
      before their surgery. Blood, tissue and/or fecal samples are collected at specific time&#xD;
      points pre- and/or postoperatively to study markers related to inflammation, oxidative stress&#xD;
      and GI function. Patients are followed from the week before their surgery (start of the&#xD;
      intervention) until 3 months post-surgery. The study takes place at 5 hospitals in Flanders,&#xD;
      Belgium.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI), a transient impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) motility, remains&#xD;
      one of the most common complications following abdominal surgery. It is characterized by the&#xD;
      presence of nausea and vomiting, the inability to tolerate oral diet, abdominal distension&#xD;
      and delayed passage of flatus and stool. POI usually resolves within 3 to 5 days, but when&#xD;
      prolonged, it can lead to increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization and increased&#xD;
      healthcare costs. In patients undergoing colorectal surgery, the reported incidence of&#xD;
      prolonged POI (PPOI) is 10.2%. Prevention and treatment remains mainly supportive and no&#xD;
      single effective treatment is currently available. Because of its multifactorial origin and&#xD;
      possible exogenous factors, prevention and treatment generally requires a multimodal&#xD;
      approach. Many of these strategies are part of the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS)&#xD;
      program. The pathophysiology of POI is marked by an acute neurogenic phase followed by a&#xD;
      prolonged inflammatory phase and alterations in the enteric neurotransmission. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis involves inflammation and oxidative stress, similar to ischemia/reperfusion&#xD;
      (I/R) injury. Both I/R injury and POI are associated with downregulation of nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      synthases. In this sense, beetroot juice holds considerable promise. Beetroot is a rich&#xD;
      source of inorganic nitrate. Consumption of nitrate-rich foods increases the concentration of&#xD;
      NO metabolites in the blood and tissues via the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway,&#xD;
      independently of the traditional pathway via the endogenous NOS enzymes, which tends to&#xD;
      become less effective in older age and in environments wherein oxygen availability is limited&#xD;
      such as during hypoxia and I/R injury. Interest goes to the effects of preoperative beetroot&#xD;
      juice supplementation on postoperative GI recovery and POI duration after laparoscopic&#xD;
      colorectal surgery. This was recently evaluated via a proof of concept study with 12 patients&#xD;
      at our lab with promising results. We now want to validate the results in a bigger group of&#xD;
      patients via a multicentric double-blind randomized controlled prospective phase II study.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Beetroot juice bottles are delivered at the central investigational site in labeled boxes indicating whether they are active or control juice. The bottles themselves are identical in appearance and only distinguishable by the manufacturer through the production code. Blinding of the juices is done by an independent party who is responsible for removing the labels, indicating whether the juices are active or nitrate-depleted juice, from the boxes, and assigning an intervention letter code to active or control beetroot juice as 'A' or 'B', without revealing which is which. Sets of 7 bottles, corresponding with the dosage regimen, from A or B according to the randomization list made by an independent statistician, are then labelled with an unique randomization letter code comprising of 2 randomly generated letters, followed by an underscore and a numerical index from 1 to 7 (e.g. AX_1,â€¦, AX_7), to assure allocation concealment.</masking_description>
