  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Integrative Medicine is an approach to health that addresses a person's mental, physical,&#xD;
      social, spiritual, and environmental factors. Chronic diseases are best treated if the root&#xD;
      cause is addressed, improving one's overall health. Health is defined by the WHO as &quot;a state&#xD;
      of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease or&#xD;
      infirmity.&quot; Many national institutions, such as the American Heart Association, American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology, American Diabetes Association, and more, all affirm that lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications are the number one treatment and prevention for the most common disorders: high&#xD;
      blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, etc. The generic term &quot;lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications&quot; encompasses many aspects that can be impacted by Integrative Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients present to be treated by Integrative Medicine practitioners frequently, and we would&#xD;
      like to see how their quality of life is improving by being treated by this practice&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At the turn of the 19th century, medicine made great strides in the field of bacteriology.&#xD;
      Development of antibiotics, pasteurization, sterilization and antiseptic techniques led to&#xD;
      tremendous advances in the understanding of disease pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, with increased longevity came increased rates of chronic diseases, a shift&#xD;
      referred to as the &quot;epidemiological transition.&quot; Lifestyle risk factors have been directly&#xD;
      linked to the increase in diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke - with these&#xD;
      conditions overtaking infectious diseases such as TB, influenza, cholera, and pneumonia as&#xD;
      the major sources of mortality in the developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These major external or modifiable factors contributing to US mortality were subsequently&#xD;
      labeled the &quot;actual causes of death&quot; and included tobacco usage, physical inactivity, diet,&#xD;
      alcohol, sexual behaviors, and others (McGinnis, 1993). This same analysis has persisted into&#xD;
      the 21st century. An analysis by Mokdad published in JAMA, 2004 found that tobacco, poor&#xD;
      diet, physical inactivity and alcohol use were the leading causes of death, collectively&#xD;
      accounting for 36.8% of all deaths in 2000. In 2014, chronic diseases remain the leading&#xD;
      cause of mortality and morbidity in the US and the main contributors to these diseases are&#xD;
      tobacco use, poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol use, hypertension and hyperlipidemia -&#xD;
      all modifiable risk factors. As medical research shifted toward addressing these chronic&#xD;
      health conditions linked to lifestyle risk factors, the clinical practice of medicine shifted&#xD;
      to a disease-oriented model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the core of Integrative Medicine, physicia strive to delineate factors that have caused a&#xD;
      person to be who they are at this current stage, all the way from when they were in utero&#xD;
      until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrative Medicine is a practice approach to medicine that strives to achieve health, the&#xD;
      definition of health being a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not&#xD;
      merely the absence of disease or infirmity, as defined by the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Andrew Weil Center of Integrative Medicine has the following principals at the core of&#xD;
      its practice: the patient and practitioner are partners in the healing process; all factors&#xD;
      that influence health, wellness and disease are taken into consideration, including mind,&#xD;
      spirit and community, as well as the body. Appropriate use of both conventional and&#xD;
      alternative methods facilitates the body's innate healing response. Effective interventions&#xD;
      that are natural and less invasive should be used whenever possible; the broader concepts of&#xD;
      health promotion and prevention of illness are paramount.&#xD;
