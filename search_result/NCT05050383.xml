    <textblock>
      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) represents an opportunity to evaluate the upper airway in&#xD;
      sleep-like conditions. In its current clinical form, however, DISE does not routinely&#xD;
      determine the functional impact of anatomic and neuromuscular factors on airflow obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will apply nasal pressure (CPAP) during DISE to generate pressure-flow and&#xD;
      pressure-area relationships, deriving functional determinants of upper airway obstruction&#xD;
      during sleep. In addition, they will use objective anatomic measurements from computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) and submental ultrasound. The findings will allow the investigators to&#xD;
      streamline the upper airway exam during DISE, and will further the goal of developing&#xD;
      personalized solutions that address specific pathogenic mechanisms of pharyngeal collapse and&#xD;
      airflow obstruction during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the physiologic and anatomic features derived from DISE and&#xD;
      imaging to determine which are predictive of success to standard-of-care surgical&#xD;
      interventions (e.g. skeletal, soft tissue, neurostimulation) .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction due to&#xD;
      inadequate muscle tone during sleep leading to nocturnal hypercapnia, repeated oxyhemoglobin&#xD;
      desaturations and arousals. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the therapeutic&#xD;
      mainstay for OSA, but adherence remains poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there exist 3 classes of surgical therapy for OSA, each addressing a specific&#xD;
      pathologic structure: skeletal surgery (target: jaw bones), neurostimulation (target:&#xD;
      tongue), and soft tissue (target: soft palate). Unfortunately, there is a critical knowledge&#xD;
      gap in terms of accurately identifying a patient's underlying mechanism of obstruction; as a&#xD;
      result, the efficacy of surgical treatment is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) represents an opportunity to evaluate the upper airway in&#xD;
      sleep-like conditions. In its current clinical form, however, DISE does not routinely&#xD;
      determine the functional impact of anatomic and neuromuscular factors on airflow obstruction.&#xD;
      In June 2020, the investigators implemented a pilot protocol (IRB # 833511) to utilize&#xD;
      measures of airflow, pressure catheters, and ultrasound to enhance DISE exams. Over the&#xD;
      course of 100 patients, they refined the research protocol to generate a safe, efficient, and&#xD;
      comprehensive physiologic exam of the upper airway in the clinical setting (Dedhia et al,&#xD;
      ORL, 2021, in press).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper airway pressure-flow and pressure-area relationships will be characterized during a&#xD;
      standard-of-care DISE by stepping through a range of nasal pressure (CPAP) levels to derive&#xD;
      functional determinants of upper airway obstruction during sleep. The investigators'&#xD;
      preliminary work in this area has shown patients requiring lower pressures to restore airflow&#xD;
      experience improved outcomes with neurostimulation surgery. Their overall hypothesis is that&#xD;
      upper airway pressure-flow/area relationships can be used to predict response to all 3 major&#xD;
      classes of sleep surgery: skeletal, neurostimulation, and soft tissue. They will address this&#xD;
      hypothesis by characterizing upper airway pressure-flow and pressure-area relationships while&#xD;
      utilizing objective anatomic measurements from CT and ultrasound. These findings will allow&#xD;
      investigators to streamline the upper airway exam during DISE, and will further the goal of&#xD;
      developing personalized solutions that address specific pathogenic mechanisms of pharyngeal&#xD;
      collapse and airflow obstruction during sleep.&#xD;
