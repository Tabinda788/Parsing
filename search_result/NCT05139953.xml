  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, caused by SARS-COV-2, was first reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province,&#xD;
      China, at the end of December 2019. The exact origin of human infection has not yet been&#xD;
      clearly identified.SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronavirus family, and other pathogens from&#xD;
      this family have inflicted a range of viral infections, including Middle East Respiratory&#xD;
      Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The incubation period varies&#xD;
      from 2 days to 2 weeks following exposure to the virus.The global pandemic caused by the&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been growing at an&#xD;
      accelerating rate. The increasing mortality rate warrants identification and protection of&#xD;
      the vulnerable populations in society.It is well known that pregnancy-related immune&#xD;
      suppression makes mothers more vulnerable than non-pregnant women to several viral&#xD;
      infections, including SARS-COV, hepatitis E virus, influenza, and herpes simplex virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, changes in pulmonary function during pregnancy, including decreased total lung&#xD;
      capacity and functional residual capacity, may cause susceptibility to viral pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on clinical outcomes of pregnant women suffering from COVID-19 are therefore relatively&#xD;
      scarce. Recently a meta-analysis of 13 publications reported preterm births, neonatal&#xD;
      pneumonia, and respiratory distress syndrome in infants born of COVID-19-positive mothers.&#xD;
      The rates of cesarean deliveries and adverse pregnancy outcomes were substantially higher&#xD;

        All medical records of pregnant women admitted to EL Bagour Quarantine hospital, Menoufia&#xD;
        governorate diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from May, 2020 were revised to collect&#xD;
        maternal and neonatal data using a standardized data collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Information included:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GA&#xD;

          -  Pre-existing medical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presenting symptoms at admission; such as fever, sore throat/ nasal or sinus&#xD;
             congestion, cough/chest pain, vomiting/diarrhea, and fatigue/myalgia, dyspnea….etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The laboratory results at admission and on discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lymphopenia was defined when lymphocytes count less than 1100 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ultrasound report upon admission to the hospital that included; fetal viability,&#xD;
             amniotic fluid index and any placental abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  C.T. Report if done.&#xD;
