  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research was carried out to evaluate the effect of video and accompanying music played&#xD;
      with virtual reality glasses during episiotomy repair on women's perceived pain, vital signs&#xD;
      and postpartum comfort during episiotomy repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a randomized controlled experimental study. The study was conducted on 84&#xD;
      pregnant women, 40 of whom were in the intervention group and 44 were in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals expected to be achieved during the research are; Reducing the perceived pain during&#xD;
      episiotomy repair with video and accompanying music played with virtual reality glasses&#xD;
      during episiotomy repair Video and accompanying music watched with virtual reality glasses&#xD;
      during episiotomy repair increase postpartum comfort The positive effect of video and&#xD;
      accompanying music on vital signs during episiotomy repair with virtual reality glasses&#xD;

      Workgroup implementation steps Informed Voluntary Consent Form and Pregnancy Introductory&#xD;
      Form (the first 8 questions of the pregnant introductory information - labor and episiotomy&#xD;
      follow-up form) will be filled in by the researcher, to the pregnant women who were&#xD;
      randomized daily to the study and control group by going to the clinic during the research.&#xD;
      During the repair of mediolateral episiotomy, the pregnant women included in the study group&#xD;
      will be shown the video accompanying the acemaşîrân makam with sterile virtual reality&#xD;
      glasses with a view of nature. In the literature, it is stated that the video watched with&#xD;
      the acemaşîrân makam and virtual reality glasses reduces pain [6, 7, 21] After the internet&#xD;
      connection is established with a smart phone, the video to be clicked on youtube.com will be&#xD;
      clicked, Relaxation Project 1 (SBS VR) video and Acemaşiran Ayini Şerifi Ney-Bendir will be&#xD;
      selected for the sound, and video and music will be played with virtual reality glasses by&#xD;
      pressing the play button[22, 23] Sound and image will be adjusted as the pregnant woman&#xD;
      wants. During the study, all pregnant women included in the study will be given the same care&#xD;
      and follow-up, apart from watching the video. The video containing nature scenes prepared by&#xD;
      the researcher and the acemaşîrân maqam will be watched from the moment the episiotomy is&#xD;
      opened to the time when the episiotomy is closed. Numerical pain assessment scale will be&#xD;
      applied before, during (during hymen suturing) and 1 hour after the end of mediolateral&#xD;
      episiotomy repair. Postpartum comfort scale 4-24th postpartum. The vital signs of the&#xD;
      pregnant women in the study group will be recorded by the researcher before and during&#xD;
      episiotomy repair (during hymen suturing) and 1 hour after the end of mediolateral episiotomy&#xD;
      repair. In episiotomy repair, the time from the first suture to the last column will be&#xD;
      recorded. The pregnant woman will be asked how long she perceives the duration of episiotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group application steps Unlike the experimental group, only video and music&#xD;
      applications will not be applied to the pregnant women included in the control group. Other&#xD;
      applications will be made in the same way.&#xD;
