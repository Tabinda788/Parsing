  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intraoperative fluid balance during pediatric cardiac surgery is a very sensitive&#xD;
      parameter given the low circulating volume and the complexity of anesthetic management but&#xD;
      might be deleterious if inadequately managed. The hypothesis is that a highly positive&#xD;
      intraoperative fluid balance increases the incidence of adverse events in the short and long&#xD;
      term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective observational study including all consecutive children admitted for cardiac&#xD;
      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) from 2008 to 2018 in a tertiary children's hospital&#xD;
      will be performed. A multivariate analysis will be carried out to study the effect of the&#xD;
      fluid balance on the incidence of adverse events.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Severe postoperative morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>From intervention until 28 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Severe postoperative morbidity will be characterized as the presence of two or more of the following situations: respiratory failure, prolonged inotropic support, or renal failure. Respiratory failure will be defined as the requirement for mechanical ventilation for &gt;82 hours at any time from PICU admission to the time of tracheal extubation.&#xD;
Prolonged inotropic support will be characterized as hemodynamic support by continuous vasoactive drug infusion for &gt;48 hours postoperatively (excluding dopamine or dobutamine ≤5 μg/kg/min). Renal failure will be characterized as the worst estimated postoperative creatinine clearance (eCCr) value showing a ≥75% reduction compared with the preoperative baseline eCCr.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of new Neurological deficits</measure>
    <time_frame>From intervention until 28 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological deficit will be characterized as a transient or permanent functional abnormality in a body region due to a reduction of brain function. The measuremnt will be the incidence of ischemic stroke, hemorragic stroke and cognitive dysfunctions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of newInfections</measure>
    <time_frame>From intervention until 28 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Infection will be characterized as the need for antibiotics other than the usual anti-staphylococcal prophylaxis initiated by the attending intensive care physician for a suspected or proven infection caused by any pathogen or for a clinical syndrome associated with a high probability of infection. Measurment will be the number of patients with new infections corresponding to this definition.</description>
