  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal brings together multidisciplinary teams from four New York City institutions&#xD;
      charged with reducing cancer disparities that affect approximately two million people&#xD;
      residing in some of the most diverse and underserved communities in the United States. The&#xD;
      intent of this collaborative research is captured by its acronym, DISRUPT: Diversity &amp;&#xD;
      IncluSion in Research Underpinning Prevention &amp; Therapy Trials. To disrupt the norms that&#xD;
      maintain heightened risk and poorer outcomes experienced by BIPOC, the research team propose&#xD;
      three integrated and synergistic aims to improve diversity and inclusion in CTs through&#xD;
      disruptive approaches at the community (Aim 1), provider, system and patient (Aim 2), and&#xD;
      basic and translational scientist levels (Aim 3). All three aims focus on metrics for&#xD;
      changing norms reified in institutional policies and established practice that will provide&#xD;
      essential evidence to translate and scale these changes to institutions and networks involved&#xD;
      in cancer treatment research. In Aim 1, the research team will partner with local&#xD;
      organizations to formulate and disseminate new norms regarding cancer care and research and&#xD;
      diffuse these new norms throughout the community via community organizations and Health&#xD;
      Ambassadors bringing a different vantage point on CTs, raising awareness and increasing&#xD;
      demand for access to cancer research. In Aim 2, the research team will create an electronic&#xD;
      approach to identify key clinical characteristics of patients and trials and match patients&#xD;
      and trials and bring these data to patients and their physicians at the time of key&#xD;
      decisions. In Aim 3, the research team will provide and integrate essential experiential&#xD;
      training in diversity, social determinants of health and the importance of conducting&#xD;
      community-relevant work into basic and translational science training. This DISRUPT proposal&#xD;
      provides the foundation to disrupt norms about cancer clinical trials in our communities,&#xD;
      delivery systems and scientific research enterprises.&#xD;
