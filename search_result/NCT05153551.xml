  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to assess a new autism evaluation model that would include the&#xD;
      addition of a Level-2 autism screener, the Rapid Interactive Screening Test for Autism in&#xD;
      Toddlers (RITA-T), to the developmental screening already done by the child's pediatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The PEARS intervention will show high feasibility to primary care physicians (PCPs) and&#xD;
           patient families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The PEARS intervention will lead to increased parent activation around autism diagnosis.&#xD;

    <measure>Change on the Parent Activation Measure for Children with Developmental Disabilities (PAM-DD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(day 1), approximately day 35 (time 5)</time_frame>
    <description>Items are scored using a 4-point a Likert-type scale (1 = disagree strongly to 4 = agree strongly). Raw scores are summed and scaled from 0 to 100 using weighted scores based on Guttman scaling. Higher scores correspond to higher activation. This 13-item measure will be administered verbally to parents at baseline and 3-4 weeks post-RITA-T assessment. Changes from baseline to follow-up will be calculated for each participant.</description>

    <measure>Qualitative data from parents semi-structured interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately day 35 (time 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will analyze transcripts of parent semi-structured interviews to assess general sense of empowerment and motivation, with a focus on novel insights into the experience of parents of children undergoing a Level-2 screening instrument within the medical home.</description>

    <description>The RITA-T is a play-based assessment that involves nine different activities that can be done safely with a child seated in the exam room. After scoring the RITA-T, the PEARS PCP will immediately provide feedback to the parent regarding results and next steps.&#xD;
In addition, parents will complete certain assessments/surveys during the study to evaluate the program.</description>
