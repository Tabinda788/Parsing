  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interest in identifying a biological marker for the early detection of AL is growing.&#xD;
      Such a marker could play a vital role in modern fast-track multimodal protocols, allowing&#xD;
      safe and early discharge of patients after colorectal surgery with a low rate of readmission.&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) has been identified as a valid parameter for detection of&#xD;
      postoperative infectious complications after rectal resection. A serum CRP level greater than&#xD;
      12.4 mg/dL on postoperative day (POD) 4 is considered predictive of septic complications.&#xD;
      According to a recent analysis, the changes in the trajectory of CRP levels might be more&#xD;
      beneficial than a snipped point. Moreover, the trajectory has a negative predictability of up&#xD;
      to 99.3%. Another interesting biomarker is procalcitonin (PCT), the prohormone of calcitonin,&#xD;
      produced by parafollicular C cells in the thyroid. Normally, it has a very low plasma&#xD;
      concentration in healthy individuals (0.01-0.05 ng/mL), and it increases during severe&#xD;
      generalized bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infections, but not in noninfectious inflammatory&#xD;
      reactions. Procalcitonin has been described as an early, sensitive, and specific marker of&#xD;
      sepsis. Moreover, the plasma concentration of PCT has been used as an early predictor of&#xD;
      infection in acute pancreatitis, secondary peritonitis, and infectious complications after&#xD;
      thoracic, esophageal, and cardiac surgeries. In addition, elevated white blood cell (WBC)&#xD;
      count is associated with AL after gastrointestinal surgeries. Therefore, this study was&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the utility of CRP, PCT, and WBC count trajectories, as separate and&#xD;
      combined biomarkers for prediction of AL after colorectal surgery.&#xD;
