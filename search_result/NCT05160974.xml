  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a local, prospective, non-interventional, regulatory post-marketing surveillance&#xD;
      study. Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are initiating Qtern as indicated by&#xD;
      the MFDS will be included. 600 patients are followed up 12 weeks and at least 60 patients of&#xD;
      the 600 patients are followed up 24 weeks. Patients will be treated as part of routine&#xD;
      practice at Korean healthcare centers by accredited physicians. In this study, patients will&#xD;
      receive Qtern as indicated in the locally approved prescribing information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of a post approval commitment, the MFDS has requested a post-marketing surveillance&#xD;
      program to characterize safety in patients who are treated with Qtern for T2DM by physicians&#xD;
      in the normal clinical practice setting. This study is designed to confirm assess the known&#xD;
      safety profile or identify previously unsuspected adverse reactions and to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Qtern under conditions of routine daily medical practice in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis of the proportion of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs) in patients who are treated with Qtern for type 2 diabetes mellitus by physicians in&#xD;
      the normal clinical practice setting over a period of 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow the changes of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hr&#xD;
      post-prandial glucose (PPG-2hr), blood pressure, abdominal circumference and body weight and&#xD;
      self-reported data in this cohort of patients from baseline to completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Qtern in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      based on conducted laboratory test. (Laboratory tests are not mandatory because of the&#xD;
      non-interventional nature of this study)&#xD;
