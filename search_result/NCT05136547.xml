&#xD;
          1. Patients aged ≥16 years at index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with records of receiving high dose ICS or high dose ICS/LABA and diagnosed&#xD;
             as asthma (ICD-10 code: J45 or J46 ) during baseline period. High dose ICS and high&#xD;
             dose ICS/LABA will be defined in the appendices (Table 6-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who had visit histories at least one visit during baseline period, at least&#xD;
             two visits during outcome period and at least one visit after outcome period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who had a total of 12 weeks of OCS prescribed during the baseline period&#xD;
             including the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients diagnosed with selected autoimmune diseases during the baseline period because&#xD;
        OCS is used as a therapeutic agent for these disease. Autoimmune disease will be identified&#xD;
        by following ICD-10 code (M30, M05, M06, L93, M32, K50, K51, K52, N04).&#xD;
