      gestational age (GA), one injection of GBS-NN/NN2 at 26 (±1) weeks GA and one injection of&#xD;
      GBS- NN/NN2 at 30 (±1) weeks GA. Group 2 will receive one injection of GBS-NN/NN2 at 22 (±1)&#xD;
      weeks GA, one injection of GBS-NN/NN2 at 26 (±1) weeks GA and one injection of placebo at 30&#xD;
      (±1) weeks GA.Group 3 will receive one injection of GBS-NN/NN2 at 22 (±1) weeks GA, one&#xD;
      injection of placebo at 26 (±1) weeks GA and one injection of GBS- NN/NN2 at 30 (±1) weeks&#xD;
      GA. Group 4 will receive one injection of GBS-NN/NN2 at 26 (±1) weeks GA. Group 5 will&#xD;
      receive one injection of placebo at 26 (±1) weeks GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend the clinic for assessment visits up to delivery and for a further 3&#xD;
      visits at 28 (±4) days, 90 (±6) days and 180 (±14) days post delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies will be also be assessed at delivery, and 28 (±4) days, 90 (±6) days and 180 (±14)&#xD;
