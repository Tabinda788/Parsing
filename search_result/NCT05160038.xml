      Virtual reality creates interactive, multimodal sensory stimuli that have demonstrated&#xD;
      considerable success in reducing pain. Much research so far has focused on VR's ability to&#xD;
      shift patients' attention away from pain; however, these methods provide only transient&#xD;
      relief through means of distraction and therefore do not offer long-term analgesic&#xD;
      remediation. An alternative and promising approach is to utilize VR as an embodied simulation&#xD;
      technique, where virtual body illusions are employed as tools to improve body perception and&#xD;
      produce potentially more enduring analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disturbances in body perception (i.e., alterations in the way the body is perceived) are&#xD;
      increasingly acknowledged as a pertinent feature of chronic pain, and include aberrations in&#xD;
      perceived shape, size, or color that differ from objective assessment. The degree of body&#xD;
      perception distortion positively correlates with pain, and prior interventions have evinced&#xD;
      that treatments aimed at reducing body perception distortions correspondingly ameliorate&#xD;
      pain. Several recent experimental research studies have demonstrated the analgesic efficacy&#xD;
      of body illusions in a range of pain conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immersive VR multisensory feedback training signifies a promising new avenue for the&#xD;
      potential treatment of chronic pain by supporting the design of targeted virtual environments&#xD;
      to alter (distorted) body perceptions. Various illusions have been described to alter pain&#xD;
      perception; however, they. Have not been directly compared to each other. The multimodal&#xD;
      stimulus control of VR enables physical-to-virtual body transfer illusions, resulting in the&#xD;
      feeling that the virtual body is one's own. These virtual body illusions can modulate body&#xD;
      perception with ease and could therefore be used to alter the perceived properties of pain,&#xD;
      consequently utilizing a virtual avatar to specifically shape interactive processing between&#xD;
      central and peripheral mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With roughly 1 in 5 affected individuals, chronic pain is incredibly widespread on a global&#xD;
      scale. Unfortunately, standard opioidergic treatment does not consistently provide adequate&#xD;
      relief and is often tied to adverse events. As a novel and innovative approach in pain&#xD;
      management, virtual reality (VR) creates interactive, multimodal sensory stimuli that have&#xD;
      demonstrated considerable success in reducing pain. Much research has focused on VR's ability&#xD;
      to shift patients' attention away from pain; however, these methods provide only transient&#xD;
      relief through means of distraction and therefore do not offer long- term analgesic&#xD;
      remediation. A different and promising therapeutic approach is to utilize VR as an embodied&#xD;
      simulation technique, where virtual body illusions can be used to improve body perception and&#xD;
      produce potentially more enduring analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disturbances in body perception (i.e., alterations in the way the body is perceived) are&#xD;
      increasingly acknowledged as a pertinent feature of chronic pain. Compared to healthy&#xD;
      individuals, patients afflicted with chronic pain exhibit alterations in neural areas&#xD;
      involved in body perception. Subjectively, patients with chronic pain report aberrations in&#xD;
      body perception that include alterations in perceived shape, size, or color that differ from&#xD;
      objective assessment (e.g., experiencing painful body parts as enlarged, twisted, or&#xD;
      otherwise distorted. Furthermore, the degree of body perception distortion positively&#xD;
      correlates with pain, where those in more severe pain also report more extensive body&#xD;
      perception disturbances. Interestingly, interventions aimed at reducing body perception&#xD;
      distortion correspondingly ameliorate pain, and several studies have evinced that modulating&#xD;
      body perception with the use of (non-virtual) body illusions (i.e., multisensory modulations&#xD;
      of perceived embodiment) can elicit significant and even sustained analgesia in patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain. Distorted perceptions of the body therefore constitute a promising target for&#xD;
      pain modulation. Recent experimental and clinical research has demonstrated the analgesic&#xD;
      efficacy of body illusions in a range of chronic pain conditions, including (but not limited&#xD;
      to) osteoarthritis (OA), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and neuropathic pain. For&#xD;
      example, illusory stretching of the hands in patients with OA reduced pain by 40%.&#xD;
      Furthermore, pain relief following a single illusion has been shown to persist between&#xD;
      several minutes up 10 weeks, suggesting that multiple sessions of body illusions could reduce&#xD;
      cortical misrepresentation over time and lead to long-term analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immersive VR multisensory feedback training signifies a promising new avenue for potential&#xD;
      future approaches aimed at the management of chronic pain by supporting the design of&#xD;
      targeted virtual environments to alter (distorted) body perceptions. The multimodal stimulus&#xD;
      control of VR enables physical-to-virtual body transfer illusions, resulting in the feeling&#xD;
      that the virtual body is one's own. These virtual body illusions can modulate body perception&#xD;
      with ease and could therefore be used to alter the perceived properties of pain: disturbed&#xD;
      body perception in patients with chronic pain can thereby be improved by adapting the virtual&#xD;
      body in ways that would not be possible with the physical body. The current study can be&#xD;
      classified as risk category A, since it entails only minimal risks and burdens (i.e.,&#xD;
      potential but unlikely transient dizziness and nausea in VR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that virtual reality will reduce pain intensity ratings from&#xD;
      pre- to post-virtual reality session. However, it is expected that virtual body illusions&#xD;
      will lead to stronger analgesia, since the virtual body illusions additionally aim to target&#xD;
      and normalize body perception disturbances that are associated with chronic pain. While&#xD;
      analgesia is expected immediately following the VR distraction in the control group,&#xD;
      cumulative improvements or sustained analgesia, nor any improvements in body perception&#xD;
      disturbances are not expected. Additionally, the investigators therefore also hypothesize&#xD;
      that virtual body illusions, but not virtual distraction, will reduce body perception&#xD;
      disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center project will consist of confirmatory quantitative research conducted on a&#xD;
      national level. The use of virtual reality (i.e., virtual reality as a distraction versus&#xD;
      embodiment modality) will be examined as a modulatory interventional tool for pain management&#xD;
      in different pain conditions, including complex regional pain syndrome, peripheral nerve&#xD;
      injury, and osteoarthritis. To this end, the control condition will consist of the thus far&#xD;
      regularly employed virtual distraction (i.e., a relaxing virtual scene of a wooded area to&#xD;
      distract participants from pain), in which they will be immersed over several sessions,&#xD;
      versus an experimental condition, wherein participants will be able to both choose from&#xD;
      several virtual body illusions to identify which one best reduces their pain and body&#xD;
      perception disturbances, and be immersed in the preferred/chosen virtual body illusion of&#xD;
      choice over several sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of each pain syndromes will be assigned to the experimental or control group in&#xD;
      a sequential counterbalanced manner. Participants will be grouped together according to their&#xD;
      pain condition, and then assigned to the experimental or control group in a sequential&#xD;
      counterbalanced manner to assure that individuals from each pain condition are equally&#xD;
      represented in both groups. No blinding procedures will be necessary, since the control and&#xD;
      experimental groups are clearly discerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A virtual avatar of each gender will be configured to match the gender of the participants. A&#xD;
      visuomotor tracking system will be used to track the movements of participants' arms, which&#xD;
      will match the movements of the virtual body to increase illusory ownership of the virtual&#xD;
      avatar. The Oculus Quest 2 (www.oculus.com) will be used to as an HMD for the virtual&#xD;
      environments, which has 6GB of RAM and 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye. It weighs 503 grams, has a&#xD;
      screen refresh rate of 72 Hz at launch, and uses internal cameras to track the limbs. The&#xD;
      software for both the experimental and control group will be programmed in Unity (Unity&#xD;
      Technologies, San Francisco); a commonly employed software for programming virtual scenarios&#xD;
      (for empirical research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that the aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of virtual&#xD;
      distraction versus virtual embodiment on pain perception, and that while both virtual&#xD;
      distraction and virtual embodiment have demonstrated analgesic efficacy in the past, they&#xD;
      will only be allocated to one of the groups. During the intervention, participants will be&#xD;
      seated in a chair with both arms resting on a table in front of them and will first be&#xD;
      familiarized with the virtual environment. In the virtual scene, they will experience a&#xD;
      matching virtual table which will be located in a relaxing virtual scene matching the virtual&#xD;
      scene of the control condition - i.e., a virtual scene of a forest, as well as a virtual body&#xD;
      seen from a first-person perspective. Participants will be asked to move their arms from side&#xD;
      to side to induce synchronous visuomotor tracking between the virtual and physical body and&#xD;
      therefore induce illusory ownership of the virtual body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first session of virtual body illusions, participants (both experimental and&#xD;
      control groups) will first experiment with the different types of body illusions provided -&#xD;
      i.e., stretching, shrinking, synchronous flashing of the virtual body with the heart rate,&#xD;
      transparency, or blue color modification. The stretching illusion will consist of a normal&#xD;
      arm or hand stretching beyond its physical boundaries, and then shrinking back to its normal&#xD;
      state. In the shrinking illusion, the limb will shrink in size before increasing to a normal&#xD;
      size again. Another illusion will include visual depiction of the heart rate, where the&#xD;
      virtual body part will flash in synchrony with the heartbeat of the participant. The&#xD;
      transparency condition will consist of a limb increasing and decreasing in transparency,&#xD;
      while the color modification will include a limb that can be cooled through changing the&#xD;
      color to blue. This will allow for an individualized approach, wherein participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group can first experiment with and then move forward with the virtual illusion&#xD;
      they perceive to most effectively reduce their pain. Participants in the control group will&#xD;
      also complete these initial virtual body illusions to increase the statistical power to&#xD;
      examine the effectiveness of the different types of virtual body illusions. To minimize&#xD;
      carry-over effects, the different types of virtual body illusions will be presented in a&#xD;
      counterbalanced manner. Each illusion will be presented for 45 seconds, which falls in line&#xD;
      with previous research using body illusions for chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each illusion, a pain-intensity numeric rating scale (NRS) will appear with the&#xD;
      written instruction asking participants to judge the intensity of their pain on a scale&#xD;
      ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Each virtual body illusion will be&#xD;
      presented three times, and after each illusion, another pain-intensity NRS will appear asking&#xD;
      participants to rate their pain. Additionally, following each type of body illusion,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to rate the degree of embodiment of the virtual avatar and their&#xD;
      own body (embodiment questionnaire - long version: 1. How strongly did the participant feel&#xD;
      that they were present in the virtual environment? 2. How much did the participant feel like&#xD;
      the virtual arm is their own arm? 3. How strongly does it feel like the movements of the&#xD;
      virtual arm are the participant's own movements? 4. How much does the participant feel like&#xD;
      the virtual arm is a different person? 5. How much a part of their body does the&#xD;
      participant's affected physical body part feel? 6. How aware is the participant of the&#xD;
      physical position of their physical limb? 7. How much attention is the participant currently&#xD;
      paying to their physical limb? 8. How strong are the emotional feelings that they have about&#xD;
      their limb? Questions 5-8 are adapted from the Bath CRPS Body Perception Disturbance Scale.&#xD;
      All questions will be answered on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 'not at all' to 'very&#xD;
      much', except for question 8, which will be answered from 'very negative' to 'very&#xD;
      positive'). Participants will be given a two-minute break between each different type of&#xD;
      virtual body illusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants have chosen the virtual body illusion that most strongly reduces their&#xD;
      pain intensity NRS, or the one they feel most comfortable with, they will be given a 15&#xD;
      minute break. Following the break, participants will begin the first session with their&#xD;
      chosen virtual body illusion. The virtual body illusions will be presented in blocks, with&#xD;
      one block consisting of 3 x 45 second virtual body illusion sessions. Between the 45 second&#xD;
      virtual body illusions of each block, there will be a 10 second break from the body illusion.&#xD;
      Prior to the first and following each block, participants will rate their pain on the pain&#xD;
      intensity NRS. In total, participants will complete five blocks of virtual body illusions,&#xD;
      with a 2 minute break between each block. After completion of all five blocks, participants&#xD;
      will again complete the embodiment questionnaire, after which the HMD will be removed. In&#xD;
      total, participants will spend about 20 minutes in virtual reality during the five blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will similarly be familiarized with the HMD and virtual&#xD;
      reality, and will also complete the baseline in which they will experience the same virtual&#xD;
      body illusions as the experimental group, and report their pain intensity NRS. Following the&#xD;
      VR intro session, they will also be given a 15 minute break. Participants in the control&#xD;
      group will not continue with virtual body illusions; instead, they will only be exposed to&#xD;
      the relaxing virtual scene with no body shown, which will be identical between the control&#xD;
      and experimental group. Participants will answer the pain-intensity NRS at comparable time&#xD;
      intervals to the experimental group, therefore similarly completing one pre pain-intensity&#xD;
      NRS prior to beginning the virtual reality distraction session, and 5 &quot;post&quot; pain-intensity&#xD;
      NRS. Therefore, participants in the control condition will spend a similar amount of time&#xD;
      (approximately 20 minutes) in virtual reality. Similarly, they will also complete an&#xD;
      embodiment questionnaire, except a shorter version that will not include questions 2-4 of the&#xD;
      embodiment questionnaire - longer version, and instead will only assess the body perceptions&#xD;
      of their physical bodies (embodiment questionnaire - short version: 1. How strongly did the&#xD;
      participant feel that they were present in the virtual environment? 2. How much a part of&#xD;
      their body does their affected physical body part feel? 3. How aware is the participant of&#xD;
      the physical position of their physical limb? 4. How much attention is the participant&#xD;
      currently paying to their physical limb? 5. How strong are the emotional feelings that they&#xD;
      have about their limb?).&#xD;
