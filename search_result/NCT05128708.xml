    <textblock>
      Right sided hemicolectomy is the standard type of operation for cancers in the caecum, the&#xD;
      ascending colon, proximal transverse colon.The aim of this study was to assess the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of combined medial and caudal approach in performing right hemicolectomy and to&#xD;
      compare outcome between laparoscopic and open surgery in right colon cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing. Slight shift towards right colon cancer is&#xD;
      noticed in the last 2 decades in Egypt. This can be attributed to advances in diagnostic&#xD;
      tools and increased public health awareness as right sided colon cancer was almost presented&#xD;
      late as most of tumors located in the capacious cecum. Hence, early diagnosis with good&#xD;
      radical procedure offers better outcome, quality of life and survival. Many approaches for&#xD;
      right colon resection were described. In this study we adopted the combined medial and caudal&#xD;
      approach for right colon resection in cases of right colon cancer in both open and&#xD;
      laparoscopic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, approach to right colon cancer is through open exploration but this approach&#xD;
      has more blood loss, prolonged postoperative hospital stay, sever postoperative pain and&#xD;
      delayed recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As combined medial and caudal approach is a radical procedure,the purpose of the present&#xD;
      study was to compare between laparoscopic and open right hemicolectomy both done with&#xD;
      combined medial and caudal approach in right colon cancer as regards technical feasibility,&#xD;
      advantages and disadvantages of both procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was prospective randomized study and was carried out on 26 participants as number of&#xD;
      cases with right hemicolon cancer is about 2 per month in our center. Those participants&#xD;
      diagnosed as operable right sided colon cancer and the participants were divided into two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: Open combined medial and caudal right hemicolectomy included 13 participants Group&#xD;
      II: Laparoscopic combined medial and caudal right hemicolectomy included 13 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with inclusion criteria were subjected to preoperative assessment in the form&#xD;
      of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigation (Complete blood picture, liver function tests, blood sugar,&#xD;
           blood urea, serum creatinine, prothrombin time, serum albumin and tumour marker CEA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging (chest X-ray, US abdomen, CT abdomen and pelvis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathology diagnosis (endoscopic biopsy, tissue diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determined whether participants underwent open or laparoscopic operation is&#xD;
           multifactorial e.g., patients desire, contraindications for laparoscopy and mass size if&#xD;
           more than 5 cm preferred to have open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed written consent taken from the patients or the legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      operative technique: both groups offered combined medial and caudal approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting for 6 hours with no oral intake or only clear fluids intake the day before or&#xD;
           better bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After confirming the availability of blood of matching blood group, general anesthesia&#xD;
           is inducted and prophylactic antibiotics are given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient positioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. group I: (Open cases) The standard position for an open right hemicolectomy is&#xD;
                supine with strapping of the ankle and wrists, such as the Trendelenburg position.&#xD;
                The surgeon stands on the patient's left, and the first assistant stands across&#xD;
                from the surgeon on the patient's right. The scrub nurse stands beside the surgeon.&#xD;
                If a second assistant is needed, he or she usually stands across from the surgeon&#xD;
                to the left of the first assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. group II: laparoscopic cases: The patient should be placed in the supine position&#xD;
                with his two legs apart and arms tucked beside the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon should stand between the patient's legs with the assistant standing on the&#xD;
      patient's left and the camera operator standing on the assistant's left side, and the scrub&#xD;
      nurse on the patient's right side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video monitor is placed on the patient's upper right.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal access and trocar placement by open or closed technique using veress needle&#xD;
           for pneumoperitoneum with an intraperitoneal pressure of 14 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedure requires 5 trocars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 10 mm trocar is placed 3 cm below umbilicus for the 30Â° angled telescope to get an&#xD;
           adequate view. The incision would be enlarged to extract the specimen and performing&#xD;
           anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A12 mm trocar is introduced 5 cm below the telescope port for the surgeon right hand&#xD;
           instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 5 mm port is inserted at the McBurney's point for the surgeon's left hand instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional two 5 mm trocars are placed at the opposite of McBurney's point and the right&#xD;
           subcostal position respectively for the assistant to retract and display the colon and&#xD;
           mesocolon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, all patients will be assessed for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      post operatively: Postoperative medications given. Monitoring of vital signs and drains. post&#xD;
      operative assesment of pain is subjective to the participant as he gave it a score from 1 to&#xD;
      10. minimal pain score(1 to 3), mild (4 to 6) and sever (7 to 10). Ambulation and clear oral&#xD;
      fluids started when intestinal sounds are audible followed by soft diet. The intraperitoneal&#xD;
      tube drain removed when there is less than 50cc of fluid per 24h or after performing&#xD;
      ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are reviewed as outpatients weekly for 1 month or more frequent if they develop&#xD;
      any complications between their visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative pathological results, number of lymph node dissection, postoperative&#xD;
      exhaust time, postoperative abdominal drain volume and duration, postoperative short term&#xD;
      complications, hospital stay and postoperative pathological staging will be recorded.&#xD;
