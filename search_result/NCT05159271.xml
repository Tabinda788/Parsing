      This study is designed as a multicentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled with&#xD;
      two-arm parallel groups clinical trial. 144 subjects presenting with early symptoms of common&#xD;
      cold will be recruited for this study, according to the defined inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Azéol Spray Nasal&#xD;
      (Bifidobacterium breve LA 708, extract of cypres Cupressus sempervirens L., extract of&#xD;
      Leguminosae Glycyrrhiza glabra L., glycerin and mannitol), taken two times a day, versus&#xD;
      placebo on nasal congestion in subject with common cold.&#xD;
