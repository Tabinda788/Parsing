      The aim of this study is to advance understanding of behavioural risk factors for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in Singapore.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND: Modifiable risk factors for non-communicable diseases, including unhealthy diets&#xD;
      and movement behaviours, are influenced by complex and dynamic interactions between people&#xD;
      and their social and physical environment. Therefore, understanding patterns and determinants&#xD;
      of these risk factors as they occur in real-life is essential to enable the design of&#xD;
      precision public health interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS: The aims of this study are to (1) examine patterns of dietary and movement behaviours&#xD;
      in real-time as people go about their daily lives, (2) examine how interactions with the&#xD;
      social and physical environment influence dietary and movement behaviours, and (3) examine&#xD;
      how these patterns differ by ethnicity and other socio-demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: This is an observational study in free-living participants over 10 consecutive days,&#xD;
      with a 9-day follow-up 6 months later. 1500 participants will be recruited from a large&#xD;
      prospective cohort study. Real-time data capture strategies will be used: an ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA) app with global positioning system (GPS) enabled to collect&#xD;
      location data, accelerometers to measure movement, and wearable sensors to monitor blood&#xD;
      glucose levels. Participants receive six EMA prompts per day to capture information on diet&#xD;
      and movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep), and related&#xD;
      contextual factors. A second wave of EMA prompts and GPS monitoring will occur 6 months&#xD;
      later. Data will be integrated and analysed using generalised linear models to examine&#xD;
      associations between behavioural risk factors and contextual determinants.&#xD;
