      This study aims to establish a safe and well tolerated dose of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin, etoposide, and tislelizumab in induction treatment and with&#xD;
      tislelizumab in maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed patients with Extensive Stage Small&#xD;
      Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC).&#xD;

      The study for each participant consists of a Screening period, a Treatment period that&#xD;
      includes an Induction treatment period and a Maintenance treatment period, and a Follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period of up to 28 days before starting SCLC treatment, each participant&#xD;
      will be assessed for somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression by [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE imaging&#xD;
      PET/scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 to 6 participants to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four cycles of carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5 on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2&#xD;
           on Day 1-3, every 3 weeks at Weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10 in induction period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tislelizumab 200 mg on Day 1 every 3 weeks in induction and maintenance period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two administrations of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE during the induction period: on either Day 3,&#xD;
           4 or 5 of Week 1 and on Week 7 Day 3 period followed by 1 to 4 administrations during&#xD;
           the maintenance period on Week 13 Day 1, Week 16 Day 1, Week 19 Day 1 and Week 22 Day 1,&#xD;
           depending on the dose assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to six different dose level combinations of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE will be assessed in the&#xD;
      study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 1 (DL1): 100 mCi of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the induction period and 100 mCi&#xD;
           of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the maintenance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 2a (DL2a): 150 mCi of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in both the induction and the&#xD;
           maintenance periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 2b (DL2b): 150 mCi of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the induction period and 200 mCi&#xD;
           of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the maintenance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 3a (DL3a): 200 mCi of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in both the induction and&#xD;
           maintenance periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 3b (DL3b): 200 mCi of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the induction period and 250 mCi&#xD;
           of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the maintenance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 4 (DL4): 250 mCi of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in both the induction and maintenance&#xD;
           periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with&#xD;
      each [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE dose for renal protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation part in this study will be guided by the dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      rate observed within the first 6 weeks (42 days) of treatment. In addition to DLTs the&#xD;
      totality of safety data available at the time will be assessed for each dose escalation&#xD;
      decision. Dose escalation/de escalation will be conducted using the Bayesian Optimal Interval&#xD;
      Approach (BOIN).&#xD;

    <description>A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications with an onset within the first 6 weeks (42 days) of treatment. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0 will be used for AE grading.</description>

    <description>Duration of response (DOR) only applies to participants whose best overall response is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 based on tumor response data per local review. The start date is the date of first documented response of CR or PR (i.e. the start date of response, not the date when response was confirmed), and the end date is defined as the date of the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer. Participants continuing without progression or death due to underlying cancer will be censored at the date of their last adequate tumor assessment.

    <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be assessed via local review according to RECIST 1.1. If no PFS event is observed, PFS will be censored at the date of the late adequate tumor assessment prior to data cut-off date and start of new anti-neoplastic therapy, whichever comes first.&#xD;
PFS will be analyzed in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population according to the assigned dose level combination. The PFS distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Kaplan-Meier curves, medians and 95% confidence intervals of the medians will be presented for each dose level combination.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years (estimated final Overall Survival (OS) analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of first dose to date of death due to any cause. If a participant is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the latest date the participant was known to be alive (on or before the cut-off date).&#xD;
OS will be analyzed in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population according to the assigned dose cohort. The OS distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Kaplan-Meier curves, medians and 95% confidence intervals of the medians will be presented for each dose level combination.</description>
