      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health (NIH), published Final Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Organ Policy Equity (HOPE)&#xD;
      Act Safeguards and Research Criteria for Transplantation of Organs Infected With HIV. All&#xD;
      such transplants must occur under an institutional review board (IRB) approved research&#xD;
      protocol that is compliant with federal regulations governing human subjects research. This&#xD;
      is an investigator-initiated, observational prospective study of solid organ transplantation&#xD;
      utilizing HIV-positive donors in HIV positive recipients. Stable HIV-infected adults in need&#xD;
      of a solid organ transplant (kidney) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for&#xD;
      organ transplantation will be offered enrollment in the study. Deceased donors (kidney) and&#xD;
      living donors (kidney) will be utilized in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to increase knowledge about the safety, efficacy, and&#xD;
      effectiveness of solid organ transplantation (SOT) utilizing HIV-positive donors in&#xD;
      HIV-positive recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective study of solid organ transplantation utilizing&#xD;
      HIV-positive donors in HIV-positive recipients. Stable HIV-infected adults in need of a solid&#xD;
      organ transplant (kidney) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for organ&#xD;
      transplantation will be offered enrollment in the study. Deceased donors (kidney) and living&#xD;
      donors (kidney) will be utilized in this protocol. 25 stable HIV-infected adults in need of a&#xD;
      solid organ transplant (kidney) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for organ&#xD;
      transplantation and 5 living donors (kidney) will be offered enrollment in the study. Living&#xD;
      donors will be followed under a separate addendum protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each HIV-positive recipient and prospective HIV-positive recipient will be provided an&#xD;
      independent advocate who is responsible for protecting and promoting the rights and interests&#xD;
      of the HIV-positive recipient (or prospective recipient). The purpose of the independent&#xD;
      advocate for the HIV-positive recipient is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Promote and protect the interests of the HIV-positive prospective recipient (including&#xD;
           with respect to having access to a suitable HIV-negative organ if it becomes available).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Take steps to ensure that the HIV-positive recipient's decision is informed and free&#xD;
           from coercion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Review whether the potential HIV-positive prospective recipient has received information&#xD;
           regarding the results of Solid Organ Transplantation in general and transplantation in&#xD;
           HIV positive recipients in particular and the unknown risks associated with HIV-positive&#xD;
           to HIV-positive transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants who provide informed consent will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      pre-transplant phase of the study. In the pre-transplant phase of the study, standard and&#xD;
      HIV-specific eligibility will be confirmed. Enrolled participants will consent to the&#xD;
      collection of retrospective medical record data including but not limited to clinic notes,&#xD;
      laboratory data, diagnostic procedures and reports for all prior HIV therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA) and Organ Procurement and&#xD;
      Transplantation Network (OPTN)/Policy 15.6, at the time of transplant listing &quot;willing to&#xD;
      accept an HIV-positive organ&quot; status will be indicated in the secure database used by both&#xD;
      transplant hospitals and organ procurement organizations to coordinate organ recovery and&#xD;
      waitlist candidate matching. HIV-positive matches will be run for study participants who have&#xD;
      indicated an interest in HIV+ organs. If an HIV+ organ becomes available for a participant,&#xD;
      the participant will have an opportunity to accept or defer the organ offer. Participants who&#xD;
      accept an HIV+ or HIV suspected false positive organ offer will enter the Post-Transplant&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase for HIV D+/R+ participants and participants who accept an HIV- (D) organ&#xD;
      offer will enter the Post -Transplant Follow-up Phase for HIV D-/R+ participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be followed prospectively for up to 5 years. Demographic and clinical&#xD;
      data on the donors and recipients (and outcomes) will be extracted from the United Network&#xD;
      for organ Sharing (UNOS) and Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) databases.&#xD;
      During this prospective follow-up, all medical record data includes but is not limited to&#xD;
      records of hospitalization, laboratory reports, clinic notes, medication lists, biopsy&#xD;
      results, and documentations of current therapies.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. No evidence of invasive opportunistic complications of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pre-implant donor organ biopsy showing no disease process that would put the recipient&#xD;
             at increased risk of rapid progression to end-stage organ failure, to be stored for&#xD;

             Blot, positive HIV ab IFA, or history of detectable HIV-1 RNA) from a CLIA approved&#xD;
             laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If known history of HIV infection and prior antiretroviral therapy, the study team&#xD;
             must describe the anticipated post-transplant antiretroviral regimen(s) to be&#xD;
             prescribed for the recipient and justify its conclusion that the regimen will be safe,&#xD;
             tolerable and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pre-implant donor organ biopsy to be stored, at a minimum, for the duration of the&#xD;
             study (or at least 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For donors with newly diagnosed/discovered HIV-1 infection, any HIV-1 RNA viral load&#xD;
             is allowed assuming the donor meets other criteria and the HIV/Transplant Infectious&#xD;

             tolerable and effective ART regimen for the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Donors with documented chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV+) co-infection (detectable HCV&#xD;
             nucleic acid using any licensed assay in a CLIA certified lab) can be used only for&#xD;
             HCV+ participants.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Fewer than 50 copies/mL of HIV- 1 RNA detectable by ultrasensitive or real-time&#xD;
                  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No evidence of invasive opportunistic complications of HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A kidney biopsy showing no evidence of a disease process that would put the donor at&#xD;
             increased risk of progressing to end-stage organ failure after donation, or that would&#xD;
             present a risk of poor graft function to the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A complete history of ART regimens and ART resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The study team must be able to predict a safe, tolerable, and effective regimen to be&#xD;
