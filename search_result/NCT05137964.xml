      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conceived with the objective to assess ovarian reserves in presence of vitamin&#xD;
      D deficiency (VDD) in a select group of Pakistani sub fertile women, presenting at a&#xD;
      specialized fertility centre. The measurements of antral follicle count (AFC), Serum&#xD;
      Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH), Serum Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Serum Vitamin D&#xD;
      (VD) levels were the main tools used for the assessment of ovarian reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials &amp; Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Australian&#xD;
      Concept Medical Centre after approval from the institutional ethical review committee. All&#xD;
      female patients aged 18 to 45 years, presenting with primary and/or secondary subfertility,&#xD;
      at the Australian Concept Medical Centre in Karachi, Pakistan from August 2016 to July 2021&#xD;
      were included in the study (n=301). Inclusion criteria was focused on subjects labelled as&#xD;
      sub fertile by the consultant gynecologist, based on the criteria of failed to conceive after&#xD;
      12 months of no contraceptive use. Patients with missing data i.e., BMI, duration of&#xD;
      subfertility, age, AMH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), AFC and FSH were further excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biochemical analysis was performed at the section of Chemical Pathology, department of&#xD;
      Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi. 25-OHD was analyzed by a&#xD;
      chemiluminescence assay on the liaison XL (DiaSorin) analyzer. AMH was measured using electro&#xD;
      chemiluminescence assay on the Roche Diagnostic e411 analyzer. While FSH quantification was&#xD;
      done using ADVIA Centaur FSH assay from Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics USA. The&#xD;
      internal and external quality assurance was ensured according to the institutional protocol.&#xD;
      Moreover, the laboratory is accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and&#xD;
      Joint Commission international, ensuring external quality assurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AFC was determined through a transvaginal 2D ultrasound of the pelvis. To reduce the bias,&#xD;
      all ultrasound scans were conducted in the center using the same machine (Model 6v1:&#xD;
      Sonoscape) and vaginal probe (3.5 Hz). Before ultra sound procedure, patients were directed&#xD;
      to empty bladder and a standard ultrasound technique was used. Two values were obtained, one&#xD;
      for each ovary, and an average was taken to obtain a final value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of all eligible patients was recorded in the pre-defined Performa designed for this&#xD;
      study. The Kruskal-Wallis Test and one way ANOVA was applied to report the distribution of&#xD;
      the data. The correlation between the categorical variables (25-OHD levels with AFC and AMH)&#xD;
      was assessed using the Chi-Square test and Spearman Correlation. Comparison was based on&#xD;
      25-OHD levels grouped into three categories: deficiency (&lt;20ng/ml), insufficiency (21-29&#xD;
      ng/ml) and sufficiency (&gt;30ng/ml). AMH was categorized as low (&lt;1 ng/ml), low normal (1-2&#xD;
      ng/ml), normal (2-4 ng/ml), and high (&gt;4 ng/ml). The third variable, AFC, was also classified&#xD;
      into very low (&lt;6), low normal (6-8), normal (8-10), high normal (10-12), very high (&gt;12).&#xD;
      The p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was&#xD;
      performed using the statistical software IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 23.0 (IBM&#xD;
      Corp. Released 2015. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).&#xD;
