      Popular topic：Clinical study on the immune program of recombinant Novel Coronavirus&#xD;
      (COVID-19) vaccine (CHO cell). Research purpose:Main purpose: To evaluate the immunogenicity&#xD;
      of recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) inoculated at 0,1,6 months in persons&#xD;
      aged 18 years and over. Secondary purpose: To evaluate the safety of trial vaccine in people&#xD;
      18 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design: In this study, a single-arm design was used to evaluate the immunogenicity&#xD;
      and safety of recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) inoculated at 0,1,6 months in&#xD;
      persons aged 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:The study involved people 18 years of age and older. Test groups：A total of&#xD;
      300 subjects were enrolled, including 200 in the 18-59 age group and 100 in the ≥60 age&#xD;
      group. Three doses of experimental vaccine were administered according to the 0,1,6 month&#xD;
      immunization schedule.&#xD;

      Overall design:In this study, a single-arm design was used to evaluate the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety of recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) inoculated at 0,1,6 months in&#xD;
      persons aged 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A total of 300 subjects were enrolled, including 200 in the 18-59 age group and&#xD;
      100 in the ≥60 age group. Three doses of experimental vaccine were administered according to&#xD;
      the 0,1,6 month immunization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 5.0mL of venous blood was collected from all subjects for immunogenicity test before&#xD;
      the first dose, before the third dose, on day 14 and 180 after full immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events (AE) were collected 30 minutes after each dose, all AE (both solicitor and&#xD;
      non-solicitor) were collected 0-7 days after each dose, and all AE (non-solicitor) were&#xD;
      collected 8-30 days after each dose. All SAE from the first dose up to 6 months after full&#xD;
      immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solicitation AE (the following events occurring within 7 days of vaccination) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events at the inoculation site (local) : pain, swelling, induration, redness, rash,&#xD;
      pruritus; Vital signs: fever; Non-inoculated site (systemic) adverse events: headache,&#xD;
      fatigue/fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain (non-inoculated site), acute&#xD;
      allergic reaction, cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs and physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All subjects underwent a daily armpit temperature examination during the screening&#xD;
           period, before subsequent doses, and within 7 days after each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All subjects underwent physical examination (skin and cardiopulmonary auscultation) and&#xD;
           blood pressure measurement during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADE/VED (Antibody Enhancement/vaccine Enhancement disease) Risk Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After vaccination (at least one dose of experimental vaccine), if the subject is diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19, he/she should go to the hospital for hospitalization or be isolated in&#xD;
      accordance with the epidemic prevention and control requirements of the area in which he/she&#xD;
      is located. A special investigation should be conducted for the existence of ADE/VED in&#xD;
      severe/critical cases/deaths.&#xD;
