  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moral distress has been described as a condition with frustration, guilt, anger and as one&#xD;
      reason for health care professionals to leave the profession. Ethics communication in groups&#xD;
      has been showed to work as support for health care professionals in ethically difficult&#xD;
      situations and further work as a tool to improve the ethical climate and prevent moral&#xD;
      distress. Our research group has developed the &quot;one to five-step method&quot; for&#xD;
      interprofessional ethical communication in groups. The overall aim of this project: is to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate a method for organized interprofessional communication about ethical&#xD;
      issues in healthcare.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ethically difficult situations are a part of the everyday clinical practice for health care&#xD;
      professionals and concerns difficult judgements, prioritization and crucial decisions. Being&#xD;
      unable or prevented to act according to one's moral conviction for what is good and right&#xD;
      care may increase the risk for health care professionals to experience moral distress. Moral&#xD;
      distress has been described as a condition with frustration, guilt, anger and as one reason&#xD;
      for health care professionals to leave the profession. Ethics communication in groups has&#xD;
      been showed to work as support for health care professionals in ethically difficult&#xD;
      situations and further work as a tool to improve the ethical climate and prevent moral&#xD;
      distress. Our research group has developed the &quot;one to five-step method&quot; for&#xD;
      interprofessional ethical communication in groups. The method is a stepwise support for&#xD;
      facilitating ethics communication in clinical practice when the situations occurs. The&#xD;
      overall aim of this project: is to implement and evaluate a method for organized&#xD;
      interprofessional communication about ethical issues in healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The study can generate knowledge about ethics communication in groups in line&#xD;
      with the &quot; one to five step method&quot;, reduce moral distress, create improved ethical climate&#xD;
      for healthcare professionals and in turn open up prerequisites for good care.&#xD;
