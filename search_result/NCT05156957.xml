  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapy is a long established therapy in lower back pain. It is unknown if&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic interventions in patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with&#xD;
      nonspecific lower back pain are beneficial. The aim of this study is to assess whether&#xD;
      patients presenting to the emergency department with non-specific low risk low back pain&#xD;
      would benefit from a physiotherapy intervention, as compared to patients without&#xD;
      physiotherapy intervention at time of ED presentation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 and at Day 7 ± 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>This self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0, Day 7 ± 3 days, Day 21 ± 3 days, Day 42 ± 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain ('0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;))</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in StarT Back Screening Tool (SBST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, at 3rd follow-up visit (at Day 42 ± 3 days after Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The SBST categorises back pain patients into 3 categories: low, medium and high risk. It consists of 9 items, each with a value of 0 or 1 points. The SBST Score is calculated by summing the points from each question, with a minimum score of 0 points and a maximum score of 9 points.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of a brief physiotherapeutic assessment by a short physical performance battery, a brief information on the expected course of the condition and instructions on self-management regarding back friendly behaviour (eg. respecting the pain, staying active and back friendly movement strategies). Additionally, three exercises for daily self-guided therapy are included to the intervention: Turning in bed and coming to a sitting position, sit to stand and squats standing in front of a wall.</description>
