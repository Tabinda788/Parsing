  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partners in School is a collection of implementation strategies (e.g., communication&#xD;
      training, problem-solving consultation) to help parents/primary caregivers and teachers of&#xD;
      children with autism spectrum disorder implement the same practices across home and school.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A small scale pilot trial of Partners in School with education communication skills (ECS)&#xD;
      training will be implemented. Teachers (n=24) will be randomly assigned to receive Partners&#xD;
      in School (pre-consultation, consultation, implementation of student intervention, and post-&#xD;
      consultation) with ECS (n=12; between pre-consultation and consultation) or without ECS&#xD;
      (n=12). Each teacher will work with two parents (n=48), with both conditions having 24 dyads.&#xD;
      Pre and post measures will assess mechanisms of change, proximal, and distal outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Adapted LEAPS Questionnaire about ECS training (A-LEAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The A-LEAPS will be an 18-item parent questionnaire (adapted patient form) and a 23-item teacher questionnaire (adapted physician form). At the baseline self-assessment, parents and teachers will be asked to report on their communication practices using never, sometimes, or always used. At the post-consultation self-assessment, they will be asked to again reflect on their communication practices, but this time with the specific Partners in School parent-teacher consultation meeting just completed. An example item is, &quot;I set an agenda for the meeting so that I am sure we get to all the things I want to cover.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PTRS-II is a 24-item measure that examines the degree of connection felt between parent and teacher pairs, by examining joining (affiliation and support, dependability and availability, shared expectations and beliefs, and communication from the other) and communication to the other (sharing of emotion and sharing of information). A five-point Likert scale is used from almost never to almost always. An example item is, &quot;I don't like the way this teacher talks to me.&quot;</description>

    <description>Daily home-school notes will list the steps in the student intervention plan generated during the consultation meeting. Parents and teachers will indicate whether each step was completed at home or at school, respectively. The number of intervention steps completed by parents (parent fidelity) and teachers (teacher fidelity) will be computed.</description>

Parents and teachers will indicate whether each step was completed at home or at school, respectively. The number of steps in the student intervention plan completed by both parents and teachers will be used as the measure of continuity.</description>

    <measure>Frequency and Severity Form (FSF)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Using the FSF form, the consultant will ask parents and teachers to report on the top three concerns that they have for the child, as well as to rate the frequency and severity of each of those concerns. The frequency question asks, &quot;How often does this occur with your child at school or at home?&quot; The concern is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from rarely to always. The severity question asks, &quot;How much does this impact your child's daily functioning at school or at home?&quot; The concern is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from rarely to extremely. This measure was designed specifically for Partners in School.</description>
