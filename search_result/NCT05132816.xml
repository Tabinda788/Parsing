  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a combined retro- and prospective, monocentric study. All patients who underwent or&#xD;
      are planned for laparoscopic partial fundoplication (180° anterior or 270° posterior) between&#xD;
      2020-2023 are assessed for preoperative ineffective esophageal motility (IEM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is, that preoperative oesophageal motility disorders, especially&#xD;
      hypo-contractility or failed peristalsis, are caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux. Therefore,&#xD;
      postoperative manometry after partial wrap fundoplication (270° posterior, 180° anterior)&#xD;
      shows a decrease in comparison to preoperative motility disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the postoperative esophageal motility in&#xD;
      patients with known preoperative motility disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are the presence of other oesophageal motility disorders pre- vs.&#xD;
      postoperatively (including new onset disorders), the assessment of the Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) pre- vs. postoperatively, and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If IEM is present preoperatively, patients are contacted at least 1 year after surgery and&#xD;
      will be informed about the study and asked to participate. In case of agreement, they are&#xD;
      invited to the study site. They undergo high-resolution manometry 18-24 months&#xD;
      postoperatively (study intervention).&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the incidence of persistent postoperative ineffective motility according to the Chicago classification, defined as ≥ 7/10 (70%) of swallows with weak contraction (distal contraction interval (DCI) between 100mmHg/s/cm and less than 450 mmHg/s/cm) or ≥ 5/10 (50%) of swallows with failed peristalsis (DCI &lt;100mgHg/s/cm), measured in a high-resolution manometry with multiple swallows in patients having undergone laparoscopic partial-wrap 270° posterior or 180° anterior fundoplication.</description>

    <description>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) pre- vs. postoperatively. The GSRS is a disease-specific instrument of 15 items combined into five symptom clusters depicting Reflux, Abdominal pain, Indigestion, Diarrhoea and Constipation. The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-type scale where 1 represents absence of troublesome symptoms and 7 represents very troublesome symptoms.</description>

    <description>High-resolution manometry is an outpatient examination and part of our routine diagnostic or pre-operative evaluation in GERD.&#xD;
A thin catheter is placed through the nose into the esophagus, local anaesthesia can be used if the patient experiences a discomfort. Once the tip of the manometry catheter is placed below the esophagogastric junction, the patient is asked to take in water and bread. In rest and during deglutition, pressure measurements are registered with the manometry catheter, allowing the investigator to detect IEM. The examination takes about 1.5 hours. The manometry is a standard and routine intervention being performed for over 30 years with minimal risks.&#xD;
The GSRS questionnaire pre- and postoperatively is part of our standard workup, no additional assessment for this study is needed.</description>
