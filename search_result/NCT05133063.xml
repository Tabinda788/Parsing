  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a randomized mixed between-within experimental stress-testing protocol&#xD;
      design. Physiological responses (blood pressure and pulse) will be recorded throughout a&#xD;
      baseline, gratitude induction, standard stress-task and recovery period. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to the experimental (grateful induction) or control condition (neutral&#xD;
      induction). Gratitude will be induced by completing a gratitude letter. Demographics will be&#xD;
      measured. Psychosocial and health variables will be measured psychometrically at baseline to&#xD;
      assess pre-existing levels and after both manipulations (allocated induction and stress task)&#xD;
      to monitor expected change over time between conditions. Stress task is an adapted version of&#xD;
      the Trier Stress Testing protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will employ an experimental within-subjects design, in which all participants are&#xD;
      exposed to the same task and measures. The study will take place in Cubicle 1 of the&#xD;
      Psychology Department, 2nd floor John Hume Building. On entry into the lab, participants will&#xD;
      first be required to read the study information sheet and provide informed consent before the&#xD;
      formal testing session begins. This standard protocol will comprise of the collection of&#xD;
      demographic information, the administration of questionnaires (See supporting documentation)&#xD;
      and the monitoring of physiological responses. The monitoring phase involves the following&#xD;
      periods, a 20 minute acclimatisation, 10 minute baseline, 8 minute intervention, a 12-stress&#xD;
      task and a 10 minute recovery period. During baseline general socio-demographic and lifestyle&#xD;
      information will be collected through standard questionnaires (e.g. age, gender, height&#xD;
      smoking status, health status and family history pertaining to the cardiovascular system; see&#xD;
      supporting documentation). If predictive of blood pressure in the current study all potential&#xD;
      confounds will be controlled for statistically in relevant analyses to isolate the&#xD;
      contribution of the predictor variables, in this case state and trait gratitude, to the&#xD;
      cardiovascular changes. Physiological responses -systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR)- will be measured noninvasively using a GE Dinamap&#xD;
      Pro 400 and will be recorded throughout with a standard blood pressure cuff placed over the&#xD;
      brachial artery on the participant's non-dominant arm. During the baseline phase&#xD;
      psychological variables will be measured psychometrically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this baseline phase, participants will randomly be allocated to either the control&#xD;
      or experimental condition. The experimental condition will involve writing a letter thanking&#xD;
      someone the participant had not thanked before. The control group will complete a writing&#xD;
      exercise wherein they describe the laboratory room. They will have 8 minutes to complete&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this intervention phase, participants will then complete an adapted form of the&#xD;
      widely used Trier Social Stress Test, which involves participants subtracting numbers out&#xD;
      loud and giving a short speech wherein they describe three of their best and worst&#xD;
      characteristics . After the stress task, in the recovery phase participants will answer a&#xD;
      series of questions pertaining to how they found the stress task. Following this, all&#xD;
      participants will be fully debriefed (supporting documentation) and thanked for their&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

Think of someone in your life who you feel like you have never fully or properly thanked for something meaningful or important that they did for you. . . . In the space provided below, please write a note to this person that describes why you feel like you never properly thanked them and letting them know why you feel thankful for something important that they did for you. Though this letter will not actually be sent to this person and is simply an exercise for you, please use this as an opportunity to really explore those feelings surrounding how you feel about what they have done for you and write honestly and openly from your heart. You have ten minutes.</description>
