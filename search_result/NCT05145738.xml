  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a hybrid computer- and person-delivered intervention, called&#xD;
      &quot;C-Raven&quot; for smoking cessation that is tailored to people with tobacco use in Baltimore&#xD;
      City. The computer delivered component consists of two ~20 minute sessions on an iPad guided&#xD;
      by Edna Poe, an interactive avatar. These sessions are followed by elective in vivo&#xD;
      initiation of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Community health workers (CHWs) trained in&#xD;
      smoking cessation and motivational interviewing provide 6 weeks of supportive follow up&#xD;
      counseling. The investigators propose a pilot of the intervention package in the Tobacco&#xD;
      Treatment and Lung Cancer Screening Clinic (TTLCSC) at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Broadway Center for Addiction, assessing feasibility and acceptability of using this&#xD;
      tool in these clinical settings. In addition, the investigators will compare whether the use&#xD;
      of a virtual counselor is associated with greater satisfaction and engagement with the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the investigators propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial, randomizing up&#xD;
      to 90 individuals with tobacco use to the current CRAVEN program which includes a virtual&#xD;
      counselor, to CRAVEN without a virtual counselor. Primary outcomes include intervention&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability. The investigators will secondarily examine uptake and&#xD;
      maintenance of pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, readiness to quit smoking, and tobacco&#xD;
      cessation (7 day abstinence) at 6 months, patient satisfaction by intervention arm and CHW&#xD;
      engagement by intervention arm.&#xD;
