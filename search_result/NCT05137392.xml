  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achievement of adequate oral hygiene standards is critical to the successful treatment of gum&#xD;
      disease. The improvement of the patient's adherence to good oral hygiene is of great&#xD;
      importance to obtain the satisfactory treatment outcomes. However, patients' adherence to a&#xD;
      proper daily oral hygiene regimen generally remains poor. New electric artificial&#xD;
      intelligence powered toothbrushes are able to precisely sense the location of the brushing&#xD;
      being performed by the patient and transmit information to the clinician who is able to&#xD;
      analyze the data and provide targeted instructions, if needed. This study evaluates whether a&#xD;
      novel oral hygiene instruction regimen can provide some additional benefit for periodontal&#xD;
      treatment compared with routine oral hygiene instructions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental plaque is causally linked to gingival inflammation and essential for the onset of&#xD;
      periodontitis. The main goal of periodontal treatment is the establishment of adequate&#xD;
      infection control to reduce the bacterial load below individual threshold levels of&#xD;
      inflammation. Achievement of adequate oral hygiene standards is critical to effective&#xD;
      periodontal therapy. Classical studies have shown that professional tooth cleaning during&#xD;
      healing of subgingival debridement provides superior outcomes. Regrettably, costs do not&#xD;
      allow routine implementation of these regimens. By far, patient-centred homecare is the most&#xD;
      cost-effective approach to maintaining good oral hygiene. Therefore, improving the adherence&#xD;
      with self-performed oral hygiene is a priority in periodontal practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventionally, clinicians provide oral hygiene instructions to the patients based on the&#xD;
      results of their clinical examinations, sometimes supplemented with written information in&#xD;
      brochure and disclosing agents to show the location of the biofilm. However, patients'&#xD;
      adherence to a proper daily oral hygiene regimen generally remains poor. New technology based&#xD;
      on an internet of things network of intelligent toothbrushes (i-Brush) has shown excellent&#xD;
      adherence of use in a pilot study in a maintenance population. Other studies have shown that&#xD;
      electronic messaging and mobile health (mHealth) supported by smartphones and applications&#xD;
      improve oral hygiene performance, particularly in younger individuals undergoing orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment. New electric artificial intelligence powered toothbrushes are able to precisely&#xD;
      sense the location of the brushing being performed by the patient and transmit information to&#xD;
      the clinician who is able to analyze the data and provide targeted instructions, if needed.&#xD;
      Remote sensing of oral hygiene practices through the connected intelligent powered toothbrush&#xD;
      allows more specific and targeted messages, thereby promoting personalized oral health care&#xD;
      and eventually improving the healing outcomes of periodontal therapy through a two-way&#xD;
      communication between patients and clinicians. This study aims to investigate the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel regimen consisting of a new generation of power-driven internet connected&#xD;
      i-Brush and targeted m-Health messages in improving periodontal treatment outcomes in&#xD;
      comparison with routine oral hygiene instructions.&#xD;
