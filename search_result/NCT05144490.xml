  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether an 11-minute bodyweight exercise session can improve&#xD;
      short-term glycemic control. Glycemic control refers to the process of how the body regulates&#xD;
      blood sugar. The process can be measured in different ways. This study will use a small&#xD;
      device called a continuous glucose monitor to measure changes in glucose levels over a&#xD;
      24-hour period. Participants will complete two trials and we will compare glycemic control&#xD;
      after the exercise session and a control period that does not involve exercise. Food intake&#xD;
      will be controlled such that each participant will consume the same diet in both conditions.&#xD;
      This study will help us understand whether a single session of bodyweight exercise affects&#xD;
      glycemic control.&#xD;

      This study will investigate whether an 11-minute bodyweight exercise session can improve&#xD;
      short-term glycemic control. Glycemic control will be assessed using continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring for 24-hours following exercise or a control condition that does not involve&#xD;
      exercise. The exercise and control periods will be directly supervised by a study&#xD;
      investigator. Participants will complete two trials in a randomized, crossover manner&#xD;
      separated by 7 days. Food intake will be controlled such that each participant will consume&#xD;
      the same diet over the 24-hour period of measurement in both conditions. Standardized meals&#xD;
      will be provided to participants prior and following the exercise and control conditions.&#xD;
      This study will determine whether a single session of bodyweight exercise affects glycemic&#xD;
      control as primarily assessed by mean 24-hour glucose.&#xD;
