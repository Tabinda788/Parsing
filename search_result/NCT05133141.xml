    <time_frame>interoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Echelon Contour success based on surgeon responses on question 1 in the surgeon reported outcome measures (SROM) will be reported. Surgeon will be asked to choose option &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; for following question: Did Echelon Contour provide acceptable performance considering other therapeutic alternatives?</description>

    <time_frame>28 days post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, regardless of its relationship to the study device or the study procedure. An untoward medical occurrence includes any new, undesirable medical experience or worsening of a pre-existing condition, which occurs throughout the duration of the clinical study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elective colorectal procedure where Echelon Contour is planned to be used for&#xD;
             transection and resection of the colon&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to give consent and comply with all study-related evaluations and visit&#xD;
             schedule. If the participant is less than (&lt;) 18 years of age, the participant's&#xD;
             parent/legal guardian must be willing to give permission for the participant to&#xD;
             participate in the study and provide written Informed Consent for the participant. In&#xD;
             addition, assent must be obtained from pediatric participants who possess the&#xD;
             intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved in the study.&#xD;
             If the pediatric participant is not able to provide assent (due to age, maturity&#xD;
             and/or inability to intellectually and/or emotionally comprehend the study); the&#xD;
             parent/legal guardian's written Informed Consent for the participant will be&#xD;
             acceptable for the participant to be included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anatomical region must be of sufficient size for the device to be used&#xD;
