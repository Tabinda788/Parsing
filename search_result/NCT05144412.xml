      Little is known about the status of maternal, obstetric and neonatal complications and the&#xD;
      potential predictors of developing heart failure (HF) in the mothers with underlying heart&#xD;
      disease (HD) in Southwestern China. Eligible samples were screened from December, 2010 to&#xD;
      December, 2019. Maternal clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were collected and&#xD;
      compared in women with and without HD, and in HD subtypes: valvular heart disease (VHD),&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), pulmonary hypertension (PH) and other&#xD;
      cardiac condition.&#xD;

      Data Source and Study Population We enrolled patients from seven main medical centers in&#xD;
      Southwestern China,that was used to characterize outcomes from December 1, 2010 to December&#xD;
      31, 2019. All pregnant women (excluding abortion, nonfirst delivery, multiple births) were&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion in the present analysis. Cardiac disease of pregnant woman in the&#xD;
      analysis mainly included valvular heart disease (VHD), cardiomyopathy, adult congenital heart&#xD;
      disease (ACHD), pulmonary hypertension (PH) and other cardiac conditions (primary arrythmia,&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, anemic heart disease, hyperthyroid heart disease and others). Only&#xD;
      singleton records with a unique medical identified number were used in our analysis. Patients&#xD;
      aged &lt;18 years and those with missing information including unique patient identifiers were&#xD;
      excluded. Records with the same date of birth, admission date, discharge date, and facility&#xD;
      name were considered as pure duplications, and only one of such records was kept. The data&#xD;
      set was analyzed retrospectively, and the informed consent requirement was waived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were defined and classified mainly as&#xD;
      the following two types from ISSHP (International Society for the Study of Hypertension in&#xD;
      Pregnancy) Classification, Diagnosis, and Management Recommendations for International&#xD;
      Practice: Hypertension known before pregnancy or present in the first 20 weeks; Hypertension&#xD;
      arising de novo at or after 20 weeks.[10] Maternal major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were&#xD;
      defined as a composite of arrhythmia, shock, cerebrovascular events, heart failure,&#xD;
      respiratory failure, in-hospital death, pulmonary embolism, dissection of any artery.[3, 11,&#xD;
      12] Cardiac procedural intervention was also recorded for patients with and without HD.&#xD;
      Non-MACE maternal outcomes included acute renal failure, total hospital charges and&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (all types). Obstetric complications mainly included&#xD;
      adherent placenta, abruptio placenta, breech delivery, DIC (disseminated intravascular&#xD;
      coagulation), early or threatened labor, known or suspected fetal abnormality, laceration,&#xD;
      long labor, placental insufficiency, placenta previa, precipitate labor, premature rupture of&#xD;
      membranes, polyhydramnios, postpartum hemorrhage and infection. Neonatal adverse clinical&#xD;
      events (NACE) were a composite of fetal death (in utero), neonate death (within 30 days of&#xD;
      birth), prematurity (&lt;37 weeks), intrauterine growth restriction, respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome and intracranial cerebral events. NON-MACE variables including infant of low-birth&#xD;
      weight (weight&lt;2500g) and fetal macrosomia (weight&gt;4000g) were also measured. HF was defined&#xD;
      in these patients with various underlying heart diseases as a clinical syndrome that was&#xD;
      characterized by specific symptoms (dyspnea and fatigue) and signs (of fluid retention, such&#xD;
      as edema, rales) as judged by the treating cardiologist according to ACC/AHA guidelines.[13]&#xD;
      Information for the present analysis was obtained through review of the institutional&#xD;
      database, into which data had been entered on discharge of each patient.&#xD;
