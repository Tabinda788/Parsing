  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decision to give fluids or not should not be taken lightly. Indeed, excessive or&#xD;
      insufficient fluid administration is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Prediction of fluid responsiveness relies on the use of a hemodynamic variable to determine&#xD;
      how likely a patient is going to respond to a fluid bolus with a significant increase in&#xD;
      their cardiac output or stroke volume. Depending on the response to fluids, patients are&#xD;
      either responders or non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, we have many techniques to predict fluid responsiveness. However, almost all require&#xD;
      the use of an advanced hemodynamic monitoring device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Predicting fluid responsiveness is important in the operating room in order to avoid&#xD;
      unnecessary fluid administration. Over the last 15 years, a number of dynamic tests have been&#xD;
      developed which are based on the principle of inducing short-term changes in cardiac preload,&#xD;
      using heart-lung interactions, the passive leg raise or by the infusion of small volumes of&#xD;
      fluid, and to observe the resulting effect on cardiac output or stroke volume. Pulse pressure&#xD;
      and stroke volume variations were first developed, but they are reliable only under strict&#xD;
      conditions. The variations in vena caval diameters share many limitations of pulse pressure&#xD;
      variations. The passive leg-raising test is now supported by solid evidence and is more&#xD;
      frequently used but not practical in the operating room. More recently, the end-expiratory&#xD;
      occlusion test has also been described, which is easily performed in ventilated patients.&#xD;
      Unlike the traditional fluid challenge, these dynamic tests do not lead to fluid overload.&#xD;
      The dynamic tests require the insertion of an arterial catheter linked to an advanced cardiac&#xD;
      output monitoring device which is costly and not applicable in lower risk patients without an&#xD;
      arterial line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, it is recommended to use alveolar recruitment maneuvers, consisting in&#xD;
      the transient administration of higher pressure levels, allowing to re-ventilate certain&#xD;
      pulmonary territories by re-expanding alveoli that would have collapsed under mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. In daily practice, it is generally accepted that a patient presenting a&#xD;
      significant fall in stroke volume or mean arterial pressure during an alveolar recruitment&#xD;
      maneuver is preload dependent, but the scientific evidence in the literature remains&#xD;
      insufficient to date. A previous study has also demonstrated the ability to predict preload&#xD;
      dependence via analysis of central venous pressure during a recruitment maneuver. By&#xD;
      extrapolation, we would like to evaluate the capacity of peripheral venous pressure to&#xD;
      predict this preload dependence.&#xD;
