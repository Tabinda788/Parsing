    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an overall objective to examine&#xD;
      the effect of an interdisciplinary complex intervention on the level of fatigue in lymphoma&#xD;
      survivors with chronic fatigue. Secondary aims are to examine the effects of the intervention&#xD;
      on daily functioning, work ability, physical fitness, QoL and cortisol secretion among the&#xD;
      survivors, on QoL of their relatives and on the societal costs.The intervention will last for&#xD;
      12+12 weeks and include four components; patient education, supervised physical exercise,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral program and nutritional counselling. Outcomes will be assesed at&#xD;
      baseline,post-intervention (12 weeks after baseline) and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      after copmpleted intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic fatigue (CF) is a subjective experience of substantial lack of energy, exhaustion and&#xD;
      cognitive difficulties lasting for six months or longer. CF is one of the most common and&#xD;
      distressing late effects after cancer, affecting 15-35 % of survivors, often for years beyond&#xD;
      treatment. Despite the high prevalence and the huge negative consequences of CF on daily&#xD;
      functioning and QoL and the economic and societal costs, effective treatment of CF and&#xD;
      standardized follow-up care are currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, there is no curative treatment of CF. However, several modifiable behavioral factors&#xD;
      including emotional distress, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances and unhealthy diets are&#xD;
      found to be associated with CF. So far, most of the interventions aiming to reduce fatigue&#xD;
      during and shortly after cancer treatment have targeted only one of these factors at a time,&#xD;
      with small to moderate effect sizes. No prior study has examined if CF in cancer survivors is&#xD;
      better treated by a complex intervention targeting combinations of these factors, an approach&#xD;
      which seems logical due to the complexity of the symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a two-armed RCT in which chronically fatigued lymphoma survivors are&#xD;
      randomized to an interdisciplinary complex intervention or to usual care. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive written information about the study by mail. Survivors who perceive&#xD;
      themselves as having physical and mental fatigue, and who are willing to participate, will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out and return the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ) to the study coordinator.&#xD;
      Those who have chronic fatigue as measured by the FQ will be invited to a medical screening&#xD;
      by an oncologist in the project group, for evaluation of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interdisciplinary complex intervention will last for 12 + 12 weeks and include four&#xD;
      components; patient education, physical exercise (and follow-up), cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      program and nutritional counselling, organized in a systematic way, i.e. a standardized&#xD;
      patient care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes will be assessed in all participants at four points; pre-intervention (baseline)&#xD;
      (T0), post-intervention (12 weeks after baseline) (T1) and at 3-month (T2) and 6-month (T3)&#xD;
      after T1.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in quality of life among the relatives measured by Research and Development 36-term Short Form Health Survey (RAND SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (T0) to 12 weeks (T1)</time_frame>
    <description>RAND-36 comprises 36 items that assess eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations caused by physical health problems, role limitations caused by emotional problems, social functioning, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, pain, and general health perceptions. Physical and mental health summary scores are also derived from the eight RAND-36 scales.All questions are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible.</description>

    <description>The interdisciplinary complex intervention lasts 12 weeks and includes the 4 following components;&#xD;
Patient-education: a 2-hours group-based digital session, including information about fatigue, training theory, psychological strategies and nutrition, all in relation to chronic fatigue (CF).&#xD;
Physical exercise program: two weekly sessions with aerobic exercise and resistance training. The participants are instructed to do the same program in the unsupervised sessions as in the supervised sessions. After the first 12 weeks exercise period, the participant and the physiotherapist makes an individually tailored plan for exercise and follow-up the next 12 weeks.&#xD;
Cognitive behavioral program: 6 group-based online sessions lead by two psychologists, based on elements from cognitive behavioral therapy to reduce and/or manage CF. Each session lasts for 135 minutes.&#xD;
Nutritional counselling: 3 individual sessions by a clinical dietitian. Each session lasts for 30-60 minutes.</description>
