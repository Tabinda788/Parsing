  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 4th most common cause of cancer death globally but only&#xD;
      20% are diagnosed in its early stages where curative treatment can be carried out. Current&#xD;
      standard-of-care surveillance of patients at high risk of developing HCC with 6-monthly serum&#xD;
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound imaging (US) has a sensitivity of approximately 63%&#xD;
      for detecting early HCC. There is an urgent need for a more efficacious and convenient&#xD;
      modality of surveillance of high-risk patients to diagnose HCC at an early stage. In another&#xD;
      study (AHCC10 ELEGANCE, NCT04965259), 2,000 patients at risk of developing HCC will be&#xD;
      enrolled to develop the 1st miRNA in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) kit for HCC that has higher&#xD;
      accuracy and better ease of use compared with the extant combination of AFP and US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will act as a positive control to the AHCC10 ELEGANCE Study and aims&#xD;
      to address the absence of efficacious modalities of surveillance by validating a panel of&#xD;
      circulating miRNA biomarkers signatures with histologically proven HCC. This study will&#xD;
      determine progressive changes in the profiles of miRNA signatures pre- and post- surgical&#xD;
      resection to identify signatures predictive of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study also aims to identify changes in key metabolites and microbiome with&#xD;
      correlation to changes in choline, bile acid and tryptophan metabolic pathways in the gut&#xD;
      microbiota to establish actionable biomarkers that can predict HCC recurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study involving 100 patients with diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) confirmed by histology at surgical resection. Eligible patients will receive CT scans&#xD;
      at 6 months and 12 months post-surgery to monitor for recurrence. Pre- and post-surgery&#xD;
      bio-samples (blood, urine, stool) will also be collected to monitor changes in profiles of&#xD;
      miRNA, metabolome and microbiome.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is male or female patients, 21 to 90 years of age at the time of signature&#xD;
             of the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has clinically AND histologically proven HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has R0 or R1 resection on histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has Child-Pugh &lt;= 7 points without clinical ascites before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has ECOG performance status 0-1 before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is scheduled for liver resection within 6 weeks of signing screening&#xD;
             informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received no anti-cancer specific treatment for HCC before the surgery&#xD;
             (eg. previous liver resection, loco-regional therapy such as RFA, TACE, SIRT,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy), other than&#xD;
             the planned surgery. However, patient who has received previous HCC resection more&#xD;
             than 5 years ago is deemed to have a de-novo liver tumour and therefore can be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to comply with scheduled visits, assessments and other study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is willing to provide informed consent before enrolment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites, except&#xD;
             effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or&#xD;
             effectively treated malignancy that has been in remission for over 5 years and highly&#xD;
             likely to have been cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has active hepatic encephalopathy at time of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received a major organ allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is known to be positive for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has an uncontrolled bleeding disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has uncontrolled congestive heart failure or hypertension, unstable heart&#xD;
             disease (coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction) or uncontrolled arrhythmia&#xD;
             at the time of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability&#xD;
             to give informed consent, or to comply with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has other concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy,&#xD;
             that would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to&#xD;
             unacceptable risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received any investigational or non-registered medicinal product (drug&#xD;
             or vaccine) within the 30 days preceding the date of enrolment, or plans to receive&#xD;
             such a drug during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female patients: the patient is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is unable to provide informed consent or refuse blood taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigators, would&#xD;
             make the patient unsuitable for enrolment or could interfere with completion of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
