  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study mainly evaluates the resolution of uterine fibroids by microwave ablation. The&#xD;
      medical equipment used is Ke Hui. &quot;The Ampening ablation system is a percutaneous surgery.&#xD;
      During laparoscopic surgery, it is directly ablated and soft, including problems that cannot&#xD;
      be solved by partial or complete tissue ablation. &quot;Hydrogen is used. If the expected range of&#xD;
      ablation can be found, there is no need to wait for 3 to 6 months for ablation slowly like&#xD;
      Haifu surgery. A fast, small, high-quality treatment that provides reference for medical&#xD;
      treatment and helps doctors choose the most suitable treatment.&#xD;

      A collection of 20 women suffering from uterine fibroids were treated with microwave fibroids&#xD;
      ablation for symptoms of uterine fibroids, and they could be discharged the next day or two&#xD;
      days after surgery. Schedule return visits and routine blood tests according to clinical&#xD;
      needs, and follow up with ultrasound and questionnaires during routine return visits (1, 3,&#xD;
      and 6 months) after surgery. In the third month after surgery, there will be another imaging&#xD;
      report. Magnetic resonance imaging and blood tests are used to compare the changes of&#xD;
      patients' fibroids, their physiological recovery status, and the degree of improvement in&#xD;
      their quality of life.&#xD;
