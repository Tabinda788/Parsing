      Single arm pilot study to evaluate the safety and initial feasibility of the Neurolyser XR, a&#xD;
      high intensity focused ultrasound device, for non-invasive treatment of axial chronic low&#xD;
      back pain&#xD;

      Study design: Prospective, single arm Timeline: nine month enrollment period and 12 months&#xD;
      follow-up period. Sites: The study will be conducted at 10 sites in up to ten USA Study&#xD;
      population: Thirty adult subjects diagnosed with facet related low back pain with an&#xD;
      additional 10 roll in subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective: Safety and efficacy of the Neurolyser XR for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic low back pain secondary to zygapophyseal joint syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety is measured by the incidence and severity of treatment related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy is measured by MRI imaging .&#xD;
