    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate heart rate activity and sleep patterns, among&#xD;
      participants in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using mobile health (mHealth) technologies in a large and well-characterized cohort of&#xD;
      childhood cancer survivors, our primary objective is to understand the magnitude of increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiac autonomic dysfunction by (a) comparing prevalence rates among survivors and&#xD;
      siblings, and (b) determining the prevalence within specific subgroups of childhood cancer&#xD;
      survivors defined by race, sex, cancer type and treatment exposures, and type and severity of&#xD;
      chronic health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among long-term (≥5 years) survivors of childhood cancer (a) identify demographic, disease,&#xD;
      treatment and cognitive-behavioral factors associated with an increased risk of cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunction, (b) develop and validate risk prediction models for future clinical&#xD;
      use in identifying individuals who may benefit from targeted interventions, and (c)&#xD;
      investigate associations between dysfunction and perceived well-being.&#xD;

      Potential participants will be recruited by email and phone. Survivors who wish to&#xD;
      participate will complete an online consent form and then a series of short questionnaires to&#xD;
      determine study eligibility. This data collection will take place in DatStat Connect, which&#xD;
      is the online consenting and data collection tool utilized for the CCSS. Consented/enrolled&#xD;
      SJLIFE participants will receive a link via email to complete surveys related to autonomic&#xD;
      functioning and current medical concerns and asked to schedule delivery of a WHOOP® strap&#xD;
      prior kit prior to scheduling a device setup session with a team member. The kit will include&#xD;
      the WHOOP® strap, brief instructions for setup, and prepaid return mailing materials. The&#xD;
      WHOOP® strap will be shipped to the participant and each participant will complete a training&#xD;
      session and app installation, if needed, and instructions regarding during of wear (two&#xD;
      weeks)&#xD;
