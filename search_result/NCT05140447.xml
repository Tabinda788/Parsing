    <intervention_model_description>Forty posterior teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 20 teeth. According to types of restorative materials used (A), the first group was restored by Bis-GMA free resin composite (A1) and the second group was restored by Bis-GMA containing resin composite (A2).&#xD;
Each group was subdivided into 2 subgroups of 10 teeth each according to preheating temperatures used (T), the first subgroup (T1) was preheated at 50◦ C and the second subgroup (T2) was preheated at 70◦ C.</intervention_model_description>

All readings were taken with the presence of a rubber dam and recorded in Celsius (°C).&#xD;
Five temperature readings were measured for each tooth; (C0): pulpal floor temperature before beginning the restorative procedure. (C1): pulpal floor temperature during placement of preheated composite. (C2): top composite surface after packing and before curing. (C3): pulpal floor temperature after curing of the preheated composite. (C4): top composite surface after curing. The pulpal floor and the restoration temperature of each tooth was measured by a K-type temperature Probe attached to portable mini type thermometer device</description>
