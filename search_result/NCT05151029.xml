      2.2 Aim(s) of the Research (50 words max): To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      Sonoelastography in the evaluation of major salivary gland lesions using histopathology as&#xD;
      gold standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Salivary gland diseases are ranging from the minor inflammatory conditions to a group of&#xD;
      benign and malignant neoplasms. Most of the salivary gland disorders manifest themselves as&#xD;
      the enlargement of the gland which may be associated with pain or swelling. Physical&#xD;
      examination together with laboratory analyses may not be sufficient to discriminate these&#xD;
      diseases . Therefore, an accurate, non invasive diagnostic method is needed to discriminate&#xD;
      these diseases (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is considered the gold&#xD;
      standard for preoperative diagnosis (2), it is an invasive method requiring significant&#xD;
      experience to avoid complications like injury of the facial nerve as it courses within the&#xD;
      parotid gland. This explains the continuing desire for further non-invasive diagnostic&#xD;
      options (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current imaging modalities are ultrasonography, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI). Despite being highly sensitive, they lack the accuracy in&#xD;
      differentiating benign and malignant lesions because of considerable overlap between the&#xD;
      imaging features of benign and malignant salivary gland lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonoelastography is a new technique that depends on the elastic properties of soft tissues,&#xD;
      with the idea of malignant lesions being stiffer than benign or normal tissue. It may have a&#xD;
      dependable role in diagnosing different salivary gland diseases, the same way it has been&#xD;
      used in different parts of the body, such as the breast, lymph nodes, and thyroid (4). To the&#xD;
      best of our knowledge, there are few studies concerning the role of elastography in the field&#xD;
      of salivary gland disease.&#xD;

        Patients will be scanned in the supine position during free-breathing, with subtle neck&#xD;
        hyperextension and tilt to the opposite side of the evaluation. The parotid and&#xD;
        submandibular glands will be carefully examined in the transverse and longitudinal&#xD;
        dimensions with an 8-12 MHz linear array transducer. Doppler assessment will then be done&#xD;
        Subsequently, sonoelastography will be performed with the same depth and focus and gained&#xD;
        settings as for grey scale imaging. First, strain elastography will be performed. The&#xD;
        elastogram image of the detected lesion, will be evaluated using color coding . stiffness&#xD;
        compared to normal parenchyma using a 4-grade system like the performed. Strain ratio&#xD;
        values of all the lesiongrading presented by Dumitriu D et al. Second, shear wave&#xD;
        elastography will be ps ,will also be calculated individually. All will be compared with&#xD;
        histopathology results.&#xD;
