  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A first-in-human, unblinded, phase I trial of Paclitaxel-loaded tumor penetrating&#xD;
      microparticles (TPM) in peritoneal carcinomatosis patients who are not eligible for&#xD;
      standard-of-care therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human study of Paclitaxel-loaded TPM, suspended in 0.5 L of 0.1%&#xD;
      polysorbate 80 in normal saline instilled into the peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An enrolled patient will (a) undergo laparoscopy during which time the hydrostatic pressures&#xD;
      at different locations within the peritoneal cavity are measured, pretreatment tumors are&#xD;
      biopsied and peritoneal catheter is placed, (b) receive intraperitoneal TPM during index&#xD;
      hospital stay, and (c) followed-up to evaluate treatment-related toxicity and response. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TPM and paclitaxel in peritoneal fluid and systemic blood samples will be&#xD;
      measured. Second dose of TPM is given in clinic if no disease progression or significant AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study. Dose escalation will proceed using an accelerated titration&#xD;
      design (ATD) with intra-patient dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 patient exhibits DLT during the first course of treatment or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 patients exhibit grade 2 study drug-related (attribution of probable or definite)&#xD;
           toxicity during the first course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design switches to a standard 3+3 design at the dose that triggered the switch-two&#xD;
      additional patients are accrued at this dose level. Decisions on when and how to escalate if&#xD;
      the design switches to a 3+3 are described in the protocol section 6.3&#xD;

    <description>Paclitaxel-loaded TPM, suspended in 0.5 L of 0.1% (w/v) polysorbate 80 in 0.9% sodium chloride is instilled into the peritoneal cavity over 3 to 5 minutes. Mixing of TPM is achieved by putting patient in 5 different positions for about 80 minutes.&#xD;
Dose escalation, the starting dose of TPM is 50 mg/m^2 paclitaxel-equivalents. Dose escalation will follow the Accelerated Titration Design. The dose levels to which patients will be assigned in sequential cohorts are listed below.&#xD;
Dose escalation schedule of TPM, Dose Level 1*: 50 mg/m^2; Dose Level 2: 100 mg/m^2; Dose Level 3: 135 mg/m^2; Dose Level 4: 175 mg/m^2; Dose Level 5: 200 mg/m^2&#xD;
