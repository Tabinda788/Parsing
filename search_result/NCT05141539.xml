  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current cervical range of motion (CROM) and tongue movement measurement methods are not&#xD;
      reliable between observers, which is not practical in real-world usage. This research is to&#xD;
      develop the cervical range of motion measurement, and tongue movement estimation software, to&#xD;
      compare between the developed software and the current measurement techniques, and to test in&#xD;
      clinical aspects for reliability and validity assessment. The investigators investigate the&#xD;
      developed software in healthy people in phase 1. In phases 2 and 3, the investigators compare&#xD;
      the software to the standard measurement methods in dysphagic patients who have head and neck&#xD;
      cancer for reliability and validity.&#xD;

    <description>This arm applies the developed rehabilitation assessment software by using two web cameras placed in the front and the side of the subject. The subject sits between two cameras. The observer asks the subject to move the head in each direction, to open the mouth, and to move the tongue. The software will measure CROM, mouth opening, and tongue movement.</description>
