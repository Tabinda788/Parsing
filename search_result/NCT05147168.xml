      This study will investigate the reliability and validity of Chinese version of the quality of&#xD;
      life scale in EORTC QLQ-PAN26 and EORTC QLQ-C30 on pancreatic cancer patients in Taiwan&#xD;

      1. Verify the reliability and validity of Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 Quality of&#xD;
           Life Scale and the chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-PAN26 Quality of Life Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verify the construct validity of the Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-PAN26 Quality of&#xD;
           Life Scale, perform factor analysis, test-retest reliability, and known group validity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Verify the criterion related validity of Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 Quality of&#xD;
           Life Scale and the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was evaluated by self-assessment of various clinical problems for a week.The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists three subscales with 30 questions.The EORTC QLQ-C30 included three subscales: functioning scales (15questions), symptom scales (13 questions), and global health status (2questions). The reliability and validity of Cronbach'α was 0.52-0.89. About the functional scale and the global health status, the higher the total score, the better the quality of life; the lower the score in the symptom scale, the better the quality of life.</description>

The reliability and validity of Cronbach'α was 0.69-0.97. About the functional scale, the higher the total score, the better the quality of life; the lower the score in the symptom scale, the better the quality of life.</description>
