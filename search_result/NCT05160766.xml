  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled, adaptive, multicentre Phase II trial evaluating different&#xD;
      booster strategies in individuals aged 75 years and older already vaccinated against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. This trial foresees testing of different vaccines as a third/booster dose for&#xD;
      comparative assessment of their immunogenicity and safety against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      variants in the elderly, a usually neglected population. Different vaccines and extended&#xD;
      follow-up visits can be added through amendments of this sub-protocol. As stated in the&#xD;
      EU-COVAT master protocol, this trial, i.e., the EU-COVAT-1 Aged study, implements a specific&#xD;
      safety monitoring strategy.&#xD;
