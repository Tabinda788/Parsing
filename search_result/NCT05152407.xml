      The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of a serum containing 0.3% of MRB, a&#xD;
      cosmetic active ingredient, against actinic lentigo and actinic keratosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin aging is an extremely complex multifactorial process that disrupts the functions and&#xD;
      structure of epidermal and dermal cells and extracellular matrix components and has multiple&#xD;
      causes including extrinsic phenomena (UV radiation, exposure to pollution, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has important effects on the skin and is particularly apparent on the face. Indeed,&#xD;
      sunlight, in particular ultraviolet light, is an important factor that contributes to&#xD;
      cutaneous photoaging by inducing the photo-chronic generation of reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      (ROS). Although skin has its own antioxidant system against ROS, these antioxidant defenses&#xD;
      are not fully effective during sun exposure and weaken over time. Photoaging of the skin is&#xD;
      characterized by the development of pigmentary disorders, such as actinic lentigos (AL), as&#xD;
      well as benign skin tumors such as actinic keratosis (AK), both of which are target&#xD;
      pathologies for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AL usually occur in the elderly. They are usually benign but can cause aesthetic problems.&#xD;
      They are commonly seen on the hands but can appear on all areas of the body, especially on&#xD;
      sun-exposed areas such as the face, back, arms, feet, shoulders and skull. There are&#xD;
      different treatment approaches, including physical therapy such as laser therapy, pulsed&#xD;
      light, chemical peeling, bleaching and cryotherapy or topical therapy such as hydroquinone&#xD;
      (HQ). Although topical therapies are generally more time consuming compared to physical&#xD;
      therapies, patients can control their own treatment and side effects can be decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AK is a very common skin lesion caused by chronic sun damage that typically measure less than&#xD;
      1 cm in diameter. KA is considered a premalignant epithelial skin lesion that may progress to&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma. For this reason, all KA should be treated and clinical follow-up is&#xD;
      recommended. The goals of treatment are: (i) to clinically eradicate obvious and subclinical&#xD;
      lesions, (ii) to prevent their progression to EC, and (iii) to reduce the number of relapses&#xD;
      and consequently increase the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment with antioxidant properties/actions that would allow the reduction of&#xD;
      damaged cells seems to play a role in both the prevention and treatment of AL and KA (Nashan&#xD;
      et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a paper published in early 2020 highlighted a major role for carbonylation in&#xD;
      the progression of this type of skin lesion (Tramutola et al., 2020). Based on these&#xD;
      elements, we hypothesize that our cosmetic active ingredient - MRB - which has antioxidant&#xD;
      activity and a specific and original chaperone effect giving it a strong capacity to fight&#xD;
      against protein carbonylation- will be effective in the treatment of photo-induced signs of&#xD;
      aging: keratoses and actinic lentigo, by a mechanism that acts on the oxidative stress&#xD;
      pathway and the maintenance of cellular proteostasis.&#xD;
