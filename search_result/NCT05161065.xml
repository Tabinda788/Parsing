    <textblock>
      The WatchQT study will compare the performance of a smartwatch combined with Cardiologs ECG&#xD;
      AI Analysis system in monitoring corrected QT (QTc) intervals with that measured on a&#xD;
      manually read 12-lead ECG in subjects with Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) during antiarrhythmic&#xD;
      drug (AAD) initiation and follow-up at the hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WatchQT Study is a prospective, non-significant risk, non-randomized, monocentric, open,&#xD;
      comparative, concordance pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under subject consent, subjects hospitalized for AAD initiation and monitoring will have&#xD;
      smartwatch ECG recordings done simultaneously with 12-lead ECG measurements before and after&#xD;
      drug administration twice a day, in accordance with the existing in-stay subject monitoring&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
