    <textblock>
      The Staphylococcus aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) trial is an International&#xD;
      Multi-Centered Randomised Adaptive Platform Clinical Trial to evaluate a range of&#xD;
      interventions to reduce mortality for patients with Staphylococcus Aureus bacteraemia (SAB).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection of the bloodstream with the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
      bacteraemia, SAB) is a serious infection that results in 15-30% of affected patients dying&#xD;
      within three months of acquiring the infection. Treatment of this infection requires patients&#xD;
      to be hospitalised, treated with prolonged antibiotics through an intravenous line, and&#xD;
      carefully examined for the occurrence of complications associated with this condition. At&#xD;
      present, there are many treatment options in current use, with no clear agreement as to which&#xD;
      of these is best. The SNAP trial aims to identify which treatment options for SAB results in&#xD;
      the fewest patients dying within the first 90 days after an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to a conventional clinical trial, the SNAP trial will examine multiple different&#xD;
      treatment options at once. Patients will be randomly assigned to different concurrent&#xD;
      treatment options currently considered acceptable in routine medical care, but as the trial&#xD;
      progresses, more patients will be assigned to treatments that appear to have better outcomes&#xD;
      than those with worse outcomes. The trial will adapt to accumulating trial evidence, on a&#xD;
      regular basis, by removing treatment options found to be inferior, incorporating new&#xD;
      treatment options, and ensuring that all patients in the trial receive the best treatments&#xD;
      once they have been identified. Over time, we hope to determine the best combination of&#xD;
      treatment options for patients with SAB.&#xD;

          1. Time to allocation reveal is &gt;72 hours from time of index blood culture collection&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Severe allergy to any beta-lactam (including cefazolin)&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Immediate severe allergy: Anaphylaxis/angioedema&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Severe delayed allergy: Severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR; including Steven&#xD;
                  Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and&#xD;
                  Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)),&#xD;
                  severe drug induced liver injury, proven allergic interstitial nephritis,&#xD;
                  immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and other severe cytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-severe rash to cefazolin&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) Nausea, diarrhoea, headache and other non-specific symptoms are NOT allergies, they&#xD;
             are drug intolerance, and they are not exclusion criteria. Similarly, a vague history&#xD;
             of an allergy of unclear nature, or a family history of allergy are not exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severe allergy or non-severe rash to both vancomycin AND daptomycin&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) Vancomycin infusion reaction (formerly known as &quot;red man syndrome&quot;) is due to&#xD;
             direct histamine release and is not generally an allergy, and therefore is not&#xD;
             considered an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treating team deems enrolment in the domain is not in the best interest of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        EARLY ORAL SWITCH DOMAIN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Day 7 (+/- 2 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clearance of SAB by platform Day 2: blood cultures negative for S. aureus from&#xD;
             platform Day 2 onwards AND no known subsequent positive blood cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Afebrile (&lt;37.8°C) for the past 72 hours (at time of judging eligibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Primary focus is either line related (either central or peripheral IV cannula) or skin&#xD;
             and soft tissue, AND source control achieved (for 'line-related' this means line&#xD;
             removed; for 'skin and soft tissue' means site PI considers source control to have&#xD;
             been achieved and any abscess more than 2cm diameter has been drained)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No evidence of metastatic foci (on clinical or radiological examination, but&#xD;
             radiological imaging is not required to exclude metastatic foci if not clinically&#xD;
             indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Day 14 (+/- 2 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clearance of SAB by platform Day 5: blood cultures negative for S. aureus from&#xD;
             platform Day 5 (+/-1 day) AND no known subsequent positive blood cultures. If the most&#xD;
             recent blood culture from Day 2-4 is negative for S. aureus, blood cultures do not&#xD;
             need to be repeated on Day 5 to fulfil eligibility criteria (Day 5 blood cultures will&#xD;
             be assumed to be negative in this situation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Afebrile (&lt;37.8°C) for the past 72 hours (at time of judging eligibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Site Principal Investigator has determined that source control is adequate&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        When judging eligibility at platform Day 7 (+/- 2 days) and at Day 14 (+/- 2 days),&#xD;
        exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adherence to oral agents unlikely (as judged by site PI in consultation with the&#xD;
             treating team)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unreliable gastrointestinal absorption (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea, nil by mouth,&#xD;
             anatomical reasons)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. There are no appropriate oral antibiotics due to contraindications, drug availability,&#xD;
             or antibiotic resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ongoing IV therapy unsuitable e.g. no IV access&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinician deems not appropriate for early oral switch&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient no longer willing to participate in domain&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) In the lead-up to judging eligibility, it may be helpful to discuss with the&#xD;
             patient the potential for continued IV treatment versus oral switch, to allow hospital&#xD;
             discharge planning&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinical team deems that sufficient duration of antibiotic therapy has already been&#xD;
             provided&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusions when judging eligibility for early oral switch at trial Day 7 (+/- 2 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of prosthetic cardiac valve, pacemaker or other intracardiac implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known presence of intravascular clot (excluding superficial peripheral IV line-related&#xD;
             thrombophlebitis), graft or other intravascular prosthetic material&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Intravascular/intracardiac infections (e.g. endocarditis, mycotic aneurysm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of other intracardiac abnormalities felt to put patient at increased risk of&#xD;
             endocarditis (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve)&#xD;
