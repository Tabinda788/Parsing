  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      Classroom Behavior Support Program (CBS; a multi-component, individually-tailored teacher&#xD;
      consultation program) on teachers' classroom management practices (universal and targeted)&#xD;
      and resulting student behavioral and educational outcomes relative to a best practices&#xD;
      comparison consultation condition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be 165 general education teachers (teaching Kindergarten through 6th grade)&#xD;
      who have room for growth in classroom management skills, along with their classroom of&#xD;
      students and one target student with inattentive and/or disruptive behavior problems.&#xD;
      Teachers will be recruited over 3 cohorts (1 cohort per year). Teachers will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two consultation conditions and participate for an entire academic year.&#xD;
      Teachers in both conditions will be scheduled to receive consultation every other week&#xD;
      between August and December and one time per month between January and March. The focus of&#xD;
      the consultation will be teacher implementation of universal classroom management practices&#xD;
      (Tier 1) and the targeted intervention applied with the target student (either a daily report&#xD;
      card and organization intervention; Tier 2). Teachers will be observed weekly and data from&#xD;
      observation will be incorporated into consultation sessions. Investigators will examine the&#xD;
      main effects of consultation on growth in teacher practices (universal and targeted) and&#xD;
      change in proximal and distal student outcomes (classwide and in target students), as well as&#xD;
      the mediators and moderators of these effects.&#xD;

    <measure>Teacher Percent Appropriate Response to Rule Violation (ARRV) - Whole Class (Tier 1 Teacher Outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>Growth from baseline through study completion, an average of 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Student Behavior-Teacher Response (SBTR) observation system, each student rule violation is tallied using a frequency count procedure. Following each rule violation, teacher responses are coded. Investigators calculate a percent appropriate response for each observation. Scores range from 0% to 100%; higher scores represent better response. Observations are conducted weekly for the duration of the trial (30-minutes each). Data are averaged across observations between consultation sessions.</description>

    <measure>Teacher Percent Appropriate Response to Rule Violation (ARRV) - Target Student (Tier 2 Teacher Outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>Growth from baseline through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Once the target student is identified and consented (typically 2 months after the start of school), target student behaviors are observed using the Using the Student Behavior-Teacher Response (SBTR) observation system. Each target student rule violation is tallied using a frequency count procedure. Following each rule violation, teacher responses are coded. Investigators calculate a percent appropriate response for each observation. Scores range from 0% to 100%; higher scores represent better response. Observations are conducted weekly for the duration of the trial (30-minutes each). Data are averaged across observations between consultation sessions.</description>

    <description>Using the Student Behavior-Teacher Response (SBTR) observation system, each instance of praise (labeled and unlabeled) directed at the target student is tallied using a frequency count procedure. Using the observation duration, investigators calculate a rate of praise per hour. Scores range from 0 to any upper limit; higher numbers represent more teacher praise statements made to the target student per hour. Observations are conducted weekly for the duration of the trial (30-minutes each). Data are averaged across observations between consultation sessions.</description>

    <description>Using the Student Behavior-Teacher Response (SBTR) observation system, each Opportunity to Respond (OTR; a question asked to a group of children that facilitates engaged attention) is tallied using a frequency count procedure. Using the observation duration, investigators calculate a rate of OTRs per hour. Scores range from 0 to any upper limit; higher numbers represent more teacher use of OTRs per hour. Observations are conducted weekly for the duration of the trial (30-minutes each). Data are averaged across observations between consultation sessions.</description>

    <description>Consultants follow the problem-solving process used in the comparison condition and attempt to address barriers to integrity using the knowledge, skills, beliefs, or stress components in the CBS manual. Consultants conduct a Values Interview, so teacher values can be used in the individual goal setting and decision making process. Consultants are trained to (a) incorporate the teacher's values into the problem-solving process, (b) elicit change talk from teachers using techniques borrowed from Motivational Interviewing, and (c) engage in Socratic questioning and cognitive restructuring for beliefs that may be barriers to integrity (e.g., &quot;should&quot; statements). Enhanced performance feedback involves highlighting connections between teacher integrity and child outcomes and using this as a catalyst for a knowledge, skills, beliefs, or stress component. Consultants use change rulers to elicit motivation to achieve the stated goals.</description>

    <description>Consultation in the comparison condition follows a 5-step problem solving approach and provide brief performance feedback procedures that mirror (in duration, content, and process) best practice procedures (Gilbertson et al., 2007; Noell et al., 1997). The guiding principles for this condition are that the performance feedback portion of the session should be limited to 5 to 10 minutes and unless the teacher initiates discussion of other content, the problem solving should remain student-focused, rather than teacher-focused. Discussion on teacher values and beliefs, and attempts to facilitate change talk, are contra-indicated. If the teacher initiates discussion of knowledge, beliefs, or skills, the consultant may answer questions, but may not use strategies associated with Motivational Interview or Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or strategies in CBS condition. We have separate scripts and checklists for each condition.</description>
