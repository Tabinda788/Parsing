      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional movement disorders (FMD) involve involuntary movements that are not due to a&#xD;
      recognized neurological or medical cause. FMD can cause major disability. Researchers want to&#xD;
      learn more to create better treatments for FMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether non-invasive brain stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      improves FMD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between the ages of 18 and 80 who have been diagnosed with FMD by a neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group is an active brain&#xD;
      stimulation group and the other is a sham brain stimulation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit. This will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They will be&#xD;
      asked to respond to images on a screen while in the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 weeks of the baseline visit, participants will begin 5 daily sessions of TMS. The&#xD;
      active group will have stimulation delivered to the brain via a coil. In the sham group, a&#xD;
      dummy coil will be used that will not deliver stimulation. A total of three 3-minute cycles&#xD;
      will be done in one visit. There will be 20-minute breaks between the cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits 1 month, 2 months, and 6 months after their last day of TMS.&#xD;
      Their FMD symptoms will be evaluated. They will complete health questionnaires. These visits&#xD;
      can be in person or virtual.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Functional movement disorder (FMD), a type of conversion disorder, refers to neurologic&#xD;
      symptoms of involuntary movements that are not explained by other neurologic diseases. FMD is&#xD;
      more commonly encountered in the outpatient clinic than Parkinson's disease or multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis, is associated with similar levels of disability and distress, and has poor&#xD;
      long-term outcome. Currently, effective treatments for FMD are lacking due, at least in part,&#xD;
      to incomplete understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this disorder. Most&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions for FMD have focused on physical or cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      but those may not be tailored to its neurobiology. Therefore, there is imperative need to&#xD;
      develop new therapeutic approaches for FMD given its prevalence, disease burden, and the&#xD;
      paucity of treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent study findings converge to indicate that FMD might be associated with dysfunctions in&#xD;
      emotional regulation. FMD patients had greater amygdala activity and impairments in&#xD;
      habituation in response to both positive and negative salient stimuli presented during a fMRI&#xD;
      task. Also, increased connectivity between left amygdala and left middle frontal gyrus was&#xD;
      identified in functional tremor patients compared to essential tremor and healthy control.&#xD;
      The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is critically involved in cognitive regulation of&#xD;
      emotion and reappraisal of emotional stimuli regardless of valence. In patients with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder, top-down endogenous effective connectivity from the DLPFC to the&#xD;
      amygdala was greatly impaired compared to healthy controls. In addition to its role in&#xD;
      emotion regulation, the DLPFC is also functionally connected to the motor system. Functional&#xD;
      connectivity data demonstrated lower functional connectivity of the SMA with bilateral DLPFC&#xD;
      in FMD patients during internally generated actions relative to externally generated actions.&#xD;
      These findings suggest that the DLPFC could be critically implicated in the emotion&#xD;
      dysregulation, motor symptoms, and behavioral manifestations characterizing FMD. Increasing&#xD;
      DLPFC activity in FMD patients may improve emotion processing and reduce motor symptoms by&#xD;
      counteracting amygdala hyperactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a specific repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) protocol that effectively increases cortical excitability of the targeted&#xD;
      brain region after a relatively short stimulation period. iTBS has been approved by U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of depression. iTBS involves pulses being applied&#xD;
      in bursts of three at high frequency (50 Hz) with an inter-burst interval of 200 ms (5 Hz,&#xD;
      which is in the range of theta frequency). In iTBS, 2 s of theta burst trains (30 pulses) are&#xD;
      repeated every 10 s for 190 s, with a total number of 600 pulses. iTBS protocols offer the&#xD;
      advantage of delivering a high number of pulses in a short period (1-3 minutes), allowing for&#xD;
      multiple sessions within the same day, to achieve more pronounced effects than regular rTMS&#xD;
      protocols, without increasing the risk of adverse events. This is supported by the results of&#xD;
      several studies investigating the antidepressant efficacy of iTBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase II trial, we aim to study the efficacy of 5 consecutive daily sessions of iTBS&#xD;
      over the left DLPFC in FMD patients on behavioral and motor changes, by assessing mood&#xD;
      scales, health related quality of life as well as FMD motor symptoms. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      DLPFC iTBS will be efficacious to decrease abnormal movements in FMD patients at 1 month&#xD;
      after 5 daily sessions of intervention. Furthermore, we hypothesize that DLPFC iTBS will&#xD;
      improve mood and quality of life in FMD patients.&#xD;
