  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a leading social and economic burden in the world. It is the main reason of&#xD;
      macrovascular disease incidence and mortality. Prospective studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      high glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in a population of diabetic patients without a history of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. Further, the predictive value of high preprocedural glycemia levels has been&#xD;
      reported in diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of&#xD;
      the present study was to assess the predictive value of preprocedural HbA1C levels for&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications in a large population of diabetic patients undergoing PCI with&#xD;
      stent implantation. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reflects the average blood sugar level in&#xD;
      the past 2-3 months. As glycosylated hemoglobin has been clinically tested and standardized&#xD;
      internationally, increasing evidence is recommended for routine monitoring in diabetes care.&#xD;
      The American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggested that in the treatment of diabetes, blood&#xD;
      sugar control should control HbA1c level below 6.5%. Although，there is evidence that&#xD;
      controlling blood glucose can reduce the incidence of microvascular complications, in the&#xD;
      past three trials, intensive glycemic control did not significantly reduce adverse CV events&#xD;
      in patients with onger duration of diabetes.Therefore, most primary and secondary prevention&#xD;
      guidelines recommend HbA1c below 6.5% or 7% to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus. The optimal target level of glycosylated hemoglobin is still&#xD;
      hotly debated. In addition, there is still lack of evidence for the level of HbA1c in&#xD;
      patients with major vascular disease history in secondary prevention of recurrence&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, to explore and determine the optimal level of blood glucose control is the focus&#xD;
      of controversy in preventing recurrence cardiovascular events in diabetic patients.&#xD;
      Investigator will combine epidemiology and metabolomics to study the effect of glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin on secondary cardiovascular events, and further determine whether to strengthen&#xD;
      hypoglycemic treatment after PCI.&#xD;

        1500 hospitalized diabetic patients with PCI. Patients younger than 18 years old, pregnant,&#xD;
        preoperative HbA1c deletion and chronic maintenance hemodialysis were excluded. According&#xD;
        to ADA and AHA guidelines and predetermined glycosylated hemoglobin values, based on&#xD;
