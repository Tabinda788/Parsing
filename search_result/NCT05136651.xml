  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Access to a flexible spectrum of family-based VA mental health care for Veterans is mandated&#xD;
      by law. Research shows that relationship distress harms Veterans' mental health, physical&#xD;
      health, and mortality, while healthy relationships provide resilience and facilitate recovery&#xD;
      from illness. However, there are many barriers to accessing couple and family care within VA,&#xD;
      including system-level barriers such as insufficient access to specialty providers and&#xD;
      couple-level barriers such as difficulty coordinating schedules and finding childcare.&#xD;
      OurRelationship is an evidence-based, coached online intervention for couples that provides&#xD;
      flexible, accessible, and scalable treatment to improve relationship functioning. This&#xD;
      proposed CDA-2 project will test whether OurRelationship is effective for improving Veterans'&#xD;
      intimate relationships and supporting their rehabilitation. This study supports the mission&#xD;
      of the 2018-2024 Strategic Plan of the Department of Veterans Affairs by improving Veterans'&#xD;
      relationship functioning to enhance their overall quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 75% of Veterans referred for behavioral health assessments endorse significant&#xD;
      relationship concerns, including 60% reporting mild to severe intimate partner violence.&#xD;
      Relationship problems increase risk of cardiovascular illness, exacerbate psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms, impair social and work functioning, and are the most common precipitants of&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and attempts for Veterans. Healthy intimate relationships are a crucial&#xD;
      part of wellness, resilience, and recovery, and biopsychosocial theories of rehabilitation&#xD;
      psychology stress the importance of relationships. Military Veterans have experienced&#xD;
      numerous stressors that increase risk of relationship distress, including deployment and&#xD;
      reintegration cycles, frequent relocation, and physical and mental health sequelae of trauma.&#xD;
      Accordingly, VHA directive 1163.04 in 2019 mandated that all Veterans have access to a&#xD;
      flexible continuum of family mental health services as part of rehabilitation efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, access to couples' interventions is limited, and traditional couple psychotherapy is&#xD;
      not sufficiently scalable. Although most VA medical centers have trained couple therapists,&#xD;
      they are limited in number and location, and they are underutilized due to numerous&#xD;
      logistical barriers couples face including coordinating schedules, dual time off work,&#xD;
      childcare, and stigma. Unsurprisingly, over 60% of divorced couples never accessed couples'&#xD;
      treatment, and Veterans spend four to seven years in relationship distress before getting&#xD;
      help. Digital health is a critical part of solving problems of access to care. Because&#xD;
      digital health interventions for couples can provide flexible access to evidence-based&#xD;
      relationship interventions, they are an essential part of providing the continuum of family&#xD;
      mental health care mandated by VHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OurRelationship is an online adaptation of Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT), the&#xD;
      evidence-based protocol for couple therapy currently in use in the VA healthcare system. It&#xD;
      combines eight hours of a self-paced online couples' program with three 20-minute telehealth&#xD;
      coaching sessions. OurRelationship is a scalable, transdiagnostic, evidence-based couples'&#xD;
      intervention that can help provide access to flexible family mental health services. Several&#xD;
      RCTs demonstrate OurRelationship improves both relationship functioning and individual mental&#xD;
      health. A small secondary analysis from an RCT supports the use of OurRelationship with&#xD;
      Veterans in the community, and the pilot data from 13 couples recruited over two months in&#xD;
      the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) indicate that Veterans find OurRelationship&#xD;
      appealing and helpful. However, OurRelationship has not yet been empirically evaluated with a&#xD;
      Veteran population in a VA care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific goals of this CDA-2 project are to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and efficacy of OurRelationship for improving relationship and individual functioning among&#xD;
      Veteran couples. The proposed 5-year study is a 2-month waitlist-controlled randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. The investigators aim to serve 90 couples (Veterans and their partners, N =&#xD;
      180) who report relationship distress, recruited from mental health clinics within VASDHS.&#xD;
      The sample and recruitment plan is feasible based on the investigators' pilot testing and on&#xD;
      prior RCTs. Data on outcomes including relationship functioning and behavior (e.g.,&#xD;
      communication, conflict), individual functioning (e.g., quality of life, family role), and&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety) will be collected at baseline, mid-program,&#xD;
      post-program, and a 6-month follow-up. The investigators will collect participant feedback&#xD;
      via semi-structured interviews and ratings of program satisfaction and therapeutic alliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine feasibility and acceptability of implementing OurRelationship in a VA&#xD;
      setting with Veterans and their partners, evidenced by quantitative (recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      and satisfaction ratings) and qualitative data (semi-structured interviews soliciting&#xD;
      participant feedback).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate efficacy of the OurRelationship program for Veterans and their partners,&#xD;
      as evidenced by statistically and clinically significant improvements in relationship and&#xD;
      individual functioning that are maintained for 6 months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To explore mediation of improvements in individual functional outcomes by improvements&#xD;
      in relationship functioning.&#xD;
