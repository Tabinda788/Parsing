  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical radiotherapy (RT) has greatly reduced the mortality of patients with malignant head&#xD;
      and neck tumors, which, however, causes a higher risk of carotid artery stenosis, namely,&#xD;
      radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis (RICS) and results in a significant increased risk&#xD;
      of ischemic stroke. The systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by our team showed&#xD;
      carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can yield better results for these patients than carotid artery&#xD;
      stenting (CAS), which was contrary to most previous clinical guidelines. A large-scale&#xD;
      prospective study is needed to verify the results. We will conduct a prospective registry of&#xD;
      RICS patients treated with CEA to evaluate both short-term safety and long-term efficacy&#xD;
      outcomes in a Chinese population.&#xD;

    <description>Surgeons follow the contemporary guideline combined with their experience and preference in order to ultimately select what is best suited for the patient and choose between CEA and CAS. Patients will receive 100 mg of aspirin or 75 mg of clopidogrel daily starting from at least 72 h prior to the CEA procedure and continued receiving the medication indefinitely. General anesthesia is recommended for CEA, although the use of standard or eversion endarterectomy, and a shunt or patch, is left to the discretion of the surgeon.</description>

    <description>Surgeons follow the contemporary guideline combined with their experience and preference in order to ultimately select what is best suited for the patient and choose between CEA and CAS. Patients will be given 100 mg of aspirin plus 75 mg of clopidogrel daily for at least 3 days before the CAS procedure and for 90 days after the procedure. They will receive a daily dose of 100 mg aspirin or 75 mg clopidogrel thereafter. For the CAS procedure, local anaesthesia and predilation prior to stent placement are recommended. Use of an embolic protection device is mandatory for all patients who undergo CAS.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with carotid stenosis who had a history of radiotherapy for head and neck&#xD;
             cancer. (The median interval between the completion of radiation therapy and&#xD;
             development of carotid artery stenosis detected on imaging (or vascular intervention)&#xD;
             was no less than 1 years to avoid non-related situations. The target area of the&#xD;
             radiotherapy included at least the ipsilateral neck, including part of the carotid&#xD;
             system. The internal carotid stenosis was confirmed by angiography, Duplex, 3D&#xD;
             angio-CTA or angio-MRI, and stenosis was defined as &gt; 50% based on North American&#xD;
             Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria), with or without symptom. Patients&#xD;
             with a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke within 6 months were defined as&#xD;
             symptomatic. TIA was defined as a transient episode of neurological dysfunction (focal&#xD;
             weakness/ language disturbance/transient monocular blindness/ requiring assistance to&#xD;
             walk) caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia that lasts for at least 10 min but&#xD;
             resolves within 24 h.)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus defined as glucose &gt; 300 mg/dL (16.67 mmol/L)&#xD;
