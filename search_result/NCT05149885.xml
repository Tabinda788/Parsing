    <textblock>
      SenseGuard (SG) is an innovative device for respiratory monitoring. At this study SG&#xD;
      measurement will be integrated in a Methacholine Challenge Test (MCT) for monitoring changes&#xD;
      in airway obstruction occurred during MCT in parallel to spirometry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SenseGuard (SG) is a wireless wearable medical device intended for monitoring of patient's&#xD;
      breathing. It allows to seamlessly monitor patient's tidal breathing, at rest or during daily&#xD;
      activities, and to extract critical respiratory parameters, such as respiration rate (RR) and&#xD;
      durations, ratios and variability of phases within the breath-cycle, including: inspired&#xD;
      breath (Ti) and expired breath (Te).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study goal is to evaluate the capability of SG to measure clinical changes in respiratory&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Methacholine Challenge Test (MCT), asthma patients demonstrate airway responsiveness&#xD;
      due to airway obstruction. SG will be used to measure respiratory parameters during MCT in&#xD;
      parallel to spirometry and the correlation between measurable respiratory parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful study results will demonstrate the capability of SG to measure changes in airway&#xD;
      obstruction leading to future implementation of SG for monitoring of patients with&#xD;
      respiratory diseases and improvement of their clinical outcome.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, aged â‰¥18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible for MCT procedure. The contradictions to MCT are listed as exclusion&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject who receives one of the following medications, that decrease bronchial&#xD;
             hyperresponsiveness, is required for a washout period, before conducting the MCT:&#xD;
             inhaled bronchodilators, oral albuterol , inhaled and oral glucocorticoids,&#xD;
             leukotriene modifying agents, theophylline, cromolyn, and anti-histamines due to their&#xD;
             anticholinergic effect.&#xD;
