      A 21-Day open label study of transdermally delivered human insulin in Type 2 Diabetics as&#xD;
      measured by response of down modulation of glucose after dosing of Insulin as compared to&#xD;
      historic patient respponse to injected insulins.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A 21-Day open label study of transdermally delivered human insulin in 30 Type 2 Diabetics.is&#xD;
      anticipated. Well-managed Type 2 Diabetics will be added to the protocol from the patient&#xD;
      census of practicing diabetologists and family practitioners, with preference given to&#xD;
      patients already using a wearable Continuous Glucose Monitor (&quot;CGM&quot;) system. Once added to&#xD;
      the protocol, Subjects will be monitored via CGM for two weeks before change of dose form.&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to calibrate the CGM against finger-stick blood sampling and to&#xD;
      poll the monitor sensor at least every 8 hours during the 42 days of monitoring including the&#xD;
      21-day on transdermal dose study period to ensure continuity of interstitial glucose&#xD;
      measurement. Subjects will be monitored for 7 days after the last transdermal dose to monitor&#xD;
      interchageability of the dose forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once baseline data is collected, Subjects will exchange transdermal dosing on a Unit for Unit&#xD;
      basis. Trial materials will be formulated to a concentration of 100 IUs per mL and dispensed&#xD;
      via 0.2 mL metered, finger-actuated pump sprayer, with each pump delivering 20 IUs of Human&#xD;
      Insulin to the skin. If a patient, for example is currently using 120 IUs per day, 40 IUs&#xD;
      basal insulin and 80 IUs Insulin Aspart, 120 IUs or 6 sprays would be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study nurse will contact each subject every day of the study to answer questions and&#xD;
      encourage compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
