  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation is a public health priority. Tobacco is directly responsible for 75,000&#xD;
      deaths per year in France. Without help, less than 5% of smokers are still abstinent after 12&#xD;
      months of smoking cessation. The use of nicotine replacement therapy only increases the&#xD;
      chances of successful smoking cessation by 2-3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain imaging research shows that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC) is involved in&#xD;
      tobacco addiction. Disorders induced in the DLPC cause an irrepressible urge to smoke&#xD;
      (craving) and largely explain relapse during smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) could be a promising tool in the quest for an&#xD;
      effective approach to smoking cessation. This technique is used for direct stimulation of the&#xD;
      DLPC via a magnetic coil in order to reduce the cortical activity of the DLPC and thus to&#xD;
      reduce cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first randomized controlled study using TMS was conducted at the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Dijon in highly addicted smokers who had failed to quit with the usual withdrawal strategies.&#xD;
      In this study, entitled Tabacstim 1, we found that the combination of nicotine substitutes&#xD;
      (to reduce physical withdrawal symptoms) with 10 &quot;attack&quot; sessions of TMS (to reduce&#xD;
      cravings) increased the rate of abstinence during the first 2 weeks of withdrawal (%&#xD;
      abstinence = 88. However, in this study, the therapeutic effect of the nicotine-SMT&#xD;
      combination was not prolonged once the stimuli were stopped. At 6 and 12 weeks from the start&#xD;
      of withdrawal, abstinence rates in the active SMT and placebo SMT groups were no longer&#xD;
      significantly different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore initiated a new study, entitled Tabacstim 2, to add maintenance brain&#xD;
      stimulation to the Tabacstim 1 protocol after the &quot;attack&quot; sessions (this therapeutic scheme&#xD;
      is classically used in the treatment of depression with TMS). This study started in July 2020&#xD;
      and will end very soon (71 inclusions completed out of the 78 expected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both Tabacstim 1 and Tabacstim 2, the stimulations are delivered at low frequency (1 Hz)&#xD;
      on the right DLPC. However, a recently published meta-analysis shows that, in addictions,&#xD;
      stimulations delivered at a high frequency (10 Hz) on the left DLPC appear to be more&#xD;
      effective in reducing craving. But above all, another meta-analysis carried out by our team&#xD;
      (in progress of publication), finds that excitatory stimulations (such as 10 Hz rTMS) on the&#xD;
      left DLPC are very effective in maintaining smoking abstinence in the medium term (3 and 6&#xD;
      months), which does not seem to be the case for inhibitory stimulations (such as 1 Hz rTMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore wish to carry out the Tabacstim 3 study, which only differs from Tabacstim 2 in&#xD;
      two stimulation parameters: 10 Hz stimulations on the left DLPC instead of 1 Hz stimulations&#xD;
      on the right DLPC. We therefore propose in Tabacstim 3 to use excitatory stimulations on the&#xD;
      left instead of inhibitory stimulations on the right.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tabacstim 3 could be more effective for prolonged smoking cessation than the 2 previous&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
