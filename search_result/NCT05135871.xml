  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mavacamten is a small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of cardiac myosin that reversibly&#xD;
      inhibits its binding to cardiac actin, thereby relieving systolic hypercontractility and&#xD;
      improving ventricular compliance. This is an open-label, parallel-group, single-center Phase&#xD;
      1 clinical study. Healthy adult Chinese subjects with different CYP2C19 genotypes (Cohort 1&#xD;
      and Cohort 2: CYP2C19 UM, RM, or NM; Cohort 3: CYP2C19 IM; Cohort 4: CYP2C19 PM) will be&#xD;
      included and administered with a single fasted oral dose of mavacamten to evaluate its PK&#xD;
      profile. Up to 44 subjects will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 44 healthy adult Chinese subjects are expected to be enrolled in this study&#xD;
      according to CYP2C19 genotypes into 4 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (n = 12): ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM), rapid metabolizer (RM), or&#xD;
           normal metabolizer (NM) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 to ensure that data will be&#xD;
           obtained for at least 10 subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 (n = 12): intermediate metabolizer (IM) of CYP2C19 to ensure that data will be&#xD;
           obtained for at least 10 subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4 (n = 8): poor metabolizer (PM) of CYP2C19 to ensure that data will be obtained&#xD;
           for at least 6 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses administered include: 15 mg for cohort 1; 25 mg for Cohort 2; 15 mg for Cohort 3;&#xD;
      15 mg for Cohort 4. Blood samples will be collected from subjects at scheduled time points&#xD;
      for PK testing. Series of safety assessments (including but not limited to AEs, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, vital signs, and ECGs) will be performed during the whole study at specified time&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of the following 5 periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-screening period and Screening period (Day -43 to Day -2, up to 42 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-house period (Day -1 to Day 3, total 4 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient period (Day 4 to Day 75, total 72 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of study visit (Day 75)&#xD;
