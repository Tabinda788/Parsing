      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine that will safely reduce the spread of malaria in&#xD;
      the community by preventing mosquitos from carrying malaria from person to person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess in African adults the safety of and immune response to the administration of&#xD;
      Pfs230D1-EPA/Matrix-M vaccine as compared to the rabies vaccine control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults (18 to 50 years of age) who reside in Sotuba and surrounding villages in Mali&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria comprehension exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to get either the experimental vaccine or the approved&#xD;
      rabies vaccine. They will not know which they are getting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 3 doses of the study or comparator vaccine via injection in the upper&#xD;
      arm. This occurs at the first visit, 1 month, and 2 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 23 scheduled visits over 14 to 16 months. Each visit includes a&#xD;
      physical exam, and blood will be collected at most visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up to 1 year after the final vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants develop an injection site rash or reaction, photographs may be taken of the&#xD;
      site.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT), targeting disruption of parasite&#xD;
      transmission through both human and mosquito, would be a valuable additional resource in the&#xD;
      fight to eliminate this disease. Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) induce anti-sporogonic&#xD;
      antibodies that disrupt parasite transmission to the mosquito, thereby halting transmission&#xD;
      to another human host. Malaria-exposed populations acquire antibody against Pfs230, a&#xD;
      parasite protein expressed by gametocytes in the human stage of P. falciparum and a surface&#xD;
      antigen of gametes and zygotes in the mosquito stage, which suggests that a Pfs230-based&#xD;
      vaccine may be boosted by natural malaria infection. Pfs230D1 has become one of the leading&#xD;
      transmission-blocking antigens for consideration as a licensed TBV to be used either alone or&#xD;
      in combination with other transmission-blocking antigens. Clinical trials with this antigen&#xD;
      adjuvanted with either Alhydrogel or AS01 have provided very encouraging results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, dose-escalating, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study to&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and transmission-blocking activity (TBA) of a&#xD;
      3 dose regimen of Pfs230D1-EPA/Matrix-M versus rabies vaccine in healthy adults. This will be&#xD;
      a first-in-human assessment of Pfs230D1-EPA/Matrix-M and will be conducted as a&#xD;
      dose-escalation trial. Participants will be randomized to 1 of the study arms to receive 1 of&#xD;
      3 dose levels of Pfs230D1-EPA/Matrix-M or a standard dose of comparator rabies vaccine&#xD;
      administered as an intramuscular injection at 3 timepoints. For the 3 Pfs230D1-EPA/Matrix-M&#xD;
      antigen dosages, we will start with a Pilot Group of 5 subjects in each Pfs230D1-EPA/Matrix-M&#xD;
      arm and the rabies vaccine control arm. For the Pilot Group, the different dosage&#xD;
      administrations are separated by approximately 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcomes will include the frequency of systemic and local adverse events and serious&#xD;
      adverse events. Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses measured by ELISA against&#xD;
      Pfs230D1. Functional activity will be assessed by standard membrane feeding assays.&#xD;
