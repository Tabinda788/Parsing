      This study evaluates the efficacy of auricular percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulator&#xD;
      in children, adolescents and young adults with chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a difficult to treat and potentially&#xD;
      debilitating complication of chemotherapy. Nausea and vomiting are one of the most prevalent&#xD;
      and problematic side effects associated with chemotherapy treatment, effecting numerous&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the vagus nerve are important modulators of nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting and are responsible for conveying visceral sensory information to the central&#xD;
      nervous system responsible for nausea and vomiting. The aim of the study is to determine if&#xD;
      stimulating a branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear would reduce the frequency and&#xD;
      severity of nausea and vomiting for patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive active vs sham (non-active) neurostimulation therapy&#xD;
      which would be applied for maximum of 5 days at the onset of inpatient admission for moderate&#xD;
      to severe emetogenic chemotherapy cycle. They will then cross over to the other group (active&#xD;
      vs sham) during the admission of the following identical chemotherapy cycle. Nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, the need for additional antiemetic support and potential side effects will be&#xD;
      monitored during the entire study.&#xD;
