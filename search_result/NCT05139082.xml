    <description>TQB3616 is a highly active CDK4/6 inhibitor. Preclinical studies have shown that it has a strong inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of CDK4/6.&#xD;
TQB2450 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, which prevents PD-L1 from binding to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on the surface of T cells, so as to restore the activity of T cells and thereby enhance the immune response, and has the potential to treat various types of tumors.</description>
