      Coronary Artery Disease is a vascular disease in the category of atherosclerosis, which is&#xD;
      characterized by complete or partial occlusion of the arteries, providing oxygen-rich blood&#xD;
      to meet the metabolic needs of the heart. It was shown as the top 10 causes of death&#xD;
      worldwide in 2017 by the World Health Organization. According to the 2018 data of the Turkish&#xD;
      Statistical Institute (TUIK), it has been reported that 39.7% of the deaths caused by the&#xD;
      circulatory system in Turkey are due to heart diseases. Coronary angiography, which is among&#xD;
      the diagnostic methods of coronary artery disease; It is the process of evaluating the&#xD;
      coronary arteries by making them visible by administering radiopaque material to the femoral,&#xD;
      brachial, radial and axillary arteries during cardiac catheterization. One of the basic roles&#xD;
      of nursing is to provide education for the recovery of the individual and the maintenance of&#xD;
      health. In this context, it is thought that nurses' caring about the role of educator in&#xD;
      patient care will contribute to reducing the patient's anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research; This study was planned to evaluate the effect of pre-procedural education on&#xD;
      patients undergoing coronary angiography on their anxiety level and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was planned as a quasi-experimental study with pretest-posttest control group&#xD;
      design between November 2021 and June 2022. The population of all patients who underwent&#xD;
      coronary angiography in the Cardiology Service of Eskişehir City Hospital, the sample was&#xD;
      calculated using the G-Powr 3.1 program and it was found appropriate to include 79 people in&#xD;
      each group with a 95% CI 90% power. The &quot;Simple Randomization Method&quot; will be used to divide&#xD;
      the individuals who agree to participate in the research into the experimental and control&#xD;
      groups. Since the individuals in the sample group will share the same environment, the&#xD;
      experimental group will be included in data collection on even days and the control group on&#xD;
      odd days. A &quot;Diagnostic Form&quot; will be filled in for all patients in the sample, their vital&#xD;
      signs will be evaluated, and the &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&quot; will be administered. For&#xD;
      the patients in the experimental group; Before the coronary angiography procedure, training&#xD;
      will be given by using the &quot;Training Booklet&quot; prepared by the researchers in line with the&#xD;
      literature and the opinion of the specialist physician. After the coronary angiography&#xD;
      procedure, the &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&quot; will be re-administered to the patients and&#xD;
      their vital signs will be followed. In the control group; Before the coronary angiography&#xD;
      procedure, verbal information will be given for the coronary angiography procedure within the&#xD;
      scope of the routine procedure in the clinic, in line with the information in the patient&#xD;
      consent form. After the procedure, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory will be applied again.&#xD;
      Vital signs will be monitored. The obtained data will be evaluated with appropriate&#xD;
      statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the research, it is thought that the questions of whether the education given&#xD;
      to the patients who will undergo coronary angiography have an effect on reducing the anxiety&#xD;
      levels of the patients and have a positive effect on the vital signs values will be answered.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Research Questions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the training given to the patients who will undergo coronary angiography have an&#xD;
           effect on the anxiety level of the patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the training given to the patients who will undergo coronary angiography have a&#xD;
           positive effect on the vital signs of the patients?&#xD;

    <masking_description>Planning the Simple Randomization Method; Since the individuals in the sample group will share the same environment, it is created by separating different days for the experimental group and different days for the control group. It is planned to divide the sample as the control group on odd days and the experimental group on even days. In the selection of both groups, attention will be paid to the similarity of individual characteristics such as age, gender and educational status.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&quot; will be applied to the patient in the experimental group before the coronary angiography procedure. Then, coronary angiography information training will be given using the Coronary Angiography Training Guide tool. After the angiography procedure, &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&quot; will be applied again. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory: The inventory includes two separate scales consisting of a total of forty items (twenty items in each scale). For both scales; 0-19 points (absent), 20-39 points (mild), 40-59 points (moderate), 60-79 points (severe), 80 points and above are considered as very severe panic. Both scales have direct and reversed statements. In the State Anxiety Inventory, there are ten in total (1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20) and in the Trait Anxiety Inventory seven (21, 26, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39) There are reversed statements.</description>
