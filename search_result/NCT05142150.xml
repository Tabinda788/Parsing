      Prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about end of life care (EOL) in patients with ovarian or other gynaecological&#xD;
      cancers. They typically have a high symptom burden and following several prior lines of&#xD;
      therapy or the development of platinum resistant disease response rates to further active&#xD;
      treatment are limited. Eliciting patients' values and preferences for end-of-life care and&#xD;
      shared decision-making are central elements of patient-centered EOL care. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the feasibility of collecting data on patient satisfaction towards end of&#xD;
      life. Preliminary data on patient and carer satisfaction with care, the importance of aspects&#xD;
      of care, as well as end of life treatment will also be collected. The study will also assess&#xD;
      the carer satisfaction with care during bereavement and with the patient's dying experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit beyond the targeted number of 73 patients number if the study is&#xD;
      progressing favourably. Ideally, each patient will nominate a carer to also complete&#xD;
      questionnaires and who will be able to assist in completing the diary, although this is not&#xD;
      mandatory.&#xD;

    <description>Patient satisfaction will be assessed with CANHELP Lite Individualized. In all CANHELP Lite versions response options for each item range from 1'not at all satisfied' to 5 'completely satisfied' . A 'not applicable/not discussed' response option for items that patients/cares felt was not relevant to their situation. All versions have an overall satisfaction with care score, as well as scores on each of the individual domains. All scores are re-scaled to range between 0 (worst possible value) to 100 (best possible value). The questionnaires will be administered and scored in accordance with the user manual.</description>

    <description>Satisfaction will be assessed with CANHELP Lite bereavement and quality of death and dying (QODD) questionnaire.&#xD;
The QODD questionnaire has 24 items that assess various aspects of dying and death including whether the patient's symptoms were adequately controlled, whether dignity was maintained, time spent with loved ones in days leading up to death and whether the patient's wishes were adhered to. The QODD questionnaire also contains 14 additional items that assess the cargiver's demographic characteristics and relation to the deceased. The response options for each item are rated on a scale from 0 (terrible) to 10 (almost perfect). The items provide a single score, derived as a mean of the item values, transformed to a 0 to 100 scale.</description>
