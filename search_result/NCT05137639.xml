  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of the donor site after radial forearm flap harvesting is a common procedure&#xD;
      in maxillofacial plastic surgery. Unfortunately, free skin graft transplantation faces wound&#xD;
      healing impairments such as necrosis, (partial) graft loss, or tendon exposure. Several&#xD;
      studies have investigated methods to reduce these impairments and demonstrated improvements&#xD;
      if the wound bed is optimized. However, these methods are device-dependent, expansive, and&#xD;
      time-consuming. Therefore, the application of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) to the wound bed&#xD;
      could be a simple, cost effective, and device-independent method to optimize wound-bed&#xD;
      conditions instead. In this study, PRF membranes were applied between the wound bed and skin&#xD;
      graft.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of the donor site after radial forearm flap harvesting is a common procedure&#xD;
      in maxillofacial plastic surgery. It is normally carried out with split-thickness or&#xD;
      full-thickness free skin grafts. Unfortunately, free skin graft transplantation faces wound&#xD;
      healing impairments such as necrosis, (partial) graft loss, or tendon exposure. Several&#xD;
      studies have investigated methods to reduce these impairments and demonstrated improvements&#xD;
      if the wound bed is optimized, for example through negative pressure wound therapy or&#xD;
      vacuum-assisted closure. However, these methods are device-dependent, expansive, and&#xD;
      time-consuming. Therefore, the application of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) to the wound bed&#xD;
      could be a simple, cost effective, and device-independent method to optimize wound-bed&#xD;
      conditions instead. In this study, PRF membranes were applied between the wound bed and skin&#xD;
      graft. Growth factor release could stimulate fibroblast migration, wound healing and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Further more PRF act as a lubricant layer to protect skin graft from tendon&#xD;
      motion. This could improve graft in-growth.&#xD;
