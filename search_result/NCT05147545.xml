  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of circulating tumoral DNA makes it possible to study, without invasive procedures&#xD;
      or pathological studies, the tumoral DNA circulating in the blood of a patient and its&#xD;
      various alterations. In patients with colon-rectal cancer with resected tumor, circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA can be used as a predictive biomarker of metastatic relapse of cancer. However, the&#xD;
      routine extension of circulating tumoral DNA remains limited due to several difficulties. One&#xD;
      of the pifalls that circulating tumor DNA is greatly diluted by healthy circulating DNA from&#xD;
      non-tumor cells. The amount of healthy circulating DNA has been described as being influenced&#xD;
      by certain physiological parameters. The aim of the study is to increase knowledge on the&#xD;
      influence of physiological factors associated with sports activity and meal on the release&#xD;
      kinetics of circulating DNA.&#xD;

      20 subjects free of malignancy (Male-Female Ratio 2 to 1) the variation in the concentration&#xD;
      of DNA circulating between the value measured on an empty stomach after 1 hour of rest, then&#xD;
      at the end of each of the successive stages of moderate intensity physical effort: pedaling&#xD;
      15 minutes at 75 Watt then 100 Watt of the ergometer. Dosages will be repeated after 15, 30&#xD;
      and 60 minutes of recovery. After an hour of recovery, the subject will be asked to consume a&#xD;
      meal rich in fat. The circulating DNA will be measured 2 hours after the end of the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients with colon cancer will be enrolled for a two visit study. The first visit will be&#xD;
      planned at the first cycle of chemotherapy, before the chemotherapy. At this visit, the&#xD;
      influence of exercise on plasma concentrations of circulating free DNA will also be studied&#xD;
      in 40 patients with colon cancer. Free circulating DNA will be measured on an empty stomach&#xD;
      after 1 hour of rest, then immediately after low-intensity physical effort : pedaling 3&#xD;
      minutes at the 30 Watt level of the ergometer) and after 15, 30 and 60 minutes of recovery.&#xD;
      After an hour of recovery, the subject will be proposed to consume a meal rich in fat. The&#xD;
      circulating DNA will be measured 2 hours after the end of the meal. The second visit will be&#xD;
      planned at the first second of chemotherapy, before the chemotherapy. Free circulating DNA&#xD;
      will be measured on an empty stomach after 1 hour of rest, then immediately after&#xD;
      low-intensity physical effort : pedaling 3 min at the 30 Watt level of the ergometer, and&#xD;
      after 15, 30 and 60 minutes of recovery.&#xD;
