  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Across the United States, thousands of children and adolescents suffer from eating disorders.&#xD;
      Among young women alone, an estimated 2 to 4 percent are dealing with anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
      Anorexia nervosa also has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder and produces&#xD;
      a six-fold increased risk for death. Unfortunately, study shows that current treatments are&#xD;
      only successful with 25 percent of patients and no eating disorder prevention program has&#xD;
      been found to reduce future onset of anorexia nervosa. The goal of this study is to conduct a&#xD;
      highly innovative pilot study that will identify risk factors that predict future onset of&#xD;
      anorexia nervosa and investigate how the risk processes for anorexia nervosa are different&#xD;
      from the risk processes for bulimia nervosa. The proposed pilot study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare 30 healthy adolescent girls at high risk for anorexia nervosa to 30 healthy&#xD;
           adolescent girls at high risk for bulimia nervosa, and 30 healthy adolescent girls at&#xD;
           low risk for eating disorder in an effort to document risk processes that are present in&#xD;
           early adolescence before anorexia nervosa typically emerges.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test whether elevations in the hypothesized risk factors predict future onset of&#xD;
           anorexia nervosa over a four-year follow-up.&#xD;

      Data verification, preliminary analyses, and missing data. Data will be entered twice and&#xD;
      discrepancies corrected. Preliminary analyses will examine out-of-range values or unusual&#xD;
      distributions. Reaction time data that are +/-2 SD from the mean will be excluded from&#xD;
      analyses, following convention. All data will be analyzed regardless of missing follow-up&#xD;
      data. Missing data will be addressed using maximum likelihood estimation, multiple&#xD;
      imputation, or Type I and random right censoring. Maximum likelihood procedures, as well as&#xD;
      multiple imputation, can provide unbiased estimates even in instances of substantial&#xD;
      attrition (Shafer &amp; Graham, 2002). Multiple imputation procedures will follow best-practice&#xD;
      recommendations (Graham et al., 2007) and missing values will be imputed using the mice&#xD;
      package in R (van Buuren &amp; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). Observed and imputed datasets will be&#xD;
      compared to ensure they show similar distributions and will be analyzed separately and&#xD;
      results combined to obtain inferential tests based on average parameter estimates and&#xD;
      standard errors (Rubin, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image processing. MR scans will be performed with a 3T GE MR 750 scanner system. Blood&#xD;
      oxygen-level dependent, echo-planar images (BOLD-EPI) will be acquired with T2*-weighted&#xD;
      multiband (simultaneous multi-slice) acquisition sequence (TR=2000ms, TE=30ms, flip angle=53,&#xD;
      multiband factor=4, 2.2mm isotropic voxel size; 64 8x8 axial slices with no gap). Slices will&#xD;
      be tilted ~30 degrees relative to the AC-PC line. A rear-projection system will present&#xD;
      visual stimuli and a button box will assess behavioral responses. Timing and delivery of the&#xD;
      experimental tasks to the stimulus display equipment will be controlled via a MacBook Pro&#xD;
      using Psychtoolbox software run on MATLAB. Data analysis will be performed primarily using&#xD;
      Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12). We will either rescan participants for whom we&#xD;
      have poor data or recruit a replacement. Preprocessing will include rigid-body transformation&#xD;
      (realignment) and coregistration to the first functional image of each run. Images within&#xD;
      each run will be aligned to the first image of that run, and then aligned to the first image&#xD;
      from the first run, using a 6-parameter rigid body algorithm in SPM12. The MP-RAGE scan will&#xD;
      then be skull-stripped (with FSL's brain extraction tool) and normalized to a&#xD;
      high-resolution, T1-weighted template yielding a set of normalization parameters. Parameters&#xD;
      will then be applied to all functional and anatomical images, which will then be smoothed&#xD;
      with a 6-mm smoothing kernel. We considered using age-specific brain template (Wilke et al.,&#xD;
      2003), however, use in analyses with adolescents did not improve data quality. Statistical&#xD;
      comparisons will be computed using a general linear model in SPM12 at the subject level, then&#xD;
      imported to second level random effects models. A Monte Carlo simulation using true&#xD;
      smoothness will be used to compute voxel-wise and cluster-size thresholds for our data that&#xD;
      adjust for multiple comparisons to achieve a family-wise Type I error rate of 5%.We will&#xD;
      control for hunger and menstrual phase. We will correct fMRI scans for motion, scanner, and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid artifacts using independent component analysis (ICA) denoising (Kelly et&#xD;
      al., 2010). We will use Artifact Detection Toolbox (ART; Gabrieli Laboratory, McGovern&#xD;
      Institute for Brain Research, Cambridge MA) to detect spikes in global mean response and&#xD;
      motion outliers in the functional data. Motion parameters will be included as regressors in&#xD;
      the design matrix at individual-level analysis. To identify brain regions activated in&#xD;
      response to exposure to thin women and high-calorie foods, we will contrast fMRI BOLD&#xD;
      response during the presentation of thin women/high-calorie food images versus images of&#xD;
      average-weight women/glasses of water.To identify brain regions activated in response to food&#xD;
      receipt we will contrast BOLD response during receipt of milkshake verses tasteless solution.&#xD;
      To identify brain regions activated in response to anticipated milkshake receipt we will&#xD;
      contrast BOLD response during the cue for impending milkshake receipt versus the cue for&#xD;
      impending tasteless solution receipt. To identify brain activation in response to inhibitory&#xD;
      control to high-calorie foods, we will contrast successfully inhibited response to no-go&#xD;
      dessert trials versus no-go vegetable trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the delay discounting task, the rate at which the subjective value of a reward decays&#xD;
      with delay (TD rate) will be assessed through Mazur's (1987) equation: Vd = V/ (1+kD), where&#xD;
      Vd represents the discounted value at D delay, V is the undiscounted amounted, and k is the&#xD;
      estimated discounted parameter. High values of k indicate a preference for immediate rewards.&#xD;
      Vd will be derived by calculating individuals' indifference point -the value of the immediate&#xD;
      snack reward that is considered as attractive as the 40 units delayed snack reward.&#xD;
      Indifference points will be calculated for each delay and fit to the hyperbolic model of&#xD;
      delay discounting rate (k) and then log transformed (lnk).&#xD;
