      A community-based study to assess the effect of varying the time interval between doses on&#xD;
      the immunogenicity of an adjuvanted recombinant spike protein Covid-19 vaccine&#xD;
      (Spikogen/Covax-19) that has recently received emergency use authorisation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has caused millions of deaths globally. It has a particularly high&#xD;
      mortality rate in elderly people and those with chronic disease where mortality rates can be&#xD;
      as high as 20-30%. SARS-COV-2 vaccines remain a key priority to help fight the current&#xD;
      pandemic and prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks. COVID-19 vaccines have potential to&#xD;
      prevent symptomatic infections and may help reduce virus transmission. Covax-19/Spikogen is&#xD;
      the first full length recombinant spike protein vaccine in the world to receive emergency use&#xD;
      authorisation after it was shown in Phase 3 trials to be more than 60% effective at&#xD;
      preventing symptomatic infection with the delta variant. It has been reported for other&#xD;
      Covid-19 vaccines that a longer dose interval of up to 12 weeks between first and second&#xD;
      doses may further increase vaccine immunogenicity and protection. As only a 3-week dose&#xD;
      interval was tested in the clinical trials that supported Spikogen's authorisation, it will&#xD;
      be beneficial to test whether a longer dose interval than 3 weeks may have a favourable&#xD;
      effect on vaccine immunogenicity and thereby protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single positive-stranded RNA virus, with one genome encoding a&#xD;
      non-structural replicase polyprotein and structural proteins including spike (S), envelope&#xD;
      (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Neutralizing antibodies are directed against&#xD;
      the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD). T cells directed against the S protein may also&#xD;
      play a role in protection and virus clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spikogen, also known under the Covax-19 tradename in Australia, is based on recombinant&#xD;
      SARS-COV-2 spike protein manufactured in insect cells that is formulated with a combination&#xD;
      adjuvant known as Advax-CpG55.2. Insect cell expression of recombinant protein is a&#xD;
      well-established vaccine manufacturing approach that is used, for example, in production of&#xD;
      an influenza vaccine (Flublok®) in USA and a human papillomavirus vaccine that is marketed&#xD;
      globally including in Australia (Cervarix®). The purified recombinant protein needs to be&#xD;
      formulated with Advax-CpG55.2 adjuvant to ensure a sufficiently robust immune response&#xD;
      enabling the vaccine to produce protective levels of immunity. Advax-CpG55.2 has two&#xD;
      components, one a natural plant sugar called inulin and the second a short synthetic polymer&#xD;
      made up of deoxynucleotides, known as CpG55.2 oligonucleotide. Advax-CpG adjuvant has been&#xD;
      used in multiple human clinical trials of influenza and Covid-19 vaccines and has been found&#xD;
      to be safe and well tolerated just causing a mild increase in local injection site soreness&#xD;
      when compared to a saline injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spikogen vaccine is designed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection by generation of&#xD;
      antibodies and memory cells against the spike protein. It has been shown to provide&#xD;
      protection against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in hamster, ferret and monkey models. In the&#xD;
      hamster model it was shown to provide protection against the original Wuhan strain as well as&#xD;
      against the more recent beta and Delta variant strains. In preclinical studies it was well&#xD;
      tolerated and caused no major adverse reactions. Following successful completion of a Phase 2&#xD;
      trial in 400 adult participants that confirmed its safety and immunogenicity, a Phase 3&#xD;
      clinical trial was undertaken in Iran involving 16,876 participants randomised 3:1 to receive&#xD;
      active vaccine or placebo using two intramuscular doses administered 3 weeks apart. Spikogen&#xD;
      vaccine successfully met its prespecified primary efficacy endpoint established by the&#xD;
      Iranian FDA, namely demonstration of &gt;60% protection against symptomatic PCR-confirmed&#xD;
      infection. On this basis of efficacy shown in the Phase 3 trial plus safety data consistent&#xD;
      with the findings of the earlier Phase 2 trial, Spikogen vaccine received emergency use&#xD;
      authorisation by the Iranian FDA in October 2021, making it the first such vaccine to receive&#xD;
      such authorisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now planned to undertake a community-based clinical trial in Australia to determine,&#xD;
      based on measurement of anti-spike antibody levels, the optimal time between the two doses&#xD;
      when the vaccine is used as a primary immunisation regimen in vaccine-naive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for schedule of administration The aim is to determine the best dose interval for a&#xD;
      course of 2 doses in vaccine naïve individuals. This trial will administer two doses of&#xD;
      vaccine to vaccine-naïve individuals at variable intervals (3, 4, 5 or 6 weeks) to assess the&#xD;
      effect of timing of the second vaccine dose on anti-spike protein antibody production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for selection of doses In the Phase 3 clinical trial, two 25 ug doses of vaccine&#xD;
      given 3 weeks apart provided 60-65% protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with&#xD;
      the delta strain. This trial will test the same dose of the authorised vaccine as used in the&#xD;
      pivotal Phase 3 trial but just with a varying time window between the two doses.&#xD;
