    <textblock>
      This study was designed to investigate the bioequivalence of the test and reference products&#xD;
      when administered as single oral doses in two consecutive study periods, under fasting&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single 300 mg dose of the test (T) and of the reference (R) products will be administered&#xD;
      to the study subjects in two consecutive periods, according to a randomised 2-sequence&#xD;
      cross-over design. A wash-out interval of at least 10 days will elapse between the two&#xD;
      administrations. The two investigational products will be administered with 240 mL of still&#xD;
      mineral water on day 1 of the two study periods, at 08:00±1 h after an overnight fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the bioequivalence of the test and reference products when administered as&#xD;
