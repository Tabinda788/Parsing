  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cough is one of the most common medical complaints accounting for as many as 30 million&#xD;
      clinical visits per year. It is the single most prevalent symptom on presentation to a&#xD;
      physician's office. Up to 40% of these complaints result in a referral to a pulmonologist.&#xD;
      Although, the cough is an essential defense mechanism, still, chronic cough may cause&#xD;
      significant morbidity and substantially affect the quality of life and psychosocial&#xD;
      wellbeing.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, the prevalence of acute cough is 9 to 64%, whereas chronic cough is &gt;10% in most&#xD;
      countries or regions, ranging from 7.2%-33%. In Pakistan, a few studies have examined chronic&#xD;
      cough resulting from specific occupations, such as those involving brick kilns, textile work,&#xD;
      or gem cutting. Additionally, 15.8% of subjects in a periurban area of Karachi City, Pakistan&#xD;
      with cough lasting ≥ 2 weeks were found to have pulmonary TB. Overall, to estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence and incidence of different coughs, there is no data available based on the local&#xD;
      population, and the data assessing the quality of life of patients with different coughs is&#xD;
      not available. Locally, few studies were conducted on cough syrups with a small sample size.&#xD;
      However, no real data is available for the symptomatic management of cough about the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life related to different coughs. The current study is designed to&#xD;
      assess the response of different strengths of Syrup Hydryllin ( Syrup Hydryllin &amp; Hydryllin&#xD;
      Sugar-Free (Diphenhydramine, Ammonium Chloride, Menthol, Aminophylline) and Syrup Hydryllin&#xD;
      DM (Dextromethorphan &amp; Diphenhydramine) in the symptomatic management of cough in routine&#xD;
      practice by physicians. The study's main objective is to assess the quality of life of the&#xD;
      subjects suffering from the different types of cough.&#xD;
