  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal outlines the steps required for the creation of a pilot database of EEG&#xD;
      recordings and de-identified medical records from patients internally referred within the&#xD;
      UNMH Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. The UNMH EEG Corpus would be the first database of its&#xD;
      kind. Other public databases contain either patient EEG signals or medical records, but&#xD;
      without both kinds of information, it is impossible to relate pre-treatment neurobiomarkers&#xD;
      with post-treatment prognosis. The database will also contain information that can improve&#xD;
      seizure localization based off of scalp and intracranial EEG, and the requisite data for the&#xD;
      creation of algorithms that forecast seizure activity; a development that could ultimately&#xD;
      lead to novel responsive neural stimulation procedures that suppress seizures before they&#xD;
      begin.&#xD;

      Retrospective De-identified EEG and Clinical Database Creation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed database (UNMH EEG corpus) will be created in stages and designed to increase in&#xD;
      complexity and functionality given future funding and tool development. The initial scope for&#xD;
      this project includes the construction of a relational database that links patient&#xD;
      demographic data (medical records, EEG study number, date of birth) which will be linked to&#xD;
      the study number. This list will be kept for 6 years from the completion of study and will be&#xD;
      stored in locked office cabinet as a paper form (source documentation) and password protected&#xD;
      computer in locked office (electronic version). Then, the rest of the data collection will&#xD;
      include algorithmically de-identified clinical reports (e.g. progress notes), recording&#xD;
      meta-data (e.g. montage configuration), and de-identified clinical EEG with only study number&#xD;
      without PHI. Future work beyond the scope of this pilot project will involve: annotating the&#xD;
      EEG trace with the timing and type of seizure (or artifact), extracting medication history&#xD;
      from the patient records, standardizing notes on treatment history and outcome, review that&#xD;
      ePHI has been removed, and dissemination. A full patient assessment can also include MRI, MEG&#xD;
      and PET scans and a final database should also include these valuable images. The creation of&#xD;
      the pilot UNMH EEG corpus will focus on the subset of patients internally referred within&#xD;
      UNMH for whom an EEG was performed, a treatment was provided, and a follow up assessment&#xD;
      occurred. This inclusion criteria will guarantee that the minimum data is present to&#xD;
      statistically relate pre-treatment EEG with post-treatment prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of De-identified Data Retrospectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame: 1) from current up to August 8, 2007 when Nihon Kodhen Neuroworkbench was started&#xD;
      at UNM, 2) From the start of study, each year, we will add previous year's de-identified data&#xD;
      to the database until the last dataset of 2027. For example, in January to Februrary 2023, we&#xD;
      will add 2022 data to the database. We will add previous year's data to the database until&#xD;
      2028 with the last dataset till 2027.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will generate randomized de-identified study number by computer programing. We will create&#xD;
      the secure table of de-identified study number to link patient's PHI (medical record number,&#xD;
      EEG study number, Date of Birth). This table will be stored in the locked cabinet in PIs'&#xD;
      office. Also, the electronic version will be stored in HSC password protected computer under&#xD;
      HSC IT secured drive with only access by PIs and study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the study number is generated, all the de-identified data will be stored under the study&#xD;
      number so that no PHI is present in any of research data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will only extract the data from the patients who are 18 years or older at the time of EEG&#xD;
      obtained. We will exclude any vulnerable groups or information. Please see below for&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Children under age of 18 years old will be excluded. Since,&#xD;
      there is no informed consent or direct interaction with the patient in this retrospective&#xD;
      data analysis, the patient of any particular ethnic/ racial/ primary language will not be&#xD;
      screened nor targeted. Also, there will be no particular exclusion for Spanish speaking&#xD;
      patients for the above reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will all de-identify EEG data from the clinical EEG database (i.e. Neuroworkbench of Nihon&#xD;
      Kodhen EEG system) and import these to password protected secure study server in PI's HSC IT&#xD;
      secured drive domain. There will be no video data of EEG since video of patient can be easily&#xD;
      identify the patient's information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Information: each patient's Neurology notes (History and Physical, Neurology&#xD;
      Progress Note, Neurology Consultation Note, Neurology Clinic note, Neurology Discharge&#xD;
      Summary, Neurodiagnostic Report of EEG results, Neuroimaging studies (brain MRI, brain PET,&#xD;
      brain MEG), and Patient's Medication List of Anti-seizure medication (ASM) will be pulled.&#xD;
      These clinical documentations will be de-identified (removing all PHI) and linked to the&#xD;
      study number. After the de-identification and link to study number, the clinical information&#xD;
      will be stored in password protected secure study server with de-identified EEG data. While&#xD;
      we are creating automated de-identification method, we will manually extract the data and&#xD;
      manually de-identify them. Once the automated process is established, we will also perform&#xD;
      quality check with manual and automated process comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, all data (the EEG-BIDS files, the SQL database, and the Excel sheet) will be&#xD;
      stored on an internal hard drive within a UNM HSC IT managed desktop PC, physically located&#xD;
      in Dr. Sam McKenzie's office in Rm 209A in RGFH. The PC is on the UNM HSC network and the&#xD;
      computer runs the UNM HSC mirror of Windows 10. The room is always locked and the PC requires&#xD;
      password log in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the EEG-BIDS file format to store all data and organize the database. This file&#xD;
      format specifies a path structure tree with particular nomenclature (Figure 1). Each patient&#xD;
      is assigned a directory containing subdirectories for each session and data modality. For&#xD;
      non-identifying details about the patient demographics and recording details, information&#xD;
      will be saved in two file types: a *.tsv file for data values and a *.json file for&#xD;
      descriptive metadata. EEG files with de-identification will be downsampled to 250 Hz, for&#xD;
      hard drive storage efficacy, and saved into the European Data Format. Also accompanying the&#xD;
      EDF EEG file will be a 'coordinates' file which specifies the location of anatomical&#xD;
      landmarks used for montage placement. Another 'events' file will contain annotations of&#xD;
      events observed by clinicians in the EEG. This data will be imported from the original Nihon&#xD;
      Kohden annotated dataset using the Python MNE toolbox1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this file structure we will also save text files with de-identified clinical notes&#xD;
      imported from Cerner Millennium detailing medication, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.&#xD;
      Non-identifying patient data will additionally be stored in a SQL database with a randomized&#xD;
      patient identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Excel sheet will store random patient identification number (used in the EEG-BIDS file and&#xD;
      in the SQL database) and the corresponding patient identifying number for subsequent&#xD;
      re-identification if needed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will screen with UNMH EEG database, Nihon Kohden Neuroworkbench first. After&#xD;
             meeting all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we will access the Cerner Powerchart&#xD;
             (UNMH EMR) for the rest of the clinical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years old or older. If the patient's age is over 89, we will aggregated them to age&#xD;
             90 or older so that the patient cannot be identified. Also, all the EEG data will be&#xD;
             de-identified and only show the year of the study performed instead of the exact study&#xD;
             date to reduce the risk of identification. Of note, we perform over few thousands of&#xD;
             EEG studies per year and it will be almost impossible to identify the patient based on&#xD;
             the study year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children under age of 18 years old will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mismatched patients between EEG database and EMR&#xD;
