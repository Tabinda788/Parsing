      Americans who work outdoors are exposed to an extreme amount of solar ultraviolet radiation&#xD;
      over a lifetime that substantially increases their risk for developing skin cancer. In Phase&#xD;
      I, the feasibility of a virtual learning environment (VLE) for distributing our effective Sun&#xD;
      Safe Workplaces (SSW) intervention to American employers will be established with input from&#xD;
      senior managers and Hispanic and African American outdoor workers and development and&#xD;
      evaluation of a prototype of the SSW Works VLE. In Phase II, the full SSW Works will be&#xD;
      produced and tested for effectiveness at improving outdoor workers' sun protection in a&#xD;
      randomized trial enrolling employers nationwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Americans who work outdoors are exposed to an extreme amount of solar ultraviolet radiation&#xD;
      (UV) over a lifetime that substantially increases their risk for developing skin cancer.&#xD;
      Annually, skin cancer is diagnosed in over 3.5 million U.S. adults, melanoma kills nearly&#xD;
      7,000 Americans, and treatment costs at least $8 billion. The U.S. Surgeon General has&#xD;
      identified occupational sun safety as a national priority. Our team has spent the past two&#xD;
      decades developing a successful comprehensive approach to occupational sun protection in 5&#xD;
      trials funded largely by the National Cancer Institute. Sun Safe Workplaces (SSW) combines&#xD;
      policy and education to increase workplace actions on sun safety and employee sun protection&#xD;
      practices. In this SBIR Fast-Track application, we will develop a virtual learning&#xD;
      environment (VLE), SSW Works, to distribute the SSW program to American workplaces. It will&#xD;
      be comprised of a database, content management (interactive toolbox), and media platform&#xD;
      (trackable training) that tailors the SSW program to management's readiness to innovate on&#xD;
      sun safety based Diffusion of Innovations Theory. SSW Works will better integrate SSW into&#xD;
      safety training by improving appropriateness for Hispanic and African American workers and&#xD;
      conforming with the latest learning management systems technology (LMS). Strong scientific&#xD;
      premise comes from the published literature and our 5 previous studies that demonstrated SSW&#xD;
      is feasible and effective in public works, public safety, and outdoor recreation workplaces.&#xD;
      The Phase I specific aims will establish the feasibility of SSW Works by 1) creating and&#xD;
      validating an algorithm to tailor resources and implementation strategies to employers'&#xD;
      stages in the diffusion of innovations process; 2) identifying unique attitudes, barriers,&#xD;
      and practices related to sun safety among Hispanic and African American employees in focus&#xD;
      group discussion and adjusting the SSW content; and 3) creating a prototype of the SSW Works&#xD;
      VLE, including inputs, staging algorithm and tailored report, employee training compatible&#xD;
      with a popular LMS, and storyboards of brief videos for managers and employees and testing it&#xD;
      for feasibility and usability with managers and Hispanic and African American outdoor&#xD;
      workers, and confirming that the training can operate within a popular LMS. In Phase II, SSW&#xD;
      Works will be fully programmed and tested for effectiveness by achieving the specific aims&#xD;
      of: 1) producing the full SSW Works, in English and Spanish, for distribution of the&#xD;
      evidence-based SSW and 2) conducting a randomized controlled trial with 20 workplaces&#xD;
      evaluating impact of SSW distributed over the SSW Works on employees' sun safety practices&#xD;
      (primary outcome). The primary hypothesis is: compared to employers in the minimal&#xD;
      information control group, employers assigned to receive SSW Works will have employees that&#xD;
      practice more sun protection at posttest. The SBIR Fast-Track research is significant and&#xD;
      innovative. SSW Works will have high impact and commercial potential because outdoor&#xD;
      workforce is large and at very high risk for skin cancer, improving sun safety will reduce&#xD;
      health care costs and save lives, and there are few commercial competitors.&#xD;
