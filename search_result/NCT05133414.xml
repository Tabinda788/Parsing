  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm condition that affects over 3% of the total&#xD;
      population. AF can lead to serious health problems such as heart failure or stroke and can&#xD;
      also cause troublesome symptoms in some people. Although many advances have been made, there&#xD;
      remains a pressing need to improvement treatment of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is increasingly recognised that the brain and nerves can influence the electrical activity&#xD;
      of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this research involves studying a new nerve target (Subclavian ansae) that is&#xD;
      connected to the heart and can be a potential target for future treatment of AF. This nerve&#xD;
      lies around an area close to an artery that runs to participant's left arm called left&#xD;
      subclavian artery which can be approached via leg (key hole). The investigators aim to&#xD;
      conduct this study in patients who have been referred for first time AF ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common and significant medical problem that affects&#xD;
      approximately 3% of the population. There is increasing recognition of the importance of&#xD;
      interactions between the heart and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of arrhythmias. The role of ANS in the onset and maintenance of AF is thought to be related&#xD;
      to autonomic imbalance. Several studies have experimented the use of autonomic modification&#xD;
      in AF and identified potential targets for therapy ( for example: ganglionic plexi ablation,&#xD;
      renal denervation, stellate ganglion block, and low level vagal nerve stimulation). However,&#xD;
      some targets like stellate ganglion block/sympathectomy will have off-target side-effects.&#xD;
      Easily accessible, minimally invasive, and selective targets for neuromodulation are of great&#xD;
      interest for development of novel therapy in the management of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subclavian ansae was first described in 1864 by Vieussens and is a nerve cord that forms&#xD;
      a loop inferiorly around the subclavian artery and connects the inferior cervical ganglion&#xD;
      and middle cervical ganglia.According to literature cardiac-related preganglionic fibers&#xD;
      arising from the thoracic cord traverse up the paravertebral chain through the T1-T2 region,&#xD;
      some making synaptic contact with postganglionic neurons in the stellate with others&#xD;
      projecting through the subclavian ansae to more distal intrathoracic ganglia (middle&#xD;
      cervical, mediastinal, and intrinsic). As such the ansa subclavia and the T1-T2 region of the&#xD;
      paravertebral chain are critical nexus points for sympathetic nerve traffic to and afferent&#xD;
      projections of the heart. Based on structure and function consideration, both sites are&#xD;
      potential targets for cardiac neuromodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have showed that stimulation of the subclavian ansae produces&#xD;
      reproducible increases in cardiac rate, contractility and conduction velocity. Denervation of&#xD;
      the subclavian ansae followed by stellate ganglion stimulation results in no change in&#xD;
      cardiac indices confirming the nodal intervention point for cardiac sympathetic traffic. Due&#xD;
      to the close anatomical proximity, stimulation of subclavian ansae should be possible via the&#xD;
      subclavian artery which is accessible by percutaneous approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to introduce a percutaneous approach for identification and&#xD;
      stimulation of subclavian ansae (sympathetic nerves) which exclusively innervate the heart&#xD;
      and therefore stimulation will result in in changes in human cardiac haemodynamic and&#xD;
      electrophysiological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the human cardiac haemodynamics and&#xD;
      electrophysiological response to left subclavian ansae stimulation (SAS) in patients with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine appropriate stimulation parameters to selectively target subclavian ansae via&#xD;
      percutaneous transarterial approach and to confirm safety of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred by Electrophysiologist for catheter ablation of paroxysmal AF (PAF) will be&#xD;
      recruited. Participants will undergo consenting for the procedure and their involvement in&#xD;
      the research study. The procedure will be performed under general anaesthesia. A stimulation&#xD;
      wire will be passed into the left subclavian artery via the femoral arterial access. Further&#xD;
      wires will be passed (via venous access) to the left top chamber of the heart which will then&#xD;
      be used for 3D guided AF ablation after stimulation protocol. Study measurements will be&#xD;
      gathered before and after the stimulation subclavian ansae. This will be followed by AF&#xD;
      ablation (pulmonary vein isolation) and direct current cardioversion (DCCV) [if required] as&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
