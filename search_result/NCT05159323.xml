    <textblock>
      This project intends to prospectively collect patients with suspected breast malignant tumors&#xD;
      by ultrasound or mammography. After routine MRI scanning, all patients underwent diffusion&#xD;
      spectrum imaging (DSI) sequence scanning. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) breast&#xD;
      cancer was confirmed by surgery or biopsy. (2) pathologically diagnosis of estrogen receptor&#xD;
      (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2), Ki-67, and&#xD;
      lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) status in breast cancer. (3) routine MRI and DSI scans were&#xD;
      performed within one week before the pathologic examination. The exclusion criteria were as&#xD;
      follows: (1) patients who had received treatment before DSI scanning; (2) patients who&#xD;
      underwent breast tumor biopsy within two weeks before DSI image acquisition; (3) pathology&#xD;
      results of breast masses were other diseases besides breast cancer. (4) post-processing of&#xD;
      DSI data cannot be performed due to poor image quality, such as motion artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast MRI data were collected on a 3T MR scanner (Magnetom skyra, Siemens Healthcare,&#xD;
      Erlangen, Germany). All participants used standardized breast MRI scanning schemes, including&#xD;
      T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), T1 weighted imaging (T1WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI),&#xD;
      DSI, and contrast dynamic enhancement (DCE). A total of 22 GSI quantitative parameters were&#xD;
      derived from NeudiLab software that is based on the open-source platform DIPY (diffusion&#xD;
      imaging in Python, http://nipy.org/dipy). The correlation between DSI quantitative parameters&#xD;
      and pathological indexes (i.e., ER, PR, HER-2, Ki-67, and LVI) was evaluated by Spearman&#xD;
      correlation analysis. The independent predictors of GSI quantitative parameters for different&#xD;
      pathologic characteristics discrimination in breast cancer were determined by the logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis. The predictive performance of DSI quantitative parameters for difference&#xD;
      pathologic classifications was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves&#xD;
      and their respective area under the curves (AUCs).&#xD;
