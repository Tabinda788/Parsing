  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketone bodies are a fuel source and signaling molecule that are produced by the body during&#xD;
      prolonged fasting or if an individuals consistently eats a low-carbohydrate &quot;keto&quot; diet.&#xD;
      Blood ketones can be used as a source of energy by the body, but they may also act as signals&#xD;
      that impact the functioning of different cells in the body. Recently, the availability of&#xD;
      ketone supplements that can be taken orally allows for raising blood ketones without having&#xD;
      to fast or eat a &quot;keto&quot; diet. Our studies and those of other researchers have shown that&#xD;
      ketone supplementation can lower blood sugar without having to make any other dietary&#xD;
      changes. Oral ingestion of ketones may therefore be an effective strategy to improve blood&#xD;
      sugar control and influence how cells function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine if consuming a ketone supplement 3 times per&#xD;
      day (before meals) for 14 days lowers blood sugar and impacts how the body's cells function.&#xD;
      The results of this study will be used to guide future recommendations on the utility of&#xD;
      ketone supplements for improving health in individuals with, or at elevated risk of, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
