  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the known efficacy of pharmacotherapy (i.e. antidepressants) and psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions in treating depressive disorders, research evidence suggests that 20% to 40% of&#xD;
      patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not respond adequately to such treatments.&#xD;
      These patients are diagnosed with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), and are sometimes&#xD;
      treated with Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, about 10-30% of TRD patients do not&#xD;
      respond to ECT, and are thus diagnosed with Ultra-Resistant Depression (URD). Using an open&#xD;
      label pilot study involving subjects with URD, this trial aims to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and clinical effects of intranasal ketamine (IN) treatment for this population.&#xD;
      Intranasal ketamine (IN) treatment approach has shown promising therapeutic outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with TRD, but has not yet been studied on patients with URD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is a fast-acting anesthetic that can have stimulant effects when taken at low doses.&#xD;
      It acts as a non-competitive high-affinity N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist&#xD;
      that stimulates synaptic glutamate release and blocks extra-synaptic NMDA receptors. This&#xD;
      mechanism of action mediates excitatory synaptic transmission through the central nervous&#xD;
      system and therefore results in robust antidepressant effects. Administering intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      ketamine to patients with TRD has shown to produce rapid antidepressant effects.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, delivering IV ketamine to patients can be challenging since it requires&#xD;
      specialized expertise and equipment. A promising alternative that preserves IV ketamine's&#xD;
      rapid onset of therapeutic action while minimizing inconvenience and discomfort is intranasal&#xD;
      drug delivery (IN). This current proof-of-concept clinical trial is an open label pilot study&#xD;
      on patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression who did not respond to, or did not&#xD;
      tolerate, an acute course of convulsive therapy. The trial aims to study the clinical effects&#xD;
      of IN ketamine on treating URD. Using a combination of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) neurophysiological tools with electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG),&#xD;
      this trial also aims to explore biomarkers of ketamine's antidepressant effect by examining&#xD;
      ketamine's action on NMDA neurotransmission. Investigating the impact of ketamine on cortical&#xD;
      excitation and inhibition could provide insight into the role of NMDA receptors in cortical&#xD;
      physiology, and therefore determine potential predictors of clinical response for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To test the safety and tolerability of IN ketamine in patients with URD who did&#xD;
      not respond to/tolerate an acute course of ECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: IN ketamine will be safe and well tolerated in patients with URD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To test the clinical effects of IN ketamine patients with URD who did not&#xD;
      respond to/tolerate an acute course of ECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: IN ketamine will result in improvement in depressive symptoms, suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, and quality of life measures (compared to scores from baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To investigate the impact of ketamine on cortical excitation via intracortical&#xD;
      facilitation (ICF) and cortical inhibition via short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI)&#xD;
      paradigms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: IN ketamine will result in neurophysiological changes as measured by TMS-EMG&#xD;
      and EEG&#xD;

    <description>A sterile form of ketamine will be administered intranasally twice weekly for four weeks. Dosing schedule will be determined based on patient's weight using a specialized formula. Patients will be started at the lowest dose during the first treatment session. Dose will be titrated further to therapeutic dose in the following sessions. The dose will be adjusted if patients do not tolerate full therapeutic doses. After receiving the second treatment of each week, participants will be seen by a study physician to determine dosing for the following week. Patients will be monitored by trained personnel for the full duration of the 2 hour supervision period. Vital signs and physical symptoms will be monitored consistently and measurements taken every 30 minutes. Appropriate medications will be provided to manage treatment-related side effects and any adverse events. Labetalol will be used in the management of treatment-related transient hypertension as needed.</description>
