  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with different types of advanced cancer (solid tumours) that are&#xD;
      accessible for injection. People for whom previous treatment was not successful or for whom&#xD;
      no other treatment options exist can join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tests a medicine called BI 1831169 alone and in combination with another medicine&#xD;
      called ezabenlimab. BI 1831169 and ezabenlimab may help the immune system fight cancer. In&#xD;
      this study, BI 1831169 is given to people for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts. The purpose of the first part is to find the highest dose of BI&#xD;
      1831169 the participants can tolerate. Part 1 also tests whether BI 1831169 can make the&#xD;
      tumours shrink. The purpose of the second part is to find the highest dose of BI 1831169 in&#xD;
      combination with ezabenlimab that the participants can tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants get BI 1831169 as an injection into the tumour, or as an infusion into the vein,&#xD;
      or both (injection and infusion). Ezabenlimab is given as an infusion into a vein.&#xD;
      Participants get the medicines about every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who get BI 1831169 alone receive this treatment for up to 3 months. Participants&#xD;
      who take the combination treatment, get BI 1831169 for up to 3 months and ezabenlimab for up&#xD;
      to a year. Study doctors regularly check the participants' health and monitor the tumours.&#xD;
      The doctors also take note of any unwanted effects that could have been caused by BI 1831169&#xD;
      or ezabenlimab.&#xD;
