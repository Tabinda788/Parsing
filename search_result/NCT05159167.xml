  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Baduanjinï¼Œa type of Qigong which belongs to aerobic exercise, is very popular in China. There&#xD;
      is increasing evidence to support its positive effects on health outcomes in various groups&#xD;
      of people with physical and mental disorders. In college students, it may enhance cardio&#xD;
      respiratory function, lower limb function, and flexibility compared with usual exercise.&#xD;
      However, there is no previous relevant randomized controlled trials on the health promoting&#xD;
      effects of Baduanjin exercise in targeted fatigued lung cancer patients. Lung cancer&#xD;
      survivors can experience fatigue due to multiple reasons that can strongly impact their&#xD;
      quality of life throughout the remainder of their life. Therefore, this randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial in China was designed to assess the health promoting effects of Baduanjin exercise in&#xD;
      fatigued lung cancer patients with the expectation of improvement in physical and&#xD;
      psychological health.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the intervention group received two months of Baduanjin exercise training provided by the specialist coach 3 days per week in Hubei Cancer Hospital, and they were also required to do Baduanjin exercise at home for the remaining 4 days each week for at least 20 min per day. All the participants are requested to monitor and record adverse effects during their exercise sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group were requested to maintain their original daily physical activity for no less than 20 min per day over the following 6-month period and record their daily activity at home by themselves. These data were collected by a researcher during the participants' time in the study and at the 6-month follow-up at the hospital. After the 6-month follow-up, the participants were provided with 1-month professional Baduanjin exercise guidance by the trial's specialist coach for free if they wished.</description>
