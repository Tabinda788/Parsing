      SUSINCHAIN investigates the impact of exposing families (an adult and a child) to meals with&#xD;
      alternative proteins (insect-based or plant-based products) on dietary pattern, intake of&#xD;
      meat and total protein.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to investigate the impact of exposing paired&#xD;
      participants (an adult and a child) to dinner menus of meals with alternative proteins&#xD;
      (insect-based or plant-based products) on dietary pattern, intake of meat, and protein over a&#xD;
      six-week intervention period. The insect-based menu is the experimental exposure and the&#xD;
      plant-based menu is the positive control menu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that test menus of meals with alternative proteins will replace the meat&#xD;
      consumed during dinner, resulting in maintaining the total protein intake while replacing 20%&#xD;
      of the meat protein with alternative protein on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assumption is that the insect-based menus will replace meat protein similarly or to a&#xD;
      larger extend than the positive control group receiving the comparable plant-based menu. The&#xD;
      inclusion of the positive control group allows us to isolate the specific impact of exposure&#xD;
      to insect-based menu from the exposure to dietary change of more familiar plant-based&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized intervention trial recruiting 80 paired participants of an adult&#xD;
      and a child age 8-10 year living together in a family, alone or with other family members.&#xD;
      The paired participants are randomized to receive one of two menus of meals with alternative&#xD;
      proteins, either plant-based or insect-based. Measurements (dietary records, questionnaires)&#xD;
      as well as biological samples (urine collection) are taken primarily at baseline (week 0) and&#xD;
      endline (week 6).&#xD;

        This study recruits families in which one adult and one child are enrolled as participants.&#xD;
