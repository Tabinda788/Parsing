      The study seeks to assess the safety and define blood and tissue benchmark concentrations of&#xD;
      Tenofovir (TFV) and Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in Cisgender women using directly observed&#xD;
      tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-emtricitabine (TAF-FTC) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). These&#xD;
      data will help accurate interpretation of efficacy results obtained in HIV prevention trials&#xD;
      and programs in cisgender women.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, three-arm, directly observed therapy, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      study. HIV-uninfected non-pregnant cisgender women will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dosing&#xD;
      frequencies of directly observed therapy (DOT) TAF-FTC PrEP, to help differentiate poor and&#xD;
      modest from perfect adherence. The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the safety of TAF-FTC-based PrEP in HIV-unifected cisgender women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To define the cisgender women-specific expected blood concentrations and&#xD;
           dose-proportionality for TFV-DP in DBS and PBMCs using directly observed TAF-FTC therapy&#xD;
           at 2, 4, 7 doses per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a model to predict adherence rate to TAF-FTC by level of TFV-DP in DBS for&#xD;
           cisgender women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be the first to define TAF-FTC-based PrEP adherence-blood concentration&#xD;
      thresholds for African cisgender women, a priority population for HIV prevention. The&#xD;
      findings will guide accurate interpretation of safety, adherence, and efficacy of planned or&#xD;
      ongoing HIV prevention trials in African women.&#xD;

             potential participants without a smatphone may be enrolled in the study if&#xD;
             investigator determines that the particiapnt resides within reasonable distance from&#xD;
