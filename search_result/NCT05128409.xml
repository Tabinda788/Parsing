  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XKH001is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody for subcutaneous injection. XKH001&#xD;
      specifically blocks interleukin-25 from binding to its receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) of single ascending doses of&#xD;
      XKH001 injection following subcutaneous administration&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 single ascending dose study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of XKH001 in&#xD;
      approximately 35 adult healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a Screening Period (up to 21 days), an in-house Treatment Period,&#xD;
      and a follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects who signed the informed consent form (ICF) will be sequentially enrolled&#xD;
      into one of the 5 dose cohorts: 0.5, 1.67, 3.34, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg. Three subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in 0.5 mg/kg cohort (Cohort 1). All subjects in Cohort 1 will receive open-label&#xD;
      XKH001. One sentinel participant will be dosed 48 hours prior to dosing the remainders of&#xD;
      cohort 1. Eight subjects will be enrolled in the remaining dose cohorts (Cohort 2-5) and&#xD;
      randomized to XKH001 or placebo after baseline evaluations are completed. Subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical research center the day before the administration of study drug (Day&#xD;
      -1) For the study treatment of Cohort 2-5, the Investigator and other clinical center staff&#xD;
      will be blinded. Any off-site staff who are unblinded will have no contact with the study&#xD;
      participants. Two sentinel participants (randomized in a 1:1 ratio) will be dosed 48 hours&#xD;
      prior to dosing the remainders of Cohort 2-5 (n=6, randomized in a 5:1 ratio). Subjects will&#xD;
      be given a single dose of XKH001 or placebo (Cohort 2-5) on Day 1. After dosing, all subjects&#xD;
      will be followed as inpatients through day 4. After discharge, all subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for safety for 8 weeks and required to return to the clinical center for safety visits at the&#xD;
      time points specified in Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety monitoring committee (SMC) will evaluate all available safety, and tolerability data&#xD;
      within the first 21 days after the administration of the study drug. Escalation to the next&#xD;
      higher dose level will stop if any of the stopping criteria defined in Section 7.1.2 is met.&#xD;
      All subjects will have cleared the 21-day observation period at any given dose level before&#xD;
      subjects are allowed to enroll at the next higher dose level. The dose level may be modified&#xD;
      based on the emerging safety and PK data from this study via submission of a protocol&#xD;
      amendment.&#xD;
