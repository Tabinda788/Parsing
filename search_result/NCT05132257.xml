      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preterm neonate, especially the low birth weight infant, is at a greater risk to develop&#xD;
      disorders in multiple organ systems because of immaturity. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)&#xD;
      is a disorder of the developing retina of low birth weight preterm infants that has the&#xD;
      potential to lead to blindness. Although the pathogenesis and etiology of ROP remains&#xD;
      unclear, many causative factors have been proposed. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#xD;
      is an important regulator of angiogenesis in fetal life. In humans, polymorphisms in the VEGF&#xD;
      gene have been reportedly associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and age-related&#xD;
      degeneration. These retinal diseases might share the disease process of vasculopathy with&#xD;
      ROP. Besides risk factors specifically associated with preterm birth, the activation of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines has been suggested to contribute to ROP development. Tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor (TNF)-α is one of the major cytokines in inflammation. Its expression was&#xD;
      up-regulated in retinal neovascularization in animal models and proliferative eye diseases in&#xD;
      humans. Many researchers suggest that TNF-α may affect retinal angiogenesis and predispose&#xD;
      preterm infants for later development of ROP. Recent studies showed the possible correlation&#xD;
      between ROP and polymorphism in VEGF (-460 T/C, +936 C/T, -634 G/C, and -2578 C/A), or TNF-α&#xD;
      (-308 G/A). However, these studies focused on western populations. In our study, we will&#xD;
      analyze the relationships among severity, treatment outcomes, and genetic polymorphism&#xD;
      findings in ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim and Goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the correlation between genetic polymorphism and ROP development&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the possibility if there are any specific genetic polymorphisms that lead to&#xD;
           poor outcome or recurrence of ROP after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Participants: We plan to recruit the children born at Linkou and Taipei branches&#xD;
      of Chung Gung Memorial Hospital in 2009-2018, who are willing to undergo series of&#xD;
      ophthalmologic examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: April, 2021 to March, 2024. A prospective cohort study Inclusion criteria: All&#xD;
      children who were born at Linkou and Taipei branches of Chung Gung Memorial Hospital during&#xD;
      the period of 2009 to 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: If the parents were not willing to participate the study, or the medical&#xD;
      records were not complete, or the follow period was less than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated patients' numbers: about 500 babies/3 years Methods: Participants will receive&#xD;
      series of ocular exams, including: cycloplegic refractions, strabismus exams, exams of&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, slit lamp exam, fundus exam, axial length measurement, etc. After the&#xD;
      parent's and the participant's agreement, we will have a blood test of 3 ml and undergo DNA&#xD;
      collection (Oragene-DNA; DNA-Genotek, Ottawa, Canada) by study personnel. We will analyze&#xD;
      around 10 SNPs from each of candidate genes in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to patients' previous records and images, subjects will be classified as cases and&#xD;
      controls. &quot;Cases&quot; will be infants with severe treatment-requiring ROP (defined as type-1 ROP&#xD;
      [zone I, any stage, with plus disease; zone I, stage 3, without plus disease; or zone II,&#xD;
      stage 2 or 3, with plus disease] or worse). &quot;Controls&quot; will be full-term babies without other&#xD;
      retinal disorder, infants with no ROP or with mild ROP less severe than type-1 ROP, who are&#xD;
      within the same birth weight group (e.g., &lt;1000 grams or ≥1000 grams). After matching genetic&#xD;
      results and structural outcomes, we will analyze whether any specific genetic polymorphism&#xD;
      had higher presentations in treatment-requiring ROP patients. Also, secondary analysis will&#xD;
      focus on the difference between recurrent/poor outcome cases and other cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Continuous variables will be analyzed with independent-t or paired-t&#xD;
      test. One-way ANOVA will be used to compare three or more groups. Ordinal variables will be&#xD;
      analyzed with Wilcoxon rank sum test (two independent samples) or Wilcoxon signed rank test&#xD;
      (tow paired samples). Categorical variables will be analyzed with Chi-square test or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test. A multivariable logistic regression model will be constructed to assess the&#xD;
      association between myopia prevalence and all studied risk factors. P value &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;

      Our approach for SNP selection from candidate genes includes maximum utilization of data&#xD;
      available from databases (dbSNP, HapMap) and from our own screening for informative genetic&#xD;
      markers. In general, SNP variants for genotyping will be selected from available databases,&#xD;
      such as dbSNP. In cases where a candidate gene has not been screened comprehensively and/or&#xD;
      where data on allele frequencies is not readily available (estimated in 20-25 out of 50&#xD;
      genes, such as ANG-1, ALK-1, etc.), SNPs will be detected by direct sequencing of 20-40 study&#xD;
      subjects. This will allow us to identify all alleles with population frequency &gt;5%, including&#xD;
      intronic SNPs, variants from the regulatory regions (mainly promoters), and cSNPs included in&#xD;
      open reading frames. Data obtained by direct screening also validates the information&#xD;
      extracted from databases, which still contain incomplete information in up to 25% of cases.&#xD;
