  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICIs combined with AATDs have gradually become the mainstream treatment modality for advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, and more related clinical trials are underway. This is undoubtedly&#xD;
      a breakthrough and the main direction for improving the overall 5-year survival rate of the&#xD;
      liver cancer population in the next decade, and a touchstone for exploring the development&#xD;
      and value of liver surgery in the era of comprehensive treatment for advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, there are relatively few reports on various types of translational therapy for&#xD;
      advanced HCC, probably for the following two reasons: (1) advanced hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      is complex, rapidly progressing, difficult to treat, and has low translational efficiency;&#xD;
      (2) the existing translational therapy strategies are highly selective in terms of applicable&#xD;
      population, complex treatment process, and institutional dependence, and cannot achieve&#xD;
      efficient and successful translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there are few studies reported on the application of TACE+ICIs+AATDs to carry out&#xD;
      translational therapy. In the absence of relevant guidelines for reference, advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma may be the best entrance to carry out translational therapy with&#xD;
      ICIs combined with AATDs, and after satisfactory results are achieved in the treatment of&#xD;
      this group of patients, a point-to-point effect can be generated, facilitating the&#xD;
      transformation of TACE+ICIs+AATDs The target population of TACE+ICIs+AATDs translational&#xD;
      therapy can be further expanded. To promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      treatment and improve the long-term survival rate of the overall hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      population. In this study, we enrolled patients with advanced HCC and used TACE+ICIs+AATDs&#xD;
      for conversion therapy to improve the conversion rate, so that unresectable HCC patients&#xD;
      could be converted to a chronic disease state and achieve long-term survival on the one hand,&#xD;
      and provide potential for sequential surgical treatment on the other. The drug of choice is&#xD;
      lenvatinib. This study provides a basis for the clinical application of translational therapy&#xD;
      for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

    <description>TACE therapy: For transarterial infusion chemotherapy before or after TACE embolization, each drug will generally be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% dextrose solution 150-250 mL and injected slowly into the target artery for ≥20 min. Subsequent TACE therapy will be administered on an as-needed basis as assessed by the clinician, with each treatment interval exceeding 6 weeks and no more than 6 treatments in total.&#xD;
Lenvatinib: The starting dose of lenvatinib will depend on the patient's baseline weight: if baseline weight ≥ 60 kg, patients will receive 12 mg of lenvatinib administered once daily; if baseline weight &lt; 60 kg, patients will receive 8 mg of lenvatinib once daily. TACE therapy will be given 3 days apart.&#xD;
Tirelizumab: Tirelizumab 200 mg , intravenous infusion on the same day as the first dose of lenvatinib, once every three weeks.&#xD;
