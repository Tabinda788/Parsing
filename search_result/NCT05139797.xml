      Despite rapidly advancing developments in targeted therapeutics and genetic sequencing,&#xD;
      persistent limits in the accuracy and throughput of clinical phenotyping has led to a&#xD;
      widening gap between the potential and the actual benefits realized by precision medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in machine learning and image processing techniques have shown that machine&#xD;
      learning models can identify features unrecognized by human experts and more&#xD;
      precisely/accurately assess common measurements made in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed an algorithm, termed EchoNet-LVH, to identify cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy and identify patients who would benefit from additional screening for cardiac&#xD;
      amyloidosis and will prospectively evaluate its accuracy in identifying patients whom would&#xD;
      benefit from additional screening for cardiac amyloidosis.&#xD;

      Despite rapidly advancing developments in targeted therapeutics and genetic sequencing,&#xD;
      persistent limits in the accuracy and throughput of clinical phenotyping has led to a&#xD;
      widening gap between the potential and the actual benefits realized by precision medicine.&#xD;
      This conundrum is exemplified by current approaches to assessing morphologic alterations of&#xD;
      the heart. If reliably identified, certain cardiac diseases (e.g. cardiac amyloidosis and&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) could avoid misdiagnosis and receive efficient treatment&#xD;
      initiation with specific targeted therapies. The ability to reliably distinguish between&#xD;
      cardiac disease types of similar morphology but different etiology would also enhance&#xD;
      specificity for linking genetic risk variants and determining mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in machine learning and image processing techniques have shown that machine&#xD;
      learning models can identify features unrecognized by human experts and more&#xD;
      precisely/accurately assess common measurements made in clinical practice. In&#xD;
      echocardiography, this ability for precision measurement and detection is important in both&#xD;
      disease screening as well as diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography is routinely and frequently used for diagnosis and prognostication in&#xD;
      routine clinical care, however there is often subjectivity in interpretation and&#xD;
      heterogeneity in application. Human attention is fatigable and has heterogenous&#xD;
      interpretation between providers. AI guided disease screening workflows have been proposed&#xD;
      for rare diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis and other diseases with relatively low&#xD;
      prevalence but significant human impact with targeted therapies when detected early. This is&#xD;
      an area particularly suitable for AI as there are multiple mimics where diseases like&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, aortic stenosis, and other phenotypes might&#xD;
      visually be similar but can be distinguished by AI algorithms. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed an algorithm, termed EchoNet-LVH, to identify cardiac hypertrophy and identify&#xD;
      patients who would benefit from additional screening for cardiac amyloidosis, hypertrophic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and other diseases. E&#xD;
