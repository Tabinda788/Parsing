  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with haemorrhoids meeting all the eligibility criteria will be allocated in&#xD;
      three study arms: test, placebo and benchmark. Approximately twenty-two subjects per group&#xD;
      will be enrolled to assure that approximately 20 subjects in each group complete the study.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Armenia.The study will last approximately 2 weeks for each&#xD;
      subject and will consist of 3 visits. The first subject first visit is planned for June 2021,&#xD;
      and the study will continue until the target sample size is reached.&#xD;
