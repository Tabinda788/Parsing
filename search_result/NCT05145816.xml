    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability, recommended phase II (RP2) dose, and efficacy&#xD;
      of Belantamab mafodotin for participants with Relapsed Refractory AL Amyloidosis (RRAL.)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyloid light chain amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis, ALA) is a rare plasma cell dyscrasia with an&#xD;
      incidence ranging from 9.7-14.0 cases per million person-years. 75% of patients have cardiac&#xD;
      involvement at diagnosis as evaluated by plasma cardiac biomarkers. The most common cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality is cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Belantamab mafodotin has not been evaluated previously in patients with AL amyloidosis.&#xD;
      Although Belantamab mafodotin has previously been or is currently being evaluated in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), these MM studies do not enroll participants with&#xD;
      clinically significant cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALA represents a new patient population and therapeutic indication where patients invariably&#xD;
      will have clinically significant cardiac, renal or other organ dysfunction at study&#xD;
      enrollment. Therefore, the Phase I/IIa RRAL study will be comprised of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Dose Exploration (Escalation) this will be conducted to identify and select an&#xD;
      appropriate dose of Belantamab mafodotin in regard to safety, as well as a preliminary&#xD;
      evaluation of hematological and organ response. Part 1 will enroll a minimum of 3 to maximum&#xD;
      of 18 patients, per dose cohort, and will be guided using the BOIN design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - Dose Cohort Expansion this will be an expansion cohort to further define the depth&#xD;
      and durability of both hematological and organ response in 19 additional patients for a total&#xD;
      of up to 37 patients.&#xD;

             defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation;&#xD;
             however, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become&#xD;
             heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures&#xD;
             outlined in the protocol, she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Is a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP) and using a contraceptive method&#xD;
                  that is highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year), preferably with&#xD;
                  low user dependency (as described in Appendix 9), during the intervention period&#xD;
                  and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study intervention and agrees&#xD;
                  not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this&#xD;
                  period. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive&#xD;
                  method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test (as required by local&#xD;
                  regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history,&#xD;
                  and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with a&#xD;
                  nearly undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Non-childbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical reasons):&#xD;

&#xD;
             ii. Patients who have been amenorrhoeic for &lt;2 years without history of a hysterectomy&#xD;
             and oophorectomy must have a follicle stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal&#xD;
             range upon screening evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation.&#xD;
             Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the&#xD;
             actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with&#xD;
             medical records of the actual procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during&#xD;
             the intervention period and for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment to&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Refrain from donating sperm&#xD;

                  (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. agree to use a barrier method of birth control (e.g., male condom), even if they&#xD;
                  have undergone a successful vasectomy, and female partner to use an additional&#xD;
                  highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year as when&#xD;
                  having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (including&#xD;
                  pregnant females).&#xD;
