  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common cause of acute pancreatitis is gallstones. It is known that diet and obesity&#xD;
      play a role in the formation of gallstones. It has been reported that the risk of gallstone&#xD;
      formation is two times higher in obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 than in&#xD;
      normal-weight individuals with a BMI between 20-25. The epidemiological literature on the&#xD;
      relationship between diet and risk of acute pancreatitis is very limited. In addition, it is&#xD;
      often unclear which type (acute, recurrent, or chronic) and subtype (gallstone-related or&#xD;
      non-gallstone-related) of acute pancreatitis is studied in studies. Although there are&#xD;
      studies in the literature evaluating the relationship between diet and development of&#xD;
      gallstones or the development of pancreatitis with diet, studies examining the role of diet&#xD;
      in the development of pancreatitis in patients with gallstones are very limited. In this&#xD;
      study, we aimed to investigate the dietary differences in patients with gallstones who had&#xD;
      pancreatitis and those who did not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of acute pancreatitis has been reported as 4.9-35/100.000, and the incidence&#xD;
      increases every year with the increase in obesity and gallstone rates. It is most commonly&#xD;
      observed between the ages of 30-60 and no difference was found in terms of gender&#xD;
      distribution. The most common cause of acute pancreatitis is gallstones. Alcohol use, drugs&#xD;
      and other reasons come next.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that diet and obesity play a role in the formation of gallstones. It has been&#xD;
      reported that the risk of gallstone formation is two times higher in obese individuals with a&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 than in normal-weight individuals with a BMI between 20-25. In&#xD;
      addition, many studies have reported that increased use of dietary refined carbohydrates and&#xD;
      triglycerides and reduced dietary fiber intake are associated with gallstone formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemiological literature on the relationship between diet and risk of acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis is very limited. In addition, it is often unclear which type (acute, recurrent,&#xD;
      or chronic) and subtype (gallstone-related or non-gallstone-related) of acute pancreatitis is&#xD;
      studied in studies. On the other hand, Sarles et al. In a comprehensive study conducted in&#xD;
      1973, he reported that high fat and protein consumption and alcoholism increase the risk of&#xD;
      pancreatitis, regardless of etiology. Few case-control and ecological studies have evaluated&#xD;
      the effect of protein, fat, and carbohydrate intakes on alcohol-related or gallstone-related&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis risk or non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis risk or acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the twentieth century, an inverse relationship between coffee consumption&#xD;
      and the risk of alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis was observed in a prospective study, and&#xD;
      an inverse relationship with fruit consumption in two smaller case-control studies, and a&#xD;
      positive association with consumption of freshwater fish and parboiled rice. In parallel,&#xD;
      overly large meals and food allergies after a long period of fasting have been reported to be&#xD;
      risk factors for acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are studies in the literature evaluating the relationship between diet and&#xD;
      development of gallstones or the development of pancreatitis with diet, studies examining the&#xD;
      role of diet in the development of pancreatitis in patients with gallstones are very limited.&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to investigate the dietary differences in patients with gallstones&#xD;
      who had pancreatitis and those who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, age, gender, body mass index, alcohol and cigarette consumption status, daily&#xD;
      physical activity status, eating frequency, frequency of food consumption for three days, and&#xD;
      their food consumption status will be evaluated with the BeBis 8 Full version program and it&#xD;
      will be compared whether there is a difference between patients who had pancreatitis and&#xD;
      those who did not. .&#xD;
