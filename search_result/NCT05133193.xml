  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of a 14-day concomitant therapy for the&#xD;
      third-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, and whether it is safe while&#xD;
      maintaining an ideal eradication rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infects half of the world's population. H.pylori eradication is an&#xD;
      effective approach to reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer. However, eradication&#xD;
      rates of first-line therapy decreased over years due to the rapidly increasing antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance of H. pylori worldwide. An ideal rescue therapeutic regimen to cure refractory&#xD;
      H.pylori infection is currently warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few published paper evaluated the efficacy of 14-day furazolidone containing concomitant&#xD;
      therapy in the third line treatment. This study aims to propose a new concomitant therapy for&#xD;
      the patients with three or more treatment failure, and then evaluates whether adverse effects&#xD;
      are tolerable. .&#xD;
