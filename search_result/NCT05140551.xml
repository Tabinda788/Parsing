  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to understand the feasibility and acceptability of implementing&#xD;
      COMPASS: Online Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in routine NHS care for individuals with&#xD;
      diabetes. People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes with co-morbid psychological distress will be&#xD;
      invited to take part in a pre-post implementation study of COMPASS: Online CBT for managing&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in context of Long-Term conditions (LTCs). Patients with diabetes who&#xD;
      are also experiencing depression and/or anxiety and/or diabetes specific distress will be&#xD;
      recruited from: Improving Access to Psychological therapies (IAPT) services or clinics within&#xD;
      Guys and St Thomas National Health Service (NHS) trust (GSTT) in London, United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;

    <description>COMPASS is an evidence based digital CBT intervention with guided therapist support, tailored to treat anxiety and/or depression in long term conditions (LTCs). The intervention consists of eleven modules/sessions in which CBT techniques are taught. Users of COMPASS receive guided therapist support from a trained therapist. The guided support aims to help patients identify and apply the CBT skills outlined in COMPASS to meet their individual needs and experiences of living with LTC(s). The support can occur through in-site messaging or via the telephone.</description>
