  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to collect the clinical activity and management data of the Orthogeriatrics&#xD;
      and Orthopedics Units participating in the study on a continuous and long-term basis. By&#xD;
      collecting clinical data and comparing the performance of the various centers, the study aims&#xD;
      to guide the participating centers towards the principles of good clinical practice in&#xD;
      orthogeriatrics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multicenter prospective cohort observational study. The enrollment period will be 5 years. An&#xD;
      additional 4 months will be required to allow the last enrolled patients to complete the&#xD;
      120-day follow-up. It is estimated to enroll a total of 7,000 patients. To facilitate the&#xD;
      participation in the study of non-university or IRCCS assistance departments, two methods of&#xD;
      data collection will be possible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High intensity: continuous data collection for the whole period of the study on all the&#xD;
           incident cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low intensity: data collection once a year on incident cases over a continuous period of&#xD;
           1 month, with a reduced number of variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of the level of intensity with regard to the data collection method will take&#xD;
      place on a voluntary basis (each OU will actually choose the type of speed with which it&#xD;
      intends to collaborate in the project, after communicating to the steering committee and to&#xD;
      the biostatisticians of the study)&#xD;

    <description>Progressively direct all the centers participating in the study towards the principles of orthogeriatric &quot;good clinical practice&quot;, periodically analyzing their performances and comparing them with those established as optimal by the international scientific literature; in this perspective, the study can be configured as a &quot;quality improvement project&quot;. In fact, the multidisciplinary discussion and comparison that will follow the systematic review of the indicators analyzed will stimulate, as has already happened elsewhere (e.g. in the United Kingdom), a process of continuous improvement of clinical and surgical practices.</description>
