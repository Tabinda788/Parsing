  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this pilot RCT are to examine if the Talk Test is an effective and safe&#xD;
      tool as compared with CPET for exercise prescription in patients who have undergone CABG or&#xD;
      PCI and enrolled in a home-based CR program with virtual exercise training monitoring.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Talk Test has been shown to be a valid, practical and inexpensive tool for guiding&#xD;
      exercise training in patients with CAD. The general premise of the Talk Test is that&#xD;
      exercising at or above the ventilatory threshold or lactate threshold does not allow&#xD;
      comfortable, conversational speech and thus serves as a means of estimating the cut point&#xD;
      between moderate and vigorous intensity exercise. The Talk Test can be used to produce&#xD;
      exercise intensities (64 to 95% HR peak i.e. moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise) within&#xD;
      accepted Canadian Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (CACPR)&#xD;
      guidelines for exercise training, to avoid exertional ischemia, and has been shown to be&#xD;
      consistent across various modes of exercise (i.e. walking, jogging, cycling, elliptical&#xD;
      trainer and stair stepper).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a critical need to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using the Talk Test as&#xD;
      the principal method of exercise prescription in patients with CAD who have undergone CABG or&#xD;
      PCI when compared to standard care CPET. Such a trial has wide-scale appeal for CR programs&#xD;
      across Canada and beyond. It will directly and positively impact patient care by reducing the&#xD;
      need for in-person interactions for CPET, of paramount importance during COVID-19 outbreaks,&#xD;
      between patients and CR staff, thus reducing COVID-19 infection risk and concerns of&#xD;
      contracting the virus.&#xD;

These responses will be coded as &quot;does not comply&quot;, &quot;complies&quot; and &quot;exceeds&quot;. CPET group: HR will be measured during exercise training using the Polar A370 device. Where participants exercise below, within or above the prescribed HR ranges (64 to 95% HR peak), they will be coded as &quot;does not comply&quot;, &quot;complies&quot; and &quot;exceeds&quot;. All participants will wear Polar A370 devices during their exercise training sessions. Exercise HRs will be compared between the Talk Test and CPET groups.</description>
