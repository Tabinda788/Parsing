  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is one of the components of severe mental disorders. It has the characteristics&#xD;
      of prolonged course, low cure rate, high recurrence rate and high disability rate. It brings&#xD;
      many short-term and long-term effects to individuals, families and society. Studies on&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia mainly focus on cross-sectional and case-control studies, but&#xD;
      there is a lack of long-term follow-up of patients with schizophrenia in the community.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study would establish a cohort study to solve the chronological relationship&#xD;
      between exposure and effect, focus on community schizophrenia, and establish a community&#xD;
      schizophrenia patient biobank that has been tracked for a long time from diagnosis.&#xD;

      Schizophrenia is one of the components of severe mental disorders. It has the characteristics&#xD;
      of prolonged course, low cure rate, high recurrence rate and high disability rate. It brings&#xD;
      many short-term and long-term effects to individuals, families and society.Studies on&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia mainly focus on cross-sectional and case-control studies, but&#xD;
      there is a lack of long-term follow-up of patients with schizophrenia in the community.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study would establish a cohort study to solve the chronological relationship&#xD;
      between exposure and effect, focus on community schizophrenia, and establish a community&#xD;
      schizophrenia patient biobank that has been tracked for a long time from diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Based on previous studies, this study will focus on patients with schizophrenia in&#xD;
           the community. Establishing a biobank of new cases to monitor the occurrence of disease&#xD;
           recurrences, violent behaviours and other outcome events during the whole life cycle of&#xD;
           schizophrenia patients. Exploring the predictive effects of biological, psychosocial,&#xD;
           imaging and other indicators on patient recurrence and other events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 At the same time, establishing a sample database of patients with schizophrenia in&#xD;
           the community to lay a working foundation and reserve sample resources for subsequent&#xD;
           related mechanism research, drug research, and intervention research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Content of the study 2.1 At least 1,200 patients with schizophrenia diagnosed within&#xD;
           three years will be recruited. On the basis of community follow-up and health&#xD;
           examination, this study will expand biological sample collection and professional scale&#xD;
           evaluation, establish a schizophrenia community cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Based on the establishment of the cohort, this study will carry out statistical&#xD;
           description according to the type of data. The differences will be compared between the&#xD;
           exposed group and the unexposed group in demographic information, family and past&#xD;
           disease history, personal living habits, condition and treatment, psychological&#xD;
           evaluation, social support evaluation, sleep quality, functional evaluation, quality of&#xD;
           life and other content. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to compare&#xD;
           the differences in blood pressure, blood glucose and other indicators between the&#xD;
           exposed group and the unexposed group. The generalized estimating equation will be used&#xD;
           to analyze the relationship between the outcome of recurrence and emergency about&#xD;
           physical activity, related biochemical indicators, and social support. On the basis of&#xD;
           statistical results, this study will carry out research on the prognostic factors and&#xD;
           related physiological mechanisms of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design 3.1 Pay attention to multiple prognostic outcomes such as relapse,&#xD;
           dangerous behaviours, suicide and self-harm, calculate the included sample size based on&#xD;
           this. After the start of the project, in Hongkou, Jinshan, Minhang, and Xuhui districts,&#xD;
           all schizophrenic patients in management who meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           continuously included in the district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 At baseline, the patient's demographic information and a complete health history (include&#xD;
      personal history, family history, and medical history) will be taken. The questionnaire&#xD;
      survey includes the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)，the Patient Health Questionnaire-9&#xD;
      (PHQ-9)，the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&#xD;
      (PSQI) , the WHO Quality of Life Scale-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) , the Modified Overt Aggression&#xD;
      Scale (MOAS), the 10-item social disability screening schedule (SDSS) and the Perceived&#xD;
      social support scale(PSSS),etc. Within six months of the completion of the baseline survey,&#xD;
      the district-level mental health center arranges for patients in the district to participate&#xD;
      in physical examinations. All measures will be administered at baseline and 12, 24 and 36&#xD;
      months follow-up except for the health history and PSSS, which will be administered only at&#xD;
      baseline. Besides, the study will focus on the patients' recurrence events, violent behavior,&#xD;
      various impacts on society and family, emergency response events, and prognosis by carrying&#xD;
      out active follow-up every three months.&#xD;

    <measure>1-year BPRS reduction rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline BPRS at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was used to measure the presence and severity of psychiatric symptoms entailing positive symptoms, general psychopathology, and affective symptoms (e.g., thought disturbance, emotional withdrawal, hostility, and suspiciousness) for patients with mental illness, particularly schizophrenia. Each of the 18 items are designed to represent a discrete symptom area. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale, from 1 = &quot;not present&quot; to 7 = &quot;extremely severe&quot;, with scores ranging from 18 to 126 (achieved through summing the item scores). Higher scores indicated more severity of psychiatric symptoms.&#xD;
Reduction rate was calculated using the following formula: reduction rate= (Score before treatment - Score after treatment)/(Score before treatment - 18) × 100%. A reduction rate of BPRS score &gt; 25% was considered as a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <description>The Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) is a four-part behavior rating scale used to evaluate and document the &quot;frequency and severity&quot; of aggressive episodes. The rating scale is made up of four categories; verbal aggression, aggression against objects, aggression against self, and aggression against others. Each category consists of five responses, which over time can track the patient's aggressive behavior. The MOAS is one of the most widely used measures for violence and aggression, with 4 items in total, 0~4 points for each item.</description>

    <measure>1-year PSQI</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline PSQI at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The questionnaire consists of a combination of Likert- type and open-ended questions. Respondents are asked to indicate how frequently they have experienced certain sleep difficulties over the past month and to rate their overall sleep quality. Scores for each question range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more acute sleep disturbances.</description>
