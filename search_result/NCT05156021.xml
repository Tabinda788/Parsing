  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), subsequent&#xD;
      neovascular glaucoma (NVG) has become one of the main causes of blindness in PDR patients,&#xD;
      and the intraocular pressure of PDR patients with NVG is often stubborn. For these patients,&#xD;
      not only is the effect of drugs in lowering intraocular pressure poor, but the results of&#xD;
      surgery are often unsatisfactory. Because of its poor prognosis, clinical research for better&#xD;
      strategy is of great significance in the current situation. At present, for such patients, a&#xD;
      combination of effective control of intraocular pressure and treatment of the primary disease&#xD;
      is often used. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical effects of&#xD;
      preoperative or intraoperative anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drug therapy&#xD;
      combined with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP), and&#xD;
      pressure-reducing valve implantation in patients with NVG secondary to PDR. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      changes of neurotrophic factors in the vitreous humor before and after anti-VEGF treatment&#xD;
      will be explored.&#xD;
