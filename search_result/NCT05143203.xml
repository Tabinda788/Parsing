    <textblock>
      Its a prospective, non-interventional, single-center study, involving the human person&#xD;
      evaluating the impact of self-hypnosis training on anxiety level and burn out in nursing and&#xD;
      medical staff&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Like other pandemics, that of Covid-19 had a significant psychological impact on the general&#xD;
      population. However, this impact turned out to be even more acute among healthcare workers,&#xD;
      in connection with repeated exposure to the risk of infection, the reorganization of care and&#xD;
      their specific positioning (...) Psychotraumatic, anxiety and depression symptoms has been&#xD;
      observed worldwide. The staff of CHR Metz-Thionville were not spared. From the first wave,&#xD;
      the caregivers exposed directly to SARS-CoV-2 (emergency, resuscitation, cohorting sector)&#xD;
      requested the hypnosis referent doctor of the structure, in order to benefit from hypnosis&#xD;
      sessions in order to better manage their anxiety during the sanitary crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main demand from caregivers was learning stress management tools and a desire for&#xD;
      empowerment without psychological support. For information, the support platform set up by&#xD;
      the psychiatry service recorded very few calls (39 caregivers from March 24, 2020 to June 26,&#xD;
      2020). Faced with the influx of hypnotherapy requests, the training unit was asked to set up&#xD;
      on-site self-hypnosis training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seemed important to measure the effect of this learning on the mental health of caregivers&#xD;
      using psychometric scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This training was initially offered to front-line caregivers in the fight against the&#xD;
      covid-19 pandemic and by extension to all caregivers wishing to be trained in this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is obvious that this pandemic may have worsened a general ill-being of caregivers already&#xD;
      present before the current health crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many studies on the management of anxiety and pain in patients with a history of&#xD;
      chronic disease, and some have focused specifically on learning self-hypnosis techniques.&#xD;
      Even if the protocols for learning self-hypnosis techniques are very heterogeneous in these&#xD;
      various pathologies, there is a common observation : &quot;studies show positive results on&#xD;
      self-esteem, catastrophism, depression, quality of sleep , the somatizations, the anxiety of&#xD;
      the patients (and of their parents for the children), mood &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, and to our knowledge, there are no methodologically rigorous studies measuring the&#xD;
      effects of hypnosis or self-hypnosis on the mental health of caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications are often limited to clinical cases or positions related to the use of hypnosis&#xD;
      and / or self-hypnosis for the well-being of caregivers.&#xD;

    <measure>Professional Quality of Life evaluation D-7</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days before the start of the training of the first group</time_frame>
    <description>The Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) is a 30 item self-report questionnaire designed to measure compassion fatigue, work satisfaction and burnout in helping professionals. Helping professionals are defined broadly, from those in health care settings, such as psychologists, nurses and doctors. It is useful for workers who perform emotional labour as well as professionals who are exposed to traumatic situations. Raw scores between 10 and 50 are presented for the three subscales (1) Compassion Satisfaction, (2) Burnout and (3) Secondary Traumatic Stress. Each score is also presented as a percentile rank comparing the respondent's scores to scores of helping professionals generally (such as psychologists, doctors, teachers and first responders). A percentile of 50 represents an average score. High scores on Compassion Satisfaction and low scores on Burnout and Secondary Traumatic Stress are indicative of professional health.</description>
