  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) is associated with a pathological humoral&#xD;
      immune response against the aquaporin-4(AQP-4) water channel. Belimumab (Benlysta ®) is a&#xD;
      human immunoglobulin G1λ monoclonal antibody that inhibits B-cell survival and&#xD;
      differentiation by neutralizing soluble B lymphocyte stimulator. Belimumab may benefit some&#xD;
      patients with NMOSD due to the important role of B cells in the pathogenesis of NMOSD.&#xD;
      Clincial trials may be needed to observe its efficacy and safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators primarily aim to observe the time to first relapse from initiation of&#xD;
      belimumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are to determine: The safety profile of belimumab in participants with&#xD;
      NMO and whether belimumab improves Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), et al.&#xD;
