  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project concerns a population at risk of sudden death by dissection of the thoracic&#xD;
      aorta. Its interest is to make it possible to recognize the genes that protect or worsen the&#xD;
      evolution of aneurysms, to better understand the mechanisms involved, to detect and treat&#xD;
      aneurysms of the thoracic aorta, wich is a pathology that is completely silent clinically&#xD;
      until life-threatening complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variability in the severity of the disease within the same family is related to modifier&#xD;
      genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to find the modifying factors that account for the variability in the&#xD;
      severity of the progression of aneurysms of the thoracic aorta.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic aortic aneurysms are silent, asymptomatic, potentially fatal pathologies due to the&#xD;
      risk of aortic dissection. More and more often they are found during imaging tests done for&#xD;
      another reason. Some aneurysms have genetic origin (autosomal dominantly inherited) and are&#xD;
      particularly interesting because they can be recognized early (due to possible family&#xD;
      screening), which allows us to understand the natural history of this pathology. The&#xD;
      discovery of genes whose mutations explain the occurrence of these family aneurysms&#xD;
      (initiator gene) has also made it possible to improve family screening and to better&#xD;
      understand the pathophysiology of these aneurysms: we now recognize 3 groups of genes&#xD;
      involved (extracellular matrix, contractile proteins of smooth muscle cell, TGF-β pathway&#xD;
      (Transforming Growth Factor) [including mutations in TGF-β receptor 2 gene, TGFBR2]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variability in the severity of signs and aortic involvement is particularly marked in&#xD;
      patients with aortic aneurysms due to mutations in the TGFBR2 gene. Some patients with these&#xD;
      mutations present aggressive aneurysms with early dissection. Other patients have isolated&#xD;
      late-onset aneurysms, and others have no signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This variability generates problems for clinical practice to give appropriate genetic advice,&#xD;
      but also to adapt imaging monitoring, therapy, or sports restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol aims is to investigate the variability in the severity of the disease&#xD;
      within a large family carrying a mutation in the TGFBR2 gene. The MFS1 family is a family in&#xD;
      which the aortic pathology is due to a mutation in the TGFBR2 gene. All patients with this&#xD;
      family carry the same TGFBR2 mutation, heterozygous.&#xD;
