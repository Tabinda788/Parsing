  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome in an cardiology service of tertiary training and research hospital. The clinical&#xD;
      pharmacist, within the scope of the discharge education services, provided medication&#xD;
      reconciliation, medication review, individually prepared patient medicine (pill) card,&#xD;
      patient education (based on Health Belief Model by using written material and video, and&#xD;
      verbally [by using Teach back method especially for patients with low health literacy]) and&#xD;
      counseling (using behavior change techniques based on The Capability, Opportunity, and&#xD;
      Motivation Behavior [COM-B] model). The control group received standard care.&#xD;

    <description>Adherence to Cardioprotective Medications (Clopidogrel, Statins, Beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors/ARB) through 1 year assessed by Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS).

    <measure>Quality of Life Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life from baseline assessed with EuroQol questionnaire EQ-5D-3L through 1 year. (EQ-5D-3L) is a standardized scale for use as a measure of the quality of life. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions (5D): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels (3L): no problems (1 point), some problems (2 points), extreme problems (3 points).&#xD;
This gives a total of 245 different health states, adding unconscious and dead.</description>

    <description>Change in beliefs about medicines from baseline assessed with Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) through 1 year. The BMQ-Specific Scale comprises two 5-item factors evaluating beliefs about the necessity of prescribed medication (Specific-Necessity) and concerns about prescribed medication based on beliefs about the danger of dependence, long-term toxicity, and the disruptive effects of medication (Specific-Concerns). Individual items are scored on a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The total score ranges from 10 (lowest score) to 50 (highest score). Higher scores indicate stronger beliefs.</description>

Brief illness perception questionnaire is a nine-item scale designed to rapidly assess the cognitive and emotional representations of illness. Total scale range 0 to 10. A higher score indicates a more threatening view of the illness.</description>
