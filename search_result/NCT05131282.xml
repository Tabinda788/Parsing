  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate a blood test that can identify women at high-risk of PE at&#xD;
      the 1st or early 2nd trimester.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PE incidence is 5-8% of all pregnancies in US and worldwide. Morbidity, mortality, and&#xD;
      medical legal risks of missing PE often lead to over diagnosis. Currently there is no&#xD;
      molecular blood laboratory developed test which can allow serial micro-samplings to assess&#xD;
      the PE risk when asymptomatic at home setting along the duration of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a blood test can predict PE with a sensitivity higher than 85% and a&#xD;
      specificity higher than 80% at early gestation in a PE-Normal cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-site retrospective cohort of women who developed PE and women with normal pregnancy&#xD;
      will be recruited. Blood samples have been collected from each subject once at the 1st&#xD;
      trimester or early 2nd trimester. Delivery and neonatal data have been collected through&#xD;
      chart reviews. Two groups (PE and Normal) are matched with age and clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an observational study of the accuracy of a diagnostic test on PE prediction. There is&#xD;
      only one group of participants. Participants will be tested using a blood test to determine&#xD;
      positive or negative. Sensitivity and specificity (Primary outcomes) of the test will be&#xD;
      measured at the end of study.&#xD;

        A single-site prospective cohort of women who had developed PE (i.e. the PE group) and&#xD;
        women who had normal pregnancy (i.e. the Normal group) will be recruited. Maternal serum&#xD;
        samples were collected from each woman at 8-21 weeks of GA. The two-group women are matched&#xD;
        by age, BMI, pregnant history, and other clinical information. The PE-to-Normal ratio is&#xD;
        around 1:2.&#xD;
