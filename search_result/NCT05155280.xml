  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serotoninergic activity in brain structures involved in food control and avoidance, such as&#xD;
      the basal ganglia, is poorly understood in Anorexia Nervosa.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)- functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) approach and testing of food preferences and choices will provide further insight into&#xD;
      the link between potential abnormalities in serotoninergic transmission and the specific food&#xD;
      restriction disorder for Anorexia Nervosa. These Data can pave the way for new therapeutic&#xD;
      avenues.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>PET imaging using [11C]DASB radioligand.</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete a food choice task in PET/MRI. During the task, PET and MRI scans will be acquired simultaneously. This will allow us to see in real time during food choices the brain activations of the subjects. For imaging we will inject the DASB tracer intravenously. This radio ligand is a tracer that allows us to see the cerebral serotoninergic transmission by positron emission tomography.</description>

    <description>The second technique used is the eye tracker that will allow us to analyze food avoidance behaviors through the eyes. With a &quot;TOBII&quot; eye tracker we wil be able to follow the gaze of the subjects during the food preference task. It is a non-invasive approach.</description>
