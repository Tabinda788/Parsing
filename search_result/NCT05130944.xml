  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current protocol is to describe a cluster randomized feasibility trial&#xD;
      examining the integration of a scalable stress management intervention into Entre Nosotras&#xD;
      ('among/between us'), a community-based psychosocial intervention for migrant and host&#xD;
      community women in Ecuador and Panamá.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically the study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the relevance, acceptability, and feasibility of integrating a stress management&#xD;
           intervention into community-based participatory women's group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the feasibility of conducting a fully-powered cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
           trial evaluating the effectiveness and implementation of integrating a stress management&#xD;
           intervention into a community-based participatory women's group as compared to&#xD;
           community-based participatory women's groups alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research directly targets two public health areas with major gaps in evidence in&#xD;
      the field of humanitarian settings: (1) protection and safety, and (2) mental health and&#xD;
      psychosocial wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be conducted in three sites in Ecuador and Panama. Latin America has&#xD;
      recently experienced increasing levels of forced migration due to political conflict,&#xD;
      community violence, and other factors. Panamá and Ecuador host refugees, asylum seekers, and&#xD;
      migrants from a range of Central and South American countries (e.g., Colombia, Nicaragua,&#xD;
      Venezuela). Migrants in these contexts face mental health and psychosocial problems, threats&#xD;
      to their safety, and disrupted social support systems. Gaps in psychosocial services to&#xD;
      address these problems despite their high prevalence persist in both countries and have been&#xD;
      exacerbated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
