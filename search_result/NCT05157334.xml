  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional study aims to investigate the effect of deep breathing (DB) and&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) on heart rate variability (HRV) in&#xD;
      healthy participants and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE). HRV is used as a surrogate measure of vagal nerve tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three sub-projects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-project 1: To compare the effect of one session of DB and one session of non-invasive&#xD;
      auricular tVNS on vagal nerve tone measured by HRV in healthy participants and in patients&#xD;
      with RA and SLE. The hypotheses is that DB has a similar effect on HRV as non-invasive&#xD;
      electrical tVNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-project 2: A dose-response study in healthy participants comparing the effect of 5, 15&#xD;
      and 30 minutes of DB on HRV. The hypothesis was that HRV increases as a function of the&#xD;
      number of minutes the DB is performed in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-project 3: To investigate the effect of the optimal dose found in sub-project 2 in&#xD;
      patients with RA and SLE measured by HRV, and to investigate its reproducibility by doing it&#xD;
      twice.The hypothesis was that HRV increases after DB in patients with RA and SLE, and the&#xD;
      effect is reproducible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all three sub-projects the washout period will be investigated by measuring HRV three&#xD;
      times after the intervention. We hypothesise that the effect of DB and tVNS on HRV decreases&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Non-invasive auricular electrical transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>A NEMOS Â® stimulator (Cerbomed, Erlangen, Germany) is used for transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation. This is a handheld battery driven stimulator which stimulates conca in the outer ear. It stimulates in a serie of small electrical impulses with a pulse width at 250 us and a frequency at 25 Hz for 30 minutes in a cycle for 30 seconds &quot;on&quot; and 30 seconds &quot;off&quot; to avoid habituation. It is previously indicated that a stimulation intensity at 0,5 mA, 1 mA or 1,5 mA does not cause a significant chance in HRV, thus 0,5 mA is used in this study.</description>
