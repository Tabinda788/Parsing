  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is a common pathology within children and shows a wide&#xD;
      spectrum of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). These symptoms have a significant impact on&#xD;
      a child's well-being. For the treatment of LUTS in children urotherapy, a non-medicamentous&#xD;
      form of therapy, is implemented as standard therapy. It can be described as a bladder&#xD;
      re-education and rehabilitation programme where the participants are informed on the anatomy&#xD;
      and physiology of the normal and pathological urinary system. Urotherapy has been offered as&#xD;
      individual therapy for a long time but is now also offered as group therapy (the voiding&#xD;
      school). This is, as compared to the individual therapy, more cost-effective and gives the&#xD;
      participants the feeling not to be alone in the situation. The effectiveness of the&#xD;
      individual therapy for children with LUTD has already been determined, however little&#xD;
      research has been done on the effectiveness of urotherapy in group (the voiding class). The&#xD;
      present study wants to investigate the effect of the group therapy on the symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life of children with LUTD.&#xD;

      The current study is a prospective cohort-study in which information of the impact of the&#xD;
      voiding class on the symptoms and well-being of the children is obtained through two&#xD;
      questionnaires, respectively the Vancouver Symptom Score for Dysfunctional Elimination&#xD;
      Syndrome (VSSDES) and the Paediatric Incontinence Questionnaire (PinQ). Participants of this&#xD;
      study are as well asked to complete drinking and voiding charts and nocturnal diaries. These&#xD;
      questionnaires and documents are filled in before and after the voiding class. The collected&#xD;
      data will be further analysed statistically trough Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPPS), to determine significant improvements in symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;
