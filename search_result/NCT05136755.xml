      Most of the current antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) are based upon the&#xD;
      monoamine hypothesis which cannot fully explain the etiology of depression. NMDA hypofunction&#xD;
      has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. This study aims to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of an NMDA enhancer (NMDAE) in the treatment of antidepressant&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multi-factorial disorder. Most of the current&#xD;
      antidepressants are based upon the monoamine hypothesis which cannot fully explain the&#xD;
      etiology of depression. Many patients respond poorly to antidepressants and suffer from side&#xD;
      effects. NMDA hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. MDD is&#xD;
      often associated with cognitive deficits which are not necessarily recovered by current&#xD;
      antidepressants. The NMDA receptor regulates synaptic plasticity, memory, and cognition.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to examine the efficacy and safety as well as cognitive function&#xD;
      improvement of NMDAE in the treatment of antidepressant nonresponders with MDD. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll a total of 50 antidepressant nonresponders with MDD. All patients,&#xD;
      continuing their originally ongoing treatment throughout the study period, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into either of two treatment groups: NMDAE or placebo. We will biweekly measure&#xD;
      clinical performances using 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Global Assessment&#xD;
      of Function, Perceived Stress Scale, Visual Analogue Scale for pain, Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression, and side effects. Quality of life and cognitive functions will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and at endpoint of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacies of NMDAE and placebo will be compared. Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test)&#xD;
      will be used to compare differences of categorical variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
      if the distribution is not normal) for continuous variables between treatment groups. Mean&#xD;
      changes from baseline in repeated-measure assessments will be assessed using the generalized&#xD;
      estimating equation (GEE). All p values for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed&#xD;
      tests with a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
