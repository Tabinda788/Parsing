  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During critical PPE shortages, such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC&#xD;
      recommends N95 extended use (wearing the same N95 for multiple patient encounters) and&#xD;
      limited reuse (storing an N95 between shifts for use over multiple shifts with or without&#xD;
      decontamination) as contingency and crisis capacity strategies, respectively. Many healthcare&#xD;
      workers are employing these strategies out of necessity. The sustained performance of these&#xD;
      respirators depends on the respirator maintaining its filtration efficiency and its ability&#xD;
      to provide an adequate seal (fit) to the user's face. Fit testing is performed when a&#xD;
      respirator is issued to the user and on an annual basis thereafter. A user-seal check is then&#xD;
      performed whenever a respirator is donned. Previous studies have found repeated&#xD;
      donnings/doffings to significantly decrease the respirator's fit. A recent pilot&#xD;
      cross-sectional clinical study conducted by the University of California, San Francisco found&#xD;
      fit failures of respirators after being worn for 2 shifts. However, more definitive data&#xD;
      regarding respirator performance during reuse and extended use are lacking. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to address these critical gaps in knowledge by conducting a prospective cohort study to&#xD;
      determine the incidence of N95 fit failure when subjected to extended use/reuse in a clinical&#xD;
      setting. The investigators plan to enroll 396 ED providers (including physicians, nurses, and&#xD;
      staff) when obtaining a new NIOSH approved N95s and performing serial fit tests at the end of&#xD;
      each 8-12 hour shift for up to 5 clinical shifts or until N95 failure, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
      By carefully measuring fit test failure in a clinical setting, the investigators will be able&#xD;
      to provide guidance regarding the safety of N95 extended use and reuse necessitated by the&#xD;
      need for PPE conservation. Specifically, the investigators will address the following&#xD;
      research questions: 1) how long N95s maintain their fit during extended use, 2) how many&#xD;
      times N95s can be donned/doffed and maintain their fit, 3) the ability of a user seal check&#xD;
      to indicate fit in the field, 4) what adverse health effects, reports of discomfort, or&#xD;
      symptoms are experienced by users during extended use and reuse, 5) what effect does extended&#xD;
      use and reuse have on N95 filtration performance, 6) the level of contamination of N95s when&#xD;
      subjected to extended use and reuse, 7) the effect of modifications to N95 (covering an N95&#xD;
      with a face shield or surgical N95s, facial coverings) on fit failure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Frontline healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Personal&#xD;
      protective equipment (PPE), such as an N95 respirator (N95), is essential for prevention of&#xD;
      COVID-19 among HCWs. N95s can prevent aerosolized transmission of viral particles and reduce&#xD;
      COVID-19 among HCWs, helping to reduce infection rates and preserve the workforce. Under&#xD;
      normal circumstances, the CDC recommends that HCWs dispose of N95s after a single patient&#xD;
      encounter. However, during critical PPE shortages such as those during the current COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, the CDC recommends N95 extended use (wearing the same N95 for multiple patient&#xD;
      encounters) and re-use (storing an N95 between shifts for use over multiple shifts). N95&#xD;
      shortages have been widely reported during the COVID-19 pandemic and have forced HCWs to&#xD;
      practice extended use and reuse of N95s. Despite the CDC's guidelines, there are limited data&#xD;
      regarding the efficacy of N95s under conditions of extended use and reuse and existing&#xD;
      studies have been conducted in laboratory settings rather than in the actual health care&#xD;
      environment. (Bergman 2012; Vuma et al 2019). This has left health care workers, including&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, without&#xD;
      clear guidance regarding N95 conservation. Many have implemented various reuse and extended&#xD;
      use policies out of necessity but with no empirical evidence of their safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study team conducted a pilot cross-sectional study of 68 ED providers who wore either a&#xD;
      3M 1860 dome style N95 or a duckbill N951. 70.6% of duckbill N95 failed a standardized fit&#xD;
      test with 3M bitter solution and a hood. Of the dome style , 27.5% failed a fit test. N95&#xD;
      failure was associated with increasing numbers of shifts used: There were 0/11 failures after&#xD;
      1 shift, 1/12 failures after 2 shifts, 3/13 failures after 3 shifts, and 10/15 failures after&#xD;
      4 or more shifts. Also, more donnings and doffings were associated with fit failure, with a&#xD;
      median of 8 donning and doffings in the fit pass group and 15 donning and doffings in the fit&#xD;
      failure group. This preliminary study had a number of limitations, including a small sample&#xD;
      size, convenience sampling, and cross-sectional design, and so was unable to definitively&#xD;
      identify the number of shifts or donnings/doffings for which N95s can be safely reused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a prospective cohort study of 396 participants across 6&#xD;
      ED sites to estimate the cumulative incidence of N95s when subjected to extended use and&#xD;
      reuse in a clinical (emergency department) setting with fit test failure and contamination as&#xD;
      the main endpoints. The investigators also seek to compare the fit test failure between&#xD;
      varying types of HCWs wearing a number of N95 types. Additionally, the investigators will&#xD;
      collect the N95s used in this study for additional analyses of at an outside laboratory&#xD;
      measuring COVID-19 contamination levels and filtration efficiency.&#xD;
