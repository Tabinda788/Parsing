  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A caesarean section (C/S) is a surgical procedure performed to prevent difficulties during&#xD;
      childbirth. World Health Organization considered the standard rate for the C/S would be&#xD;
      between 10% and 15%. However, since 2000 the rate of C/S was increasing globally, and it&#xD;
      became about twofold from 12.1% to 21.1% in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bangladesh, C/S continued to increase from 8% (2007) to 33% (2017). Medically unnecessary&#xD;
      C/S was estimated about 77% of all C/S in 2018, and it was increased from 66% since 2016. In&#xD;
      Bangladesh, unnecessary C/S observed 9.0% and 3.2% C/S done due to avoid labour pain and 5.8%&#xD;
      for the convenience of the mother. The economic burden of each C/S is average USD 612 and&#xD;
      unfortunately, each patient spends this amount of money from out of pocket. Aim of this study&#xD;
      is to do ultrasonography and health education can reduce unnecessary caesarean section among&#xD;
      pregnant women compared to control group in a resource poor setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct this randomized controlled trial (RCT) at Dhaka and Sir Salimullah&#xD;
      Medical College &amp; Hospital, and two rural Upazila Health Complexes (Savar Upazila Health&#xD;
      Complex and Munshigonj General Hospital). Investigators will randomly select one urban&#xD;
      hospital from two urban hospitals and one rural hospital from two rural hospitals for the&#xD;
      intervention. The other one urban and one rural hospital will be assigned as control&#xD;
      hospitals. One research staff, who will not involve any of the research activity of this&#xD;
      trial, will do this randomization. Pregnant mothers will be identified and recruited during&#xD;
      their routine antenatal visits. Pregnant mothers receive 2 USG during their routine ANC&#xD;
      visits at 1st visit of 8-12 weeks and 4th visit of 36-38 weeks. In the intervention centres,&#xD;
      Investigators will perform additional 4 ANC visits at 20, 30, 36 and 40 weeks (total 8&#xD;
      visits) and USG additional 2 times during the 2nd visit of 24-26 weeks and 5th visit of 34&#xD;
      weeks (2 routine USG + 2 USG in 3rd and 5th ANC visits and even more USG if needed + Health&#xD;
      education; pictorial flip chart showing danger sign during pregnancy and potential risks for&#xD;
      unnecessary caesarean delivery to increase awareness for safe delivery) for all the enrolled&#xD;
      pregnant mothers. In the control centres, Investigators will collect information from the&#xD;
      pregnant mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are expecting the pregnant women who will receive antenatal care with&#xD;
      ultrasonography and health education will have reduced number of unnecessary C/S compared to&#xD;
      control group who will not receive those.&#xD;
