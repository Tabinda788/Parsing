  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, active control, single dose escalation&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD)&#xD;
      profiles of P1101 in 48 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives were to determine the safety and tolerability of single ascending&#xD;
      subcutaneous doses of P1101 and to determine the pharmacokinetics of P1101 in single&#xD;
      ascending subcutaneous doses of P1101 in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives were to evaluate the occurrence of side effects in healthy subjects&#xD;
      receiving either P1101 or PEGASYS; to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters for P1101 and&#xD;
      PEGASYS; and to assess the effect of P1101 on the biomarkers 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase&#xD;
      and neopterin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 48 subjects were enrolled to receive subcutaneous injection of P1101 in the dose&#xD;
      level of 24 , 48 , 90 , 180 , 225 , or 270 mcg or to receive subcutaneous injection of 180&#xD;
      mcg Pegasys.&#xD;
