  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with intestinal stomas can have, despite development of better ostomy products,&#xD;
      problems with leakage which influence their quality of life negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome this, Coloplast has developed a new supporting ostomy product called Heylo™,&#xD;
      which has an adhesive sensor layer that should be placed underneath the baseplate. The sensor&#xD;
      layer consists of an electronic sensor system that continuously detects moisture and output&#xD;
      leakage underneath the baseplate. A transmitter connected to the sensor layer continuously&#xD;
      evaluates the incoming information and sends a status to a smartphone software application,&#xD;
      which based on a predefined flow decides which information to deliver to the user about the&#xD;
      baseplate status.&#xD;
