  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of cenegermin (rhNGF) ophthalmic&#xD;
      solution at 20 mcg/mL concentration administered three times daily for 4 weeks in patients&#xD;
      with severe Sjogren's dry eye disease (DED) who are under chronic treatment with topical&#xD;
      Cyclosporine A (CsA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4 week phase III, multicenter, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of cenegermin ophthalmic solution at 20 mcg/mL solution versus vehicle,&#xD;
      in patients with severe Sjogren's dry eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening all procedures for inclusion will be performed. From the day of&#xD;
      screening the patients will stop any kind of further treatment, except CsA and commercially&#xD;
      available preservative free artificial tears provided by Sponsor for a period of 7 days and 9&#xD;
      days. At the end of the washout period , patients meeting the entry criteria for this study&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 and treated for 4 weeks with either cenegermin ophthalmic solution 20&#xD;
      mcg/mL TID or vehicle TID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to topical CsA eye drops (both groups will continue with topical CsA eye drops,&#xD;
      or other topical ophthalmic treatment of the same class), during the 4 weeks of masked&#xD;
      treatment only the administration of IMP is allowed. During the follow up period, the patient&#xD;
      can administer additional artificial tear eye drops, provided by Sponsor, only if strictly&#xD;
      needed, and must document in the patient's diary the number of additional drops administered&#xD;
      for each eye. Patients will then be followed up for efficacy and safety endpoints until week&#xD;
      16 and for safety endpoints until week 24. The total duration of the study is 25 weeks&#xD;
      including 1 week of screening.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Schirmer I test (without anesthesia) &gt;10mm/5min in the eligible eye</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Schirmer test is used in ophthalmic examination to measure tear production for the diagnosis of conditions such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca and dry eye.&#xD;
Without previously instilling anesthetic drops, the Schirmer strip is inserted into the lower conjunctival sac at the junction of the lateral and middle thirds, avoiding touching the cornea, and the length of wetting strips in millimeters is recorded after 5 minutes.&#xD;
The patients will be instructed to close their eyes gently. After 5 minutes have elapsed, the Schirmer test strip will be removed and the length of the tear absorption on the strip will be measured (millimeters/5 minutes)&#xD;
Cutoff values:&#xD;
&lt;5 mm - pathologic dry eye 5-10 mm - marginal dry eye &gt;10 and &lt;30 mm - normal secretion</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in SANDE global score</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire is a short questionnaire to evaluate both dry eye intensity and frequency by using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The patient symptoms of ocular dryness and/or irritation were quantified on the scale based on two questions that assessed both the severity and frequency of symptoms.&#xD;
The SANDE score is calculated by taking the square root of the product of the frequency of symptoms score and the severity of symptoms score. The SANDE scale ranges from 0 to 100 with 100 being the maximal amount of dry eye symptoms and 0 being the minimal amount of dry eye symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Cornea and conjunctiva vital staining with fluorescein (National Eye Institute [NEI] scales</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The NEI/Industry Workshop guidelines are used for grading the scale of corneal and conjunctival damage. The cornea is divided into five sectors (central, superior, inferior, nasal and temporal), each of which is scored on a scale of 0-3, with a maximal total corneal staining score of 15.&#xD;
Both nasally and temporally, the conjunctiva is divided into a superior paralimbal area, an inferior paralimbal area, and a peripheral area with a grading scale of 0-3 and with a maximal total score of 9 for the nasal and temporal conjunctiva (overall the total score ranged from 0-18).&#xD;
Briefly, grade 0 reflects normal/healthy situation, whereas grade 3 reflects a severe damage in the considered sector.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film break-up time (TFBUT) is the time taken to appear first dry spot on cornea after a complete blinking. TFBUT measurement is an easy and fast method used to assess the stability of tear film. It is a standard diagnostic procedure in the dry eye clinics. TFBUT is measured by determining the time to tear break-up. The TFBUT is performed after instillation of 5 μL of 2% preservative-free sodium fluorescein solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. The patient is instructed to blink several times to thoroughly mix the fluorescein with the tear film.&#xD;
A TFBUT greater than 15 seconds is considered normal, while a break time of less than 10 seconds is to be considered pathological.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (IDEEL) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>IDEEL assesses quality of life, symptoms and treatment effects on patients with dry eye.&#xD;
The IDEEL contains 3 modules (Daily Activities, Treatment Satisfaction, and Symptom Bother) with a total of 57 questions.&#xD;
The Daily Activities Module is the quality of life instrument. It is comprised of 27 items.&#xD;
The IDEEL Treatment Satisfaction and Bother Module is divided into 2 sections, Treatment - In General and Treatment - Eye Drops.&#xD;
The Symptom Bother Module consists of 20 items in a single content domain, Symptom Bother.&#xD;
Scores for each dimensions ranged from 0 to 100.&#xD;
Higher scores for:&#xD;
dimension of the Dry Eye Impact on Daily Life module indicates less impact on daily activities; symptom-bother dimension indicates greater bother due to symptoms; satisfaction with Treatment Effectiveness dimension indicates greater satisfaction with treatment effectiveness; treatment-related bother/inconvenience indicates less treatment-related bother or inconvenience.</description>

    <measure>Incidence and frequency of Adverse Events (AEs) and Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs),</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening day ( Day 8) up to Follow-up week 24 (day 168 +/-7days)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.&#xD;
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) are undesirable events not present prior to medical treatment, or an already present event that worsens either in intensity or frequency following the treatment.</description>
