      AIGI (Adaptive Immune Response to Seasonal Influenza Vaccination) is a prospective clinical&#xD;
      study aiming at elucidating the kinetics of vaccine-specific antibody production after&#xD;
      seasonal Influenza vaccination in health care workers at the Greifswald University hospital.&#xD;
      Participants were recruited before their intended vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received the influenza vaccine Vaxigrip Tetra 2020/2021 by Sanofi Pasteur&#xD;
      Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the study, volunteers donate peripheral blood by venipuncture on the day of&#xD;
      vaccination as well as 7 and 14 days after vaccination. EDTA plasma and peripheral&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared and stored at -20 °C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are also asked to complete a standardized questionnaire on each day of blood&#xD;
      sampling. Questionnaires collect data about physical characteristics, seasonal influenza&#xD;
      vaccinations, current infections, medication, immune relevant diseases and side effects of&#xD;
      the vaccination.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Serum antibody titers represent a cumulative measure of any preceded or recent immune responses. The current antibody production can be quantified using MENSA (medium enriched for newly synthesized antibodies), an approach that measures antibodies released from recently stimulated circulating antibody-secreting plasmablasts.&#xD;
For this purpose PBMCs are collected from the subject's whole blood sample, washed to remove serum antibodies, and then cultured for 7 days. Antibodies released ex vivo from the antibody-secreting plasmablasts can now be detected in the culture supernatant. These newly synthesized antibodies are a measure of the instantaneous antibody response.&#xD;
Sampling is conducted on the day of the vaccination.</description>
