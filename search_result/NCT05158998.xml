  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium in older adults is a common and costly complication after surgery.&#xD;
      Propofol and sevoflurane are commonly used anesthetics to maintain sedation during spine&#xD;
      surgery, and have different sedative and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this trial&#xD;
      will be compare the impact of propofol versus sevoflurane on incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      delirium in elderly patients after spine surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spine surgery is the third most common surgical procedure in older patients. With the&#xD;
      increasing number of older patients undergoing spinal surgery, the risk of delirium after&#xD;
      spinal surgery is currently expected to increase. The pathophysiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      delirium remain poorly understood, leading models include neurotransmitter imbalance and&#xD;
      neuroinflammation. Among precipitating factors, drugs (especially sedative hypnotic agents&#xD;
      and anticholinergic agents), surgery, anesthesia, high pain levels, anemia, infections, acute&#xD;
      illness, and acute exacerbation of chronic illness are the most commonly reported. Propofol&#xD;
      and sevoflurane are commonly used anesthetics to maintain sedation during spinal surgery, and&#xD;
      induce unconsciousness through different mechanisms. Meanwhile, previous studies have found&#xD;
      that propofol and sevoflurane have different anti-inflammatory effects. Given their different&#xD;
      sedative and anti-inflammatory effects, propofol and sevoflurane may have different effects&#xD;
      on postoperative delirium. There are many studies to explore the effects of propofol and&#xD;
      sevoflurane on postoperative delirium, but the conclusions are controversial. Therefore, a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical study was designed to compare the impact of&#xD;
      propofol and sevoflurane on delirium after spine surgery in elderly patients.&#xD;
