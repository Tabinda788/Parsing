      This pilot study is a randomized control trial to test the effects of a 14-week home-based&#xD;
      virtual, interactive high intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise intervention on&#xD;
      cardiometabolic and cognitive outcomes in sedentary youth with overweight/obesity during&#xD;
      adolescence. All participants (N=24) will complete screening via phone to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive a) 14 weeks of a home-based&#xD;
      HIIT intervention delivered via iPad or b) 14 weeks of a stretching intervention (control&#xD;
      group). Each participant will undergo an in-lab pre- and post-test visit, where they will&#xD;
      complete a fasting blood draw, a fitness test, and various cognitive and mental health&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Existing literature supports the premise that physical activity (PA) has&#xD;
      beneficial effects on cognitive function in youth, but prior studies have limitations, such&#xD;
      as cross-sectional designs with limited insights on the intensity or duration of PA or the&#xD;
      biological underpinnings linking physical activity and mental health and cognitive function&#xD;
      in adolescents. A limited number of studies (and none in the U.S.) have evaluated the effects&#xD;
      of HIIT on cognitive processes in youth, particularly in youth with overweight/obesity whose&#xD;
      age-related declines in PA puts them at increased risk for poor outcomes. This study is&#xD;
      particularly timely during the current COVID-19 related public health crisis because our HIIT&#xD;
      exercise intervention is time efficient, delivered remotely, and completed using&#xD;
      space-efficient equipment in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants (youth ages 12-16 years with overweight/obesity) will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to complete a) 14 weeks of a home-based virtual, interactive HIIT intervention or b)&#xD;
      14 weeks of a stretching intervention (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Purpose: The overall goal is to improve cognitive and cardiometabolic outcomes in&#xD;
      youth with overweight/obesity by implementing an at-home HIIT intervention. The aims of this&#xD;
      study are: 1) to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of HIIT in&#xD;
      adolescents with overweight/obesity, 2) to examine the effectiveness of HIIT on cognitive and&#xD;
      mental health outcomes, and 3) to examine the effectiveness of HIIT on cardiometabolic&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: This study will consist of youth ages 12-16 years with overweight/obesity&#xD;
      (BMI &gt;=85th percentile) who do not meet current PA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology: This pilot study is a randomized control trial to test the effects of a&#xD;
      14-week home-based virtual, interactive high intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise&#xD;
      intervention on cardiometabolic and cognitive outcomes in sedentary youth with&#xD;
      overweight/obesity during adolescence. All participants (N=24) will complete screening via&#xD;
      phone to determine eligibility. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive a) 14&#xD;
      weeks of a home-based HIIT intervention delivered via iPad (HIIT group) or b) 14 weeks of a&#xD;
      stretching intervention (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to the HIIT group will receive the intervention 3 times/week and will be&#xD;
      given a pre-assembled stationary bicycle to use to complete each exercise session, an iPad to&#xD;
      Zoom with the exercise trainers, and a Fitbit to assess real-time heart rate. Exercise&#xD;
      trainers will provide encouragement and supervision for exercise prescription adherence and&#xD;
      youth will select an age-appropriate music playlist from Spotify to enhance enjoyment&#xD;
      throughout each session. Each exercise session consists of a 5-minute warm-up (10% HRmax),&#xD;
      followed by a 20-minute HIIT protocol. The 20-minute HIIT protocol consists of seven bouts of&#xD;
      1-min high intensity exercise (90% HRmax) followed by 2-min of active recovery (10% HRmax).&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged to complete each exercise session with at least 24 hours of&#xD;
      rest between each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to the control group will perform a home-based program of the same stretches&#xD;
      utilized in the exercise group. The stretching protocol consists of one set of 4 static&#xD;
      stretching exercises held for 30 seconds and performed 3 days/week. As flexibility exercises&#xD;
      are low-intensity, low-impact and low-volume, minimal caloric expenditure is expected to be&#xD;
      incurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arms: Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the HIIT&#xD;
      intervention (HIIT group) or receive the stretching intervention (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints/Outcomes: The primary cognitive and mental health endpoints are: executive&#xD;
      function, episodic memory, working memory, affect, mood, anxiety, stress, self-efficacy for&#xD;
      PA, and PA enjoyment. The primary cardiometabolic endpoints are: glucose, insulin (to&#xD;
      calculate Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance), IL-6, IL-1, TNF-a, and VEGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: The populations for analyses include the full analytical dataset which&#xD;
      consists of all randomized study participants.&#xD;
