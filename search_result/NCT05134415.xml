  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the impact of within-flavor category (tobacco and&#xD;
      menthol) differences in e-liquid flavors on product use behaviors, nicotine uptake, and&#xD;
      subjective effects by current ENDS consumers when used in a closed-system electronic nicotine&#xD;
      delivery system (ENDS).&#xD;
