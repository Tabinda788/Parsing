      The study of LVGN7409-201 is designed to use a bridging dose escalation to quickly establish&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) as well as&#xD;
      the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) of LVGN7409 as a single agent (monotherapy) in the&#xD;
