      This is a randomized, controlled education-based interventional study without any&#xD;
      investigational product. Study subjects are randomized to the intervention or control groups&#xD;
      with a follow-up period of 12 weeks. 250 toddlers between ages 24 and 28 months with&#xD;
      first-time primary caregiver (mother or father) from low to mid-income families in Indonesia&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive scientific literature demonstrates that childhood happiness can be nurtured through&#xD;
      positive and responsive parenting strategies, and is associated with optimal child&#xD;
      development and is a predictor of future happiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Grow Happy program is a translation of scientific literature into parent-friendly&#xD;
      educational materials and actionable tips and advice aimed at improving parental knowledge&#xD;
      and child happiness through parenting techniques and play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the Grow Happy Program is scientifically validated, it has yet to be clinically&#xD;
      tested. It is hypothesized that the Grow Happy program will improve mothers' knowledge and&#xD;
      self-confidence related to parenting behaviors that promote happiness and optimal child&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
