      Conventional open surgery has been shown to be an effective procedure for LCS decompression.&#xD;
      Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) through tubular retractors is a recently introduced&#xD;
      alternative procedure for decompression of LCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims at evaluating the efficacy of minimally invasive surgery as a&#xD;
      decompressive procedure in comparison to conventional open surgery for the treatment of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar canal stenosis (LCS) is defined as narrowing of the spinal canal, the vertebral&#xD;
      foramina, and/or the lateral recesses, causing compression on the nearby neurologic&#xD;
      structures. Degenerative LCS is one of the most common reasons for old patients to undergo&#xD;
      spinal surgery. Neurogenic claudication is the most common symptom for LCS patients. The&#xD;
      patients complain of pain or discomfort that radiates to the buttock, thigh and lower limb&#xD;
      after walking for a certain distance, therefore leading to functional disability and&#xD;
      decreased walking capacity. Conservative management is the first line of treatment in the&#xD;
      absence of progressive neurologic deficit or intractable pain, consisting of physical&#xD;
      therapy, medications (analgesics, steroids) and pain management procedures. Surgical&#xD;
      intervention is recommended if the symptoms are persistent or worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various techniques are currently used for direct decompression of LCS. Conventional open&#xD;
      surgery involves laminectomy that has been shown to be an effective procedure for LCS&#xD;
      decompression. However, wide laminectomies disturbs the stability of bony and ligamentous&#xD;
      structures and may exacerbate preexisting spondylolisthesis. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS)&#xD;
      through tubular retractors is a recently introduced alternative procedure for decompression&#xD;
      of LCS. This technique avoids detachment of the paraspinal muscles and may promote&#xD;
      preservation of stabilizing ligamentous and bony spinal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims at evaluating the efficacy of minimally invasive surgery as a&#xD;
      decompressive procedure in comparison to conventional open surgery for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with LCS.&#xD;

    <description>Change of Oswestry disability index (ODI) is being assessed to compare the pre and post operative values.&#xD;
This outcome measure is designed to assess function in activities of daily living for those with acute or chronic back pain.&#xD;
The ODI consists of 10 patient-completed questions in which the response options are presented as 6-point Likert scales. Scores range from 0% (no disability) to 100% (most severe disability).</description>

    <description>Change of visual analogue scale (VAS) is being assessed to compare the pre and post operative values. VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line, usually 10 centimeters in length.
