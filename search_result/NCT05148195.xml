  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-cohort, multicenter Phase II study, the purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy and safety of envofolimab in combination with BD0801 injection&#xD;
      with/without chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with antivascular agents has been&#xD;
      preliminarily demonstrated in a variety of solid tumors. Based on the huge clinical needs,&#xD;
      the efficacy of envofolimab combined with BD0801 in patients with advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and advanced colorectal cancer deserves further&#xD;
      exploration.&#xD;
