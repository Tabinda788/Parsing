    <textblock>
      This double-masked multi-center trial will evaluate the association of diabetes in the cornea&#xD;
      donor with transplant success and loss of endothelial cells one year following Descemet&#xD;
      membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK). Study eyes will be assigned to receive either a&#xD;
      cornea from a donor without diabetes or a cornea from a donor with diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will address concerns about the suitability of corneas from donors with diabetes&#xD;
      for use with DMEK through a prospective, masked, multi-center clinical trial in which the&#xD;
      donor corneas are assigned by diabetes status in the same distribution proportion (2:1&#xD;
      distribution of tissue from donors without diabetes to tissue from donors with diabetes)&#xD;
      currently used in the USA. The DEKS will assess graft success and endothelial cell density&#xD;
      through 1 year following DMEK to determine whether the surgical success rate with corneas&#xD;
      from donors with well characterized diabetes (including post-mortem hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)&#xD;
      and advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) testing) is inferior to the rate with donors without&#xD;
      diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that the majority of donor corneas from individuals&#xD;
      with diabetes will be suitable, but that a portion of donors with a higher diabetes severity&#xD;
      scale, and/or poorer control based on HbA1c will have a greater risk for graft failure and&#xD;
      endothelial cell loss. This study will also examine collected skin biopsies to determine&#xD;
      whether high levels of AGE biomarkers in donor skin tissue - which quantifies disease&#xD;
      severity over many years (and possibly coupled with elevated HbA1c levels) - is associated&#xD;
      with greater risk for graft failure and cell loss. This novel approach to characterization of&#xD;
      donor tissue can provide a paradigm shift in the risk assessment of transplanted corneas from&#xD;
      diabetic donors. The effect of recipient diabetes on keratoplasty success and cell loss will&#xD;
      also be studied in a rigorous manner to determine the potential combined effect of donor and&#xD;
      recipient diabetes status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this study is designed to determine if non-diabetic donor corneas are superior to&#xD;
      diabetic donor corneas in terms of both graft success and endothelial cell density outcomes,&#xD;
      with an additional specific aim to determine whether donors with a higher diabetes severity&#xD;
      scale, and/or poorer control based on HbA1c are driving the effect. This study will also&#xD;
      determine whether a high AGE/A1c metric is also associated with the potential superiority&#xD;
      finding and establish a novel composite score (severity score, HbA1c and AGE/A1c) based on&#xD;
      these metrics that can be used to identify high versus low risk diabetic donors. This&#xD;
      distinction may enable eye banks to potentially utilize the majority of donors with diabetes&#xD;
      for EK surgery, while excluding the severely affected donors with diabetes.&#xD;
