  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problematic Internet Use (PIU) is an emerging mental health issue. Research consistently&#xD;
      shows that university students are disproportionately vulnerable to experiencing PIU, and&#xD;
      that this can be linked with both poorer academic performance and mental health outcomes.&#xD;
      Despite these adverse consequences, there has been no research to date on treatments for&#xD;
      those experiencing PIU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary research suggests that one promising candidate is mindfulness meditation.&#xD;
      Mindfulness is a popular form of brain training that helps develop an ability to sit with&#xD;
      uncomfortable thoughts and emotions, break compulsive behavioural patterns and make more&#xD;
      mindful behavioural choices. The current proof-of-concept study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      clinical potential of mindfulness meditation in reducing PIU severity for Australian&#xD;
      university students who endorse moderate to severe PIU symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Problematic Use of the Internet (PUI) is an umbrella term encapsulating excessive and&#xD;
      uncontrolled engagement with internet-related activities. PIU is increasingly recognised as&#xD;
      an emerging mental health issue. It is characterised by a perceived loss of control over&#xD;
      internet use despite repeated attempts to regulate it, and excessive internet-specific&#xD;
      preoccupations or urges that result in distress and life impairment. Research consistently&#xD;
      shows that university students are disproportionately vulnerable to experiencing PIU, and&#xD;
      that this can be linked with both poorer academic performance and mental health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these adverse consequences, there has been no research to date on treatments for&#xD;
      those experiencing PIU. Preliminary research suggests that one promising candidate for&#xD;
      addressing PIU is mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness is a popular form of brain training&#xD;
      that helps develop an ability to sit with uncomfortable thoughts and emotions, break&#xD;
      compulsive behavioural patterns and make more mindful behavioural choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a proof of principal investigation. The primary aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of a brief mindfulness meditation intervention for PIU among Australian university&#xD;
      students who endorse moderate to severe PIU. The study will investigate a 30 day combination&#xD;
      of daily meditation practice using the Headspace Inc supported by weekly online group&#xD;
      meditation tuition. In order to support participant engagement in the meditation practices, a&#xD;
      range of behaviour change techniques will be applied. A secondary is to evaluation the&#xD;
      efficacy of these behaviour change techniques in support engagement.&#xD;
