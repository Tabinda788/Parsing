  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include daily SenseGuard measurement of patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      exacerbations of COPD. from admission to discharge. In parallel clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      patient's respiratory condition was done daily by routine tests and questionnaires.&#xD;

      A study for evaluating the feasibility of SenseGuard in assessing the respiratory condition&#xD;
      change of hospitalized patients with exacerbation of COPD, by monitoring respiratory&#xD;
      parameters. The study duration for each patient will start at the time of enrollment until&#xD;
      the patient is released, or until the optional post-discharge follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include at least one visit per day: The visit and measurement with SenseGuard&#xD;
      will start prior to the first medical exacerbation treatment effect-onset given on each study&#xD;
      day (by inhalation or IV). The measurement with SenseGuard will be done before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the investigator discretion, additional two similar visits could be performed on the same&#xD;
      study day, with or without the admission of the medical exacerbation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, both the investigator and the patients will be asked to fill questionnaires&#xD;
      to assess the patient's condition Additionally, measurements that are performed and collected&#xD;
      as a standard practice or at the request of the medical personnel as part of patient's&#xD;
      treatment course shall be documented and used as a reference for the study device assessment.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>SenseGuard</intervention_name>
    <description>SG is a wireless, wearable medical device, which includes nano-based sensors. It can seamlessly measure patient's tidal breathing during daily activities. SG extracts series of critical respiratory parameters, including; Respiration Rate (RR), Inhalation and Exhalation duration and ratio (I/E), as well as novel biomarkers. SG parameters are applicable to evaluate COPD patients' condition, or for monitoring patients with other respiratory conditions.&#xD;
SG components are:&#xD;
RSM (Respiratory Sensing Module): non-invasive module with sensors that can detect the exhaled humidity and condensation. The RSM is a non-sterile, disposable, single patient use.&#xD;
ECU (Electronic Control Unit): a re-usable, wireless data acquisition and transmission unit. The ECU is connected to the RSM during the measurement and transmits the data via Bluetooth to the SG software.&#xD;
SenseGuard™ Software: for data management, acquisition, processing, logging and presentation of the digital respiratory signals.</description>
