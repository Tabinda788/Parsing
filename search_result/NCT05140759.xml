  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the functionality and tolerability of an automated continual water&#xD;
      removal system in up to 8 patients with HF and diuretic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      intervention: Implanted absorption chamber, connected to an external pump. Follow up: 3&#xD;
      months post activation.&#xD;

      Study Duration: 24 months Enrolment 20 months, Follow-up 3 months, Close-out 1 month Study&#xD;
      Centres Up to 4 centres with Medical University Wroclaw, Poland, as the principal site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the feasibility, tolerability and functionality of an intra-peritoneal,&#xD;
      mechanically induced, ultrafiltration system, through the analysis of procedure and device&#xD;
      related serious adverse events and device function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: Up to 8 Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Patients with fluid&#xD;
      overloaded congested heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) with diuretic resistance and a history&#xD;
      of multiple heart failure related admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product and Planned Use: The Paragate Medical IPUDx System comprises an&#xD;
      intraperitoneally implanted fluid absorption chamber with an external wearable rechargeable&#xD;
      pump, drainage bag and controller. The system induces isotonic fluid loss across the&#xD;
      peritoneal membranes which is collected in the fluid absorption chamber and transported to&#xD;
      the external fluid drainage bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology: No statistical hypothesis is proposed. Safety will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a complete description of Serious Adverse Events. A descriptive analysis will be&#xD;
      performed for all primary and secondary variables of the study for the basal measures and all&#xD;
      post-basal measures.&#xD;

    <description>KCCQ-12 questionnaire&#xD;
The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a 23-item self-administered questionnaire developed to independently measure the patient's perception of their health status, which includes heart failure symptoms, impact on physical and social function, and how their heart failure impacts their quality of life (QOL) within a 2-week recall period.&#xD;
KCCQ scores are scaled from 0 to 100 and frequently summarized in 25-point ranges, where scores represent health status as follows: 0 to 24: very poor to poor; 25 to 49: poor to fair; 50 to 74: fair to good; and 75 to 100: good to excellent.</description>
