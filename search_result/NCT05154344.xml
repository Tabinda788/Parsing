      CapmATU study will evaluate time to treatment failure, progression-free survival, overall&#xD;
      survival, best response and safety in patients with advanced MET-dysregulated non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer who received capmatinib as part of an expanded access program. Those outcomes&#xD;
      will be correlated to clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capmatinib has been approved in the USA and Japan. In France, a compassionate use for&#xD;
      capmatinib has been approved in June 2019 for patients with MET alterations, including&#xD;
      METex14 mutations and MET amplification. In March 2021, 204 patients are or have been treated&#xD;
      with compassionate use capmatinib as part of this program, most of them (n=175) harboring a&#xD;
      METex14 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, data on activity and safety of new-generation MET TKIs are still sparse and only&#xD;
      based on prospective clinical studies. The CapmATU study is a unique opportunity to describe&#xD;
      patients' characteristics and outcomes, and confirm effectiveness of capmatinib in a large&#xD;
      cohort of METex14 NSCLC. Moreover, it will provide original real-world evidence (RWE). RWE&#xD;
      can be used in oncology to further characterize the safety and efficacy of drugs in the&#xD;
      post-marketing setting. This may include confirmation of clinical benefit for regulatory&#xD;
      purposes, expansion of labeling claims to new indications, testing of alternate doses and&#xD;
      schedules of drugs, and assessment of drug activity in biomarker-defined subgroups and other&#xD;
      special populations. This may be even more important in the context of METex14 NSCLC patients&#xD;
      since no real world data with new generation MET TKIs have been reported so far. Indeed, this&#xD;
      study will allow to determine whether the antitumor activity of capmatinib reported in the&#xD;
      GEOMETRY-MONO-1 study can be observed in less selected patients. Given the older age and&#xD;
      associated comorbidities of METex14 NSCLC patients, most of them may not be eligible to a&#xD;
      clinical trial, thus emphasizing the need for real-world evidence. Finally, the biological&#xD;
      part of this study (CapmATU-BIO) will offer opportunity to identify biomarkers of sensitivity&#xD;
      or acquired resistance to capmatinib, which is a poorly explored field of research so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the objectives of this non-interventional retrospective French&#xD;
      population-base study are to describe the characteristics of patients with MET-dysregulated&#xD;
      NSCLC, assess effectiveness and safety of capmatinib in these patients and identify&#xD;
      biomarkers of benefit from capmatinib.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
             NSCLC (Stage IIIB or IV accordingly to American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC]&#xD;
             classification) at time of capmatinib initiation&#xD;

          -  Presence of a MET dysregulation diagnosed on tumor sample and/or on liquid biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who were informed about the study and accepted for their data to be&#xD;
             collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received at least one dose of treatment with capmatinib as part of the&#xD;

             interventions were not considered appropriate or acceptable).&#xD;
