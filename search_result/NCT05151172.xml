  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke occurs when a blood clot causes a blockage in a blood vessel (artery) within the&#xD;
      brain. This type of stroke is called an ischemic stroke and carries a high risk of disability&#xD;
      or death. Stroke must be treated very fast. Any delay of even 10 minutes can result in the&#xD;
      difference between an independent and a disabled outcome, and in some cases between life and&#xD;
      death. Endovascular therapy (EVT) or Thrombectomy is a procedure to remove the blood clot&#xD;
      (thrombus) from a blood vessel to reopen it (recanalization). Patients are likely to benefit&#xD;
      from a thrombectomy procedure when it is performed in a larger blood vessel. Currently it is&#xD;
      not known if thrombectomy procedure will benefit the patients presenting with the stroke that&#xD;
      has been caused by a blood clot in a medium sized blood vessel (medium vessel occlusion,&#xD;
      MeVO). This trial will enrol patients diagnosed with acute stroke due to a clot in the medium&#xD;
      sized vessel. The patients will be randomized within 12 hours of their symptom onset to&#xD;
      either standard of care or standard of care plus thrombectomy procedure. The participation&#xD;
      will last for 12 months Escape MeVO coordinating centre is located at the University of&#xD;
      Calgary. There will be approximately 50 sites. We will be recruiting a total of 530 patients.&#xD;

      ESCAPE-MeVO is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open- label study with blinded&#xD;
      endpoint evaluation (PROBE design). Participants will be randomized to routine best medical&#xD;
      stroke care governed by current guidelines (control group) or to EVT plus best medical care.&#xD;
      EVT will be performed with one of the Solitaire group of intracranial stent-retriever devices&#xD;
      (Solitaire X, Medtronic) as the first line approach according to the manufacturers'&#xD;
      specifications for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with clinical symptoms of acute stroke, last seen normal within the last 12 hours,&#xD;
      and with either NIHSS ≥ 5 or NIHSS 3-5 due to disabling symptoms in the judgement of the&#xD;
      stroke team shall undergo imaging to identify the MeVO and assess the status of the affected&#xD;
      brain parenchyma. As is being currently practiced across different stroke centers, imaging&#xD;
      may follow different imaging paradigms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Option 1: NCCT + mCTA (first phase covers intracranial and extracranial vessels)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Option 2: NCCT + mCTA/spCTA + either mCTA tissue level perfusion maps or CTP perfusion&#xD;
           maps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Option 3: DWI-MRI + MRA (of both the intracranial and extracranial vessels). Approach to&#xD;
           the EVT procedure and technique will be at the discretion of the interventionist and&#xD;
           team, with the exception that the first thrombectomy attempt is performed with one of&#xD;
           the Solitaire group of intracranial stent-retriever devices (Solitaire X, Medtronic).&#xD;
           Available, approved off-the-shelf, secondary devices may be used if reperfusion success&#xD;
           is not achieved after use of the first device, at the discretion of the&#xD;
           neuro-interventionalist&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of one 90-day study period for each participant. Participants will be&#xD;
      hospitalized for care after their acute stroke according to the current standard of care.&#xD;
      Participants are required to return to clinic on Day 90 for end-of-study assessment.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will receive the best standard of medical care according to modern acute stroke care guidelines. In the intervention/experimental arm, participants will be treated with endovascular thrombectomy with a Solitaire device (Medtronic) as the first line approach. The trial mandates that the first attempt is performed with a Solitaire X device (3mm, 4mm or 6mm diameter devices; Medtronic). The remaining treatment technique is left to the discretion of the treating neurointerventionalist. Secondary devices may be used if success is not achieved after use of the first device.</description>

          9. The following depend on the imaging modality of the participating site:&#xD;
&#xD;
        9a. NCCT + mCTA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Well demarcated hypodensity in the majority of the brain parenchyma supplied by the&#xD;
