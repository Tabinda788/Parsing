  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has three objectives about persons with Parkinson's Disease during bicycling:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of visual feedback and competition during virtual bicycling on&#xD;
           neuromuscular and cardiovascular intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effect of visual-feedback and competition during virtual bicycling on the&#xD;
           user experience of motivation, enjoyment &amp; perception of exercise intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if attention differs during visual feedback compared to competition virtual&#xD;
           bicycling&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will attend one sessions lasting about 2-3 hours. They will complete movement&#xD;
      assessments and questionnaires about physical activity. They will then exercise exercise in&#xD;
      three different virtual reality augmented bicycling conditions while wearing a head mounted&#xD;
      display (goggles). Each of the three conditions will last approximately 8 minutes and will be&#xD;
      followed by questionnaires about the participant's experience.&#xD;
