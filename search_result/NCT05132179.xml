  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      202 Diabetic foot ulcers will be cleaned with either Hypochlorous Acid, HClO or&#xD;
      Polyhexamethylene biguanide, PHMB twice a week until healed or 24 weeks. Primary objective is&#xD;
      to find out if cleaning DFU with HClO is more effective in obtaining complete healing than&#xD;
      PHMB.&#xD;

      202 persons with diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers, DFU will be randomized to treatment with&#xD;
      either Hypochlorous Acid, HClO or Polyhexamethylene biguanide, PHMB. The study is double&#xD;
      blind and controlled. The cleaning will be done as instruction for PHMB, twice a week until&#xD;
      complete healing of the DFU or if not healed 24 weeks. Complete healing is defined as intact&#xD;
      skin covering the place where there was an ulcer. Primary objective is time to healing, if&#xD;
      cleaning DFU with HClO is more effective in obtaining complete healing of DFU than PHMB.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to examine if HClO compared with PHMB differ when treating DFU with&#xD;
      respect to: a. Proportion of DFU that heals within 12 weeks of treatment, b. The size of the&#xD;
      DFU´s surface area over 24 weeks of treatment, c. The depth of the DFU over 24 weeks d. The&#xD;
      use of antibiotics over 24 weeks of treatment, e. The quality of life using EQ-5D&#xD;
      questionnaire. Explorative objectives are to examine if HClO compared with PHMB differ when&#xD;
      treating DFU with respect to: a. Change in healing pattern (sub study in Västra Götaland), b.&#xD;
      Change in microbiological variables (sub study in Västra Götaland), c. The quality of life&#xD;
      using SF-12 questionnaire, d. Cost effectiveness and other health-economical aspects&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy analysis of difference in time to healing from randomisation up to 24 weeks between the two randomised groups. Analysis will be performed using Cox regression. The healing date will be defined as the first visit when the ulcer is fully covered with skin.</description>

    <description>The size of surface area measured with a mm ruler in photo of the DFU. The surface area of The DFU will be measured weekly for 24 weeks or until healed from weekly photo with a mm ruler in the photo. The calculation of the area will be done by a person not involved in the treatment. For each participants and time point, the percentage change of the ulcer size (area and volume) will be calculated in relation to randomisation. For each group (HOCl and PHMB, respectively), the average change in ulcer size (area and volume) will be calculated, whereafter any difference between the two groups will be examined for statistical significance.</description>

For each participant and time point, the percentage change of the ulcer size (area and volume) will be calculated in relation to the date of randomisation. For each group (HOCl and PHMB, respectively), the average change in ulcer size (area and volume) will be calculated, whereafter any difference between the two groups will be examined for statistical significance.</description>
