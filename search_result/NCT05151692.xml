        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs and 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are any abnormalities, they&#xD;
             must be assessed as not clinically significant by the investigator and this&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal&#xD;
             reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the&#xD;
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) level must be greater than (&gt;) the lower limit of normal&#xD;
             at screening&#xD;

             between 18 and 27.9 kilograms per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive), and body weight&#xD;
             not less than 50 kg and less than or equal to (&lt;=) 110 kg at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum&#xD;
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at Week 0 prior to administration of&#xD;
             study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to nipocalimab or its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum albumin below the lower limit of normal at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication (including vitamins and herbal&#xD;
             supplements), except for paracetamol, acetaminophen, contraceptives, and hormonal&#xD;
             replacement therapy within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug is&#xD;
             scheduled until completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had major surgery, (example: requiring general anesthesia) within 12 weeks before&#xD;
             screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned&#xD;
             during the time the participant is expected to participate in the study or within 8&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of study intervention administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active, acute or a chronic infection (examples: bronchiectasis, chronic&#xD;
             osteomyelitis, chronic pyelonephritis) or requires chronic treatment with&#xD;
             anti-infectives (examples: antibiotics, antivirals)&#xD;
