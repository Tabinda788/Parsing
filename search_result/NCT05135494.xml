  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is high in individuals after a stroke. There&#xD;
      are few studies evaluating the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in individuals&#xD;
      with OSA and the findings regarding the possible effect on Apneia/Hipopneia Index (AHI)&#xD;
      reduction are still controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the hypothesis that training of the inspiratory muscles is effective in&#xD;
      improving severity of OSA, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in individuals after stroke&#xD;
      participating in a rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: For this prospective, sigle blinded, randomized clinical trial, people after stroke&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control groups. The experimental group&#xD;
      will undertake training of the inspiratory muscles with the PowerBreath Medic Plus regulated&#xD;
      at 75% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) values, five times/week over five&#xD;
      weeks 5 sets of 5 repetitions with 1 set increasing each week. Both groups will participate&#xD;
      in the rehabilitation program and will receive the same dose of physiotherapy, speech therapy&#xD;
      and aerobic exercise sessions. At baseline and post intervention after the cessation of the&#xD;
      interventions, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect all outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes: Primary outcome will be OSA severity measured using the Apnea/Hypopnea Index&#xD;
      (AHI). Secondary outcomes will include inspiratory endurance and pressure, functional&#xD;
      independence, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is high in individuals after a stroke. The&#xD;
      gold standard treatment for OSA is the use of Positive Airway Pressure, but due to the low&#xD;
      adherence to this resource, the multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of OSA is&#xD;
      becoming the best therapeutic option. There are few studies evaluating the effects of&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in individuals with OSA and the findings regarding the&#xD;
      possible effect on Apneia/Hipopneia Index (AHI) reduction are still controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:The primary objective of this study is to identify the effects of IMT on the severity of&#xD;
      OSA in indivuals after stroke participating in a rehabilitation program. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to identify effects of IMT on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness and analyze&#xD;
      the correlation between severity of OSA and functional independence, inspiratory endurance&#xD;
      and pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: For this prospective, sigle blinded, randomized clinical trial, people after stroke&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control groups. The experimental group&#xD;
      will undertake training of the inspiratory muscles with the PowerBreath Medic Plus regulated&#xD;
      at 75% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) values, five times/week over five&#xD;
      weeks 5 sets of 5 repetitions with 1 set increasing each week. Both groups will participate&#xD;
      in the rehabilitation program and will receive the same dose of physiotherapy, speech therapy&#xD;
      and aerobic exercise sessions. At baseline and post intervention after the cessation of the&#xD;
      interventions, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect all outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes: Primary outcome will be OSA severity measured using the Apnea/Hypopnea Index&#xD;
      (AHI). Secondary outcomes will include inspiratory endurance and pressure, functional&#xD;
      independence, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness&#xD;
