  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new way of measuring the peripheral vision (called a&#xD;
      visual field test) using a device which can be worn as goggles rather than being a large&#xD;
      instrument the patient must sit at. This new visual field test (called VisuALL) is an&#xD;
      FDA-approved virtual reality system which has been used in adults and children. This study&#xD;
      will compare the performance of the VisuALL to the standard testing for peripheral vision,&#xD;
      which is called the Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit both healthy children, as well children and young adults who have eye&#xD;
      conditions which require visual field testing as part of their standard care. The test will&#xD;
      be performed on a day when the child or young adult already has a scheduled eye appointment&#xD;
      as standard care. The test does not touch the eyes or require any eye drops to be given, and&#xD;
      there is no known risk associated with the test itself. There may be a risk of loss of&#xD;
      confidentiality. Participating in this study will require approximately 30 minutes, has no&#xD;
      extra cost associated with it, and will be compensated by a parking pass for the day of the&#xD;
      visit. There are no direct benefits for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected participants will be also be given training and then loaned a home VisuALL system to&#xD;
      allow home visual field testing. If your child is selected, additional information would be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
