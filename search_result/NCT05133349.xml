  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study of an investigational drug, anlotinib in participants&#xD;
      with advanced malignant paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma&#xD;
      (PPGL) are tumors originating from the adrenal medulla or adrenal diplomatic sensory chain,&#xD;
      respectively, which can synthesize and secrete large amounts of catecholamines. In this&#xD;
      study, participants whose disease has advanced or spread despite prior standard therapy, will&#xD;
      receive anlotinib for 2-weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, until disease progression&#xD;
      (PD) or drug toxicity intolerance. Anlotinib is an investigational drug, which has been shown&#xD;
      to shrink tumours in several tumour models. The study will evaluate the efficacy as well as&#xD;
      the toxicity profile of anlotinib when used as an alternative treatment for participants with&#xD;
      PPGL tumours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single arm, open-label, phase II trial of anlotinib in participants with&#xD;
      metastatic or locally advanced malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Oral anlotinib&#xD;
      (12 mg) will be administered to all participants daily for the first 2 weeks of a 3-week&#xD;
      study cycle, followed by a 1 week rest. Participants will be assessed for response to study&#xD;
      treatment using MRI/CT scans as well as bio-chemical tests, and will receive the study&#xD;
      treatment for up to 12 months or until disease progression.&#xD;
