  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is a disease specific, quality of life patient reported outcome measures (PROMS) for patients with shoulder instability. Patients use visual analog scales (VAS) to rate physical symptoms and impacts of the condition/treatment on sports/recreation/work, lifestyle, and emotions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder dislocation and recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dislocation requiring reduction by a physician (ED) or surgery. Dislocations will be identified in two ways: 1) if the patient seeks treatment from the surgeon, the surgeon will notify the research coordinator who will document it accordingly, or 2) at each research postoperative examination, the research staff will ask patients if they experienced a dislocation or subluxation. These will be considered alongside the definition of recurrence from Kasik et al. that also includes subluxation, or positive findings during physical examination for shoulder instability (apprehension).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical complications, re-operations and revision surgeries</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical complications will be documented at the time of surgery and at each postoperative interval. A surgical complication is defined as any undesirable, unintended and direct result of an operation affecting the patient that would not have occurred had the operation gone well as could reasonably be hoped (Sokol and Wilson, 2008) (i.e., infection, dislocation, neurological injury, and fracture (including periprosthetic and acromial fracture).&#xD;
Revision surgery and re-operations will be documented, including the reason for failure, date of revision/reoperation, and the procedure performed. Revision is defined as a change of an original component (partial or complete replacement). Re-operation is defined as any surgical procedure other than a revision.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Isokinetic Internal and External Rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Internal and external rotation strength will be determined with an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). With the arm in 90 degrees shoulder abduction and elbow flexion and positioned in the scapular plane, patients will complete coupled concentric and eccentric shoulder internal and external rotation within a 90 degrees range of motion (-40 degrees internal rotation to 50 degrees external rotations). Three maximal effort (instructed to contract as hard and as fast as they can) repetitions will be completed at velocities of 60 and 180 degrees per second, with one-minute rest between testing speeds. Average peak torque of the three repetitions will be recorded for both IR and ER.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Athletic Shoulder (ASH) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient Is positioned prone with a foam block in place to support their forehand. The test is completed in three positions termed &quot;I&quot;, with the arm positioned in 180 degrees of shoulder flexion, &quot;Y, with the arm positioned in 135 degrees of shoulder abduction, and &quot;T&quot;, with the arm positioned in 90 degrees of abduction. In each position, the palm of the hand rests on a force plate (AMTI, MA, USA). The patient will complete a warm-up of two submaximal attempts in each position to 80-90% maximal effort, then three maximal effort trials for each limb in each test position (I, Y, T), with 20 seconds rest between repetitions. For each repetition, subjects will be instructed to push against the plate as hard and as fast as possible for three seconds. Peak and mean force across the three attempts and positions will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seated medicine ball toss</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will start the test in the seated position with the legs extended in front of their body, and the head, shoulders and back firmly against a wall. They will then attempt a &quot;chest pass&quot; by throwing a 10 lbs. medicine ball as far as they can. Four trials will be completed with 30 sec rest between each trial. Maximum distance will be recorded and averaged, once adjusted for arm length (distance of the ball from the wall with the arm held at 90 degrees of flexion and full elbow extension).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posterior Shoulder Endurance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient starts positioned in prone towards one edge of a plinth, with the arm held in 90o shoulder flexion, perpendicular to the floor. Holding a weight of 2% of total body weight, the patient will attempt to raise the weight to 90 degrees of horizontal abduction, holding for one second at this position before returning to the starting position (tempo of 30 bpm). The test is terminated when the patient is fatigued as indicated by 1) the inability to hold the mid position for one second and 2) using compensatory movements of the torso, or patient request to terminate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plyometric Push up</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will start in a push up position with each hand extended in front of the shoulders and positioned on an individual force plate. When cued, the participant will lower their body to the ground by flexing at the elbow until their sternum is 3 cm from the floor. They will then forcefully extend at the elbow and propel their body into the air above the plate. During landing, the subjects will be instructed to reduce the impact as much as possible and continue for two additional repetitions. Three repetitions will be completed. Peak ground reaction forces during impact, peak rate of force development (RFD) during the concentric phase will be averaged from the three repetitions and expressed as a limb symmetry index (injured/uninjured * 100%).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single arm seated shot put</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will start seated in an 18&quot; chair without arm rests, with the legs positioned in front of their body, extended to rest straight onto an additional chair. The non-throwing arm will be placed across the chest, with a strap placed diagonally around the upper body to secure the subject to the chair. The patient will &quot;put&quot; (like shot put), and not &quot;throw&quot; (like baseball) the 6 lb. ball from shoulder height for maximal distance. Three maximal effort attempts will be recorded after a graded warm-up of four &quot;puts&quot; at 25, 50, 75 and 100% estimated effort. Thirty seconds rest will be provided between maximal attempts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>

    <description>A PROM where patients categorize the frequency (i.e. never, once a month, etc.) of certain activities of the upper extremity (i.e. carrying objects 8 lbs. or heavier by hand) and also identify whether they participate in either contact or overhead sports including the level of participation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Pain and Medication Use</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain will be self-reported on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) in a logbook. Medication type and quantity will also be documented. The Postoperative Pain and Medication Logbook has been previously used by the authors in an ACL population.</description>
