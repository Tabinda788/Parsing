      Hypothesis: Is it feasible to conduct a definitive trial to test the effect of E-MATVR&#xD;
      compared to E-MATE on primary and secondary outcomes among Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA)&#xD;
      members (players and coaches)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial&#xD;
      to test the effect of an educational intervention to Enhance Men's Awareness of Testicular&#xD;
      diseases using Virtual Reality (E-MATVR) among male GAA members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of E-MATVR will be compared to E-MATE (control) which involves using the same&#xD;
      information as E-MATVR delivered as plain text (e.g., PDF) with still images from E-MATVR.&#xD;

      1. Overall aim&#xD;
&#xD;
           To examine the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial to test the effect of&#xD;
           E-MATVR (intervention) compared to Electronic information only, E-MATE (control) on&#xD;
           testicular knowledge and testicular self-examination behaviours among male Gaelic&#xD;
           Athletic Association (GAA) members (i.e., players and coaches) over three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to Eldridge and colleagues, &quot;feasibility study&quot; is an umbrella term including&#xD;
           randomised/non-randomised pilot studies and/or other feasibility studies aimed to&#xD;
           determine whether a definitive trial can be done, should be done, and if so, how? To&#xD;
           answer these questions, we will conduct a feasibility trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Negotiate access with key stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Identify unforeseen problems and safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Examine randomisation and blinding processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Provide estimates for sample size calculation for definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomised feasibility trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Biological males&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Members of the target GAA clubs since testicular injuries are common in field&#xD;
                sports like hurling.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Residing in Ireland.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Aged 18-50 years (age group at risk for testicular diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. History of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. History of motion sickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be collected in six geographically dispersed GAA clubs, including &quot;Healthy&#xD;
           Club&quot; https://www.gaa.ie/my-gaa/community-and-health/healthy-club/).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention described below using the template for intervention description and&#xD;
           replication (TIDieR) checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1 Brief name&#xD;
&#xD;
           E-MATVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2 Why?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Limitations from our previous research were (i) the inclusion of men from one&#xD;
           university; (ii) short follow-up time; (iii) lack of randomisation/control group; (iv)&#xD;
           lack of an economic evaluation; and (v) lack of process evaluation. These will be&#xD;
           addressed in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3 What?&#xD;
&#xD;
           E-MATVR is a computer software uploaded onto VR technology and delivered using a&#xD;
           headset, handheld controllers, and voiceover (all wireless). The voiceover script is&#xD;
           based on evidence from our prior research and the Preconscious Awareness to Action&#xD;
           theoretical framework. The script's readability score (83.4 on the Flesch-Kincaid test)&#xD;
           indicates its suitability for sixth Graders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           E-MATVR comprises three gaming levels and takes approximately 10min to complete. The&#xD;
           user is required to complete one level to move to the next level. E-MATVR begins with a&#xD;
           scrolling series of words (like opening movie credits) as the voiceover reads them out.&#xD;
           These include light-hearted synonyms for the testes (e.g., balls, nuts, gonads). The&#xD;
           word &quot;nuts&quot; rather than &quot;testes&quot; is used to engage men with this intimate/sensitive&#xD;
           topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Level 1 involves a 3D space with two walnuts. The user is asked by the voiceover to&#xD;
                move around the walnuts using the controllers, while providing facts about the&#xD;
                normal size and shape of the testes. Three changes (lump, swelling, and pain&#xD;
                [represented as flashing light]) then appear consecutively. These are accompanied&#xD;
                with a humorous emotional response from the voiceover. The user must find all three&#xD;
                changes to move to the next level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Level 2: A 3D model of a testis is used and the spermatic cord, epididymis, and&#xD;
                tumour are represented. The user is loaded into Level 2 on top of the testis.&#xD;
                During this level, the voiceover links symptoms experienced in Level 1 to&#xD;
                testicular structures. The spermatic cord lights up to indicate testicular torsion&#xD;
                and a purple lump appears, indicating a growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Level 3: Key messages are reiterated by the voiceover using three icons: (i) a&#xD;
                snowflake to remind participants that their testes are unique and highlight the&#xD;
                importance of knowing what is normal for them; (ii) an infographic with the method&#xD;
                for testicular self-examination; and (iii) a red cross to prompt participants to&#xD;
                seek help for abnormalities and seek immediate attention for severe testicular&#xD;
                pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.4 Who provided?&#xD;
&#xD;
           E-MATVR was developed by Mr Eoghan Cooke (Collaborator and Research Assistant) within an&#xD;
           MSc in Interactive Media supervised by Mr David Murphy (Co-Applicant). A Research&#xD;
           Assistant (Mr Billy O'Mahony) with interactive media expertise will test E-MATVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.5 How?&#xD;
&#xD;
           E-MATVR is delivered using the latest VR technology (Oculus Quest 2&#xD;
           https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/) to give users a life-like experience, with imbedded&#xD;
           headphones and controllers that provide vibrational (haptic) feedback based on&#xD;
           participants' actions. The use of VR is explained, and participants are exposed to a&#xD;
           brief demonstration to practice the use of the technology. Participants are then exposed&#xD;
           to E-MATVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.6 Where?&#xD;
&#xD;
           E-MATVR (wireless) will be tested in the target GAA clubs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.7 When?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will complete E-MATVR once. E-MATVR takes approximately 10min to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.8 How much?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The number of VR users worldwide was 171 million in 2018, as compared to 200,000 in&#xD;
           2014. Worldwide spending on VR and augmented reality will grow between 2019-2023,&#xD;
           achieving a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 77% and delivering a 294 billion USD boost to&#xD;
           global Gross Domestic Product by supporting education and training. VR device ownership&#xD;
           and purchase intent are highest among men aged 18-39yrs. The surge in VR use led to&#xD;
           significant price drops. High-quality VR equipment is available for €138-€462&#xD;
           (https://www.oculus.com/compare/).&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.9 Tailoring/Modifications&#xD;
&#xD;
           Should a newer VR technology emerge, the E-MATVR software can be readily transferred in&#xD;
           full onto it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.10 How well?&#xD;
&#xD;
           User-friendliness, acceptability, and effectiveness (one-group pre-post pilot) of&#xD;
           E-MATVR were tested with 68 university students. Participants perceived E-MATVR as fun,&#xD;
           innovative, informative, memorable, and user-friendly. E-MATVR was successful in&#xD;
           increasing men's knowledge of testicular diseases, intentions to seek help for symptoms,&#xD;
           and testicular self-examination behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Control&#xD;
&#xD;
           E-MATE (E for Electronic information) will serve as the control arm. It involves using&#xD;
           the same information as E-MATVR delivered as plain text (e.g., PDF) with still images&#xD;
           from E-MATVR. Participants will be given 10min to read the text/look at images using an&#xD;
           iPad.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.1 Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Testicular knowledge (Dichotomous)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Testicular self-examination behaviours (Dichotomous)&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.2 Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Testicular awareness (Likert scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Help-seeking intentions (Likert scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Implementation intentions (Likert scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Perceived risk of testicular disorders (Likert scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), immediately post-test (T1), and three months&#xD;
           post-test (T2) using the Castor EDC software (https://www.castoredc.com/).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Research Assistant and/or Research Support Officer will be present to ensure&#xD;
           participant safety. There is no in-person follow-up. Participants will be contacted&#xD;
           (phone call/text message/email) to ensure completion of outcome measurement at T2.&#xD;
           Non-respondents and those who withdraw will be considered lost to follow-up. Retention&#xD;
           is key to ensuring power and internal validity. This will be addressed in the SWAT&#xD;
           described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given that the goal of a feasibility trial is to identify problems that would impede the&#xD;
           conduct of a larger, definitive efficacy trial, we have set the sample size at 59 based&#xD;
           on advice from Viechtbauer et al. (2015) which is aimed at being able to detect failures&#xD;
           in study processes that would occur just 5% of the time (with 95% confidence). Bearing&#xD;
           in mind a potential attrition rate of 25%, 74 participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Randomisation and allocation concealment&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each of the six participating GAA clubs, individual participants will be randomised&#xD;
           with the same probability to one of the two arms (E-MATVR/E-MATE). Allocation&#xD;
           concealment will be maintained using a computerised system. Once participants have&#xD;
           consented and their baseline assessment has been entered into the computer database,&#xD;
           their allocation will be given by automated email. Randomisation and allocation&#xD;
           concealment will be conducted according to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) of&#xD;
           the Statistics and Data Analysis Unit of the HRB Clinical Research Facility-Cork (HRB&#xD;
           CRF-C).&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the differences between the two arms, participants will be aware of the arm they&#xD;
           have been randomised into. Outcome assessments will be self-reported and returned to&#xD;
           research staff with no information on allocation. Blinding will be maintained throughout&#xD;
           data analysis. Unblinding will be facilitated by the independent statistician following&#xD;
           completion of the protocol-specified data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses will be conducted by the lead statistician, under the SOPs of the Statistics&#xD;
           and Data Analysis Unit of the HRB CRF-C. Before recruitment, a detailed Statistical&#xD;
           Analysis Plan will be uploaded alongside the study protocol to the relevant registries.&#xD;
           Data will undergo extensive quality checking and potential errors will be verified from&#xD;
           source data a priori.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses of outcomes will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Differences in&#xD;
           outcomes by study arm, over time, will be estimated using generalised linear mixed&#xD;
           effects models with the appropriate link function (based on the distribution of the&#xD;
           outcome or expected error distribution). We will report minimally adjusted models, which&#xD;
           will include effects of intervention arm and time. We will report a fully adjusted model&#xD;
           that includes the key predictor variables collected at baseline. Missing data will be&#xD;
           evaluated and addressed using appropriate methods (e.g., multiple imputation or&#xD;
           inverse-probability weighting). Effect estimates for all pre-specified primary and&#xD;
           secondary endpoints, will be publicly reported with 95%CI and exact p-values, in&#xD;
           accordance with recent guidance from the American Statistical Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses will be conducted using transparent, open-science tools. All analysis steps,&#xD;
           including cleaning or modifications to study database, will be fully scripted and&#xD;
           replicable. Scripts for the key analyses will undergo testing prior to data analysis.&#xD;
           Upon completion, the study database will be prepared according to FAIR data principles&#xD;
           and be made available along-side the analysis scripts.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in line with ethical principles depicted in the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. Ethical approval will be sought from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee at UCC.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with an information leaflet and will sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to check with their General Practitioner for abnormalities (e.g.,&#xD;
      lump) identified during testicular self-examination. They will also be asked to visit the&#xD;
      emergency department for sudden and severe testicular pain which is often associated with&#xD;
      emergencies such as testicular torsion.&#xD;
