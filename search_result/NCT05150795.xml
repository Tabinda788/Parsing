  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregabalin is a structural analogue of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). It binds to&#xD;
      presynaptic alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage gated calcium channels in the brain and the&#xD;
      spinal cord. Thus, it modulates the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as&#xD;
      glutamate, norepinephrine, substance-P, and calcitonin gene related peptide. Also, it causes&#xD;
      inhibitory modulation of overexcited neurons and restores them to a normal state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-emptive analgesia aims to reduce postoperative opioid consumption especially in&#xD;
      ambulatory surgeries. Pregabalin (PGB) is an emerging drug in this field. Different doses of&#xD;
      preoperative oral pregabalin (75, 150 and 300 mg) are described in the literature with a&#xD;
      dose-response analgesic relationship and reduction of opioid use; however increasing the dose&#xD;
      results in increasing the incidence of side effects mainly sedation and dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative use of opioids for analgesia may result in side effects; like nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      excessive sedation, respiratory depression, pruritus, and urinary retention.The concomitant&#xD;
      use of opioids with pregabalin may result in excess sedation and somnolence, so, the use of&#xD;
      opioids with pregabalin should be limited to patients with inadequate alternative options.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our study aims to compare the postoperative analgesic effect of pre-operative oral pregabalin&#xD;
      (Study group), to the intraoperative intravenous fentanyl (Control group) in diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patienrs will be selected by simple randomization by computer generated system. Pregabalin&#xD;
      150 mg oral capsule and a placebo capsule will be available on the morning of operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, 2 syringes of 10 ml volumes will be prepared; the first contains normal saline and the&#xD;
      second contains the fentanyl dose of 1 µg /kg calculated according to the patient's body&#xD;
      weight and diluted to a 10 ml volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be divided into 2 equal groups of 40 patients each:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group P: Patients will receive oral pregabalin capsule (150 mg) 90 min before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia, and will receive a bolus injection of 10 ml saline at induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group F: Patients will receive oral placebo capsule identical to the trial drug in size,&#xD;
      shape and color, 90 min before induction of anesthesia and will receive a bolus injection of&#xD;
      10 ml of 1µg /kg fentanyl at induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
