      The study CLOU064C12302 consists of an initial Core Part (CP) (maximum duration per&#xD;
      participant of up to 30 months), followed by an Extension Part (EP, of up to 5 years&#xD;
      duration) for eligible participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Core Part is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator-controlled,&#xD;
      fixed-dose, parallel-group, multi-center study in approximately 800 participants with&#xD;
      relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Extension Part is an open-label, single-arm, fixed-dose design in which eligible&#xD;
      participants are treated with remibrutinib for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second study of identical design (CLOU064C12301) will be conducted simultaneously. Both&#xD;
      studies will be conducted globally and data from the two studies will be pooled for some of&#xD;
      the endpoints.&#xD;
