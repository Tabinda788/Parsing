  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients are reportedly at higher risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
      (POCD).The authors hypothesized that the incidence of POCD would be affected by several&#xD;
      factors including, the age of the patient, the degree of cerebral oxygenation, type of&#xD;
      anesthesia administered, majority of surgery and the patient position during surgery.The&#xD;
      investigators examined the relationship between all the previous parameters and (POCD).&#xD;

      105 patients 65 years or older and scheduled for lumbar spinal surgery will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Enrolled patients have either degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis or spinal cord tumor. The&#xD;
      planned surgical procedures will be all performed in the prone position using the Wilson&#xD;
      frame with the head and neck in the neutral position and included laminectomy and discectomy,&#xD;
      spinal fusion, and (when present) removal of the spinal cord tumor. Written informed consent&#xD;
      for participation in this study will be obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened within 1 week before the scheduled surgery. Details and medical&#xD;
      comorbidities, Inclusion criteria were as follows: elective spine surgery in prone position,&#xD;
      60-75 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score of I,II or&#xD;
      III, and body mass index (BMI) ranging from 22 to 45 kg/m2 , patients should have a&#xD;
      sufficient level of education to be capable of completing neuropsychological tests; a&#xD;
      pre-operative mini mental state examination (MMSE) score ≥23. Exclusion criteria were as&#xD;
      follows: preexisting neuropsychiatric disorders or inability to correctly perform&#xD;
      neurocognitive tests on the patient, emergency operation, diagnosis of coma, depression,&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, cardiovascular, respiratory or central nervous system disease, renal or&#xD;
      hepatic dysfunction or serious hearing or visual impairment;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, Patients were monitored by 5 lead electrocardiogram, invasive arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure (IABP) through the arterial catheter and (Masimo®, Irvine, CA) which provides&#xD;
      non-invasive continuous technologies for monitoring and measuring many physiological&#xD;
      variables such as arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR) and hemoglobin&#xD;
      concentration (Hb%), end tidal CO2, noninvasive blood pressure, body temperature, (O3 ®,&#xD;
      Masimo, Irvine, CA) attached to the patient to provide continuous monitoring of regional&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the two sides by a near-infrared spectroscopy sensors.&#xD;
      (SedLine ®, Masimo, CA) brain function monitoring by Patient State Index (PSI) which is a&#xD;
      processed EEG parameter affected by the anesthetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided into three groups 35 each; group I: anesthesia maintained by&#xD;
      sevoflurane, group II: anesthesia maintained by desflurane, and group III: anesthesia&#xD;
      maintained by TIVA. In all groups the doses of anesthetics were adjusted to maintain (Psi)&#xD;
      (patient sensitivity index) between 25-50% measured by (SedLine, Masimo®, CA) rocuronium&#xD;
      boluses were given to maintain stable neuromuscular block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was managed according to a standardized protocol that was identical for each&#xD;
      group. Following 3 min of pre-oxygenation (with 100 % O2), anesthesia was induced by slow&#xD;
      intravenous injection of propofol (1-2 mg/kg), fentanil (1-μg /kg). Tracheal intubation was&#xD;
      facilitated with Rocrunium (0.4-0.6mg/kg) Mechanical ventilation was initiated with a tidal&#xD;
      volume of 7 ml/kg, a respiratory rate of 12 /min, a positive end expiratory pressure of 5&#xD;
      cmH2O and inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2 to maintain PETCO2 in the range 35-40 mmHg.&#xD;
      Oxygen flow rate was set at 2 l/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was maintained in the three Groups by sevoflurane , desflurane, and propofol to&#xD;
      target PSI to 25-50 fentanyl 100μg/h and boluses of rocrunium were used to supplement&#xD;
      maintenance of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' demographic and basic clinical characteristics, fluid balance, blood loss, duration&#xD;
      of surgery, temperature, time taken for recovery of spontaneous breathing, eye opening on&#xD;
      command and time taken for extubation were also recorded. HR, mean arterial pressure (MAP)&#xD;
      and central venous pressure were recorded at five perioperative time points: on entering the&#xD;
      operating room (T0); before tracheal intubation (T1); before surgery (T2); immediately after&#xD;
      surgery (T3) and immediately after tracheal extubation (T4). . In the operating room,&#xD;
      patients were laid in the supine position, and a The patient's baseline rSO2 data were&#xD;
      acquired before anesthetic induction while the patient breathed room air. The&#xD;
      anesthesiologists and surgeons were blinded to the rSO2 data, which wererecorded at 30-second&#xD;
      intervals on the device's accessory disk drive for later analysis. No interventions were&#xD;
      attempted based on the device. Both the right and the left frontal rSO2 values wererecorded&#xD;
      simultaneously, and the lower value of either side werecollected for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of perioperative cognitive function The MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      (MoCA) were used to assess cognitive function the day before surgery and seventh&#xD;
      postoperative day. All data collectors had undergone standard training, and were blinded to&#xD;
      the randomization status of the participants. The MMSE consists of tests of orientation (in&#xD;
      time and place), memory (immediate and short-term), calculation, language (naming,&#xD;
      repetition, listening and reading comprehension, writing), visual spatial awareness,&#xD;
      concentration and attention, and is suitable for detecting more severe cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
      The MoCA tests visuospatial and executive function (alternate trail making test, copy the&#xD;
      cube, clock drawing), language ability, attention and calculation, delayed recall and&#xD;
      abstract thinking, and can detect milder cognitive dysfunction. Patients' cognitive function&#xD;
      was evaluated by MoCA if the MMSE score equaled or exceeded 23.&#xD;
