  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims at comparing three group treatments designed for eating disorders: a&#xD;
      Cognitive-dissonance, a Mindfulness and a Person-centered based programs. Women with eating&#xD;
      disorders will be recruited and randomized to one of the three programs. Participants will&#xD;
      complete a pretest, a posttest, a 3-months follow-up and a 1-year follow-up. This trial aims&#xD;
      to compare the programs to analyze the specific dimensions upon which each program acts. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore made hypotheses according to the programs' theory: participants in&#xD;
      the Cognitive-dissonance based program should experience a greater decrease in eating&#xD;
      disorders symptoms, thin-ideal internalization and body dissatisfaction and a greater&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life than other participants. Participants in the Mindfulness-based&#xD;
      program should show a greater improvement in negative affect and in equanimity than other&#xD;
      participants. Participants in the Person-Centered based program should report a greater&#xD;
      increase in congruence than other participants.&#xD;
