      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the efficacy of Sitagliptin would reduce the incidence of grade II-IV&#xD;
      acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) by day +100 post-transplant in patients undergoing&#xD;
      alternative donor (related haploid or unrelated donor ) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation and receiving standard GVHD prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following descriptive secondary objectives will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the tolerability and potential toxicity of sitagliptin in patients undergoing&#xD;
           allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD by day +100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the cumulative incidence of grades III-IV acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate the engraftment kinetics of absolute neutrophil count and platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the incidence of CMV, EBV and other infections occurring during the 100 days&#xD;
           post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To study non-relapse mortality (NRM) at day +100, and 1 year post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Determine the overall survival at 1 year post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Determine the cumulative incidence of relapse of the primary hematological malignancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, Multi-center, Open-label, Randomized, Controlled clinical trial of&#xD;
      Sitagliptin for the prevention and safety of aGVHD after Alternative Donor hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      190 adult patients with hematologic malignancies receiving haploid or unrelated donor sourced&#xD;
      HSCT are planned to be enrolled competitively in this study from 5 clinical centers in China.&#xD;
      These patients will be randomly assigned to two groups of 95 patients each, which one is&#xD;
      experimental group and the other is control group. 95 patients in experimental group will&#xD;
      receive Sitagliptin combined with Standard prophylaxis for GVHD. 95 patients in the control&#xD;
      group will receive Standard prophylaxis regimen for GVHD of Alternative Donor HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group uses ATG+CSA+MMF+MTX for GVHD prophylaxis with the details as follows: CSA&#xD;
      3mg/kg continuous i.v. drip, start before Day -7, change to p.o. when gastrointestinal&#xD;
      function recovers with a dose of 5mg/kg as two divided doses, maintaining CSA within&#xD;
      150-250ng/ml（If CsA cannot be tolerated, tacrolimus may be used as an alternative.）; MTX&#xD;
      15mg/m2,Day +1, 10mg/m2,Days +3, +6, and +11; MMF 0.5g BID, starting from Day -7 to day +30&#xD;
      for one month; ATG 2.5mg/kg/d, Day -4 to Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group will take Sitagliptin orally from d-1 to d+14 in addition to Standard&#xD;
      Prophylaxis Regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the content of dose reduction of CSA (including time and reduction rate), it&#xD;
      is recommended for patients with hematologic malignancies in standard risk group to start to&#xD;
      reduce dose after 3-6 months in the absence of GVHD and reoccurance. The specific reduction&#xD;
      rate can be determined at each site; the patients with GVHD will be managed by routine&#xD;
      practice in this site.&#xD;

    <measure>Development Grade II-IV Acute GVHD at Day +100</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days from transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Fine-Gray and Cause-specific COX methods will be used to conduct a competing risk analysis. Time until grade II-IV acute GVHD will be calculated from transplant through grade II-IV acute GVHD or death from GVHD. Patients who relapsed or died from causes other than GVHD will be considered a competing risk population and calculated from time of transplant until relapse or death.

    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Time to neutrophil engraftment will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The time to engraftment of neutrophils is defined as the time from day 0 to the date of the first of three consecutive days after transplantation during which the absolute neutrophils count (ANC) is at least 0.5 x109/l. Patients who did not have neutrophil engraftment before death will be censored at the date of death. The median and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.</description>

    <measure>Median Time to Engraftment of Platelets</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to platelet engraftment will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The time to engraftment of platelets is defined as the time from day 0 to the first of seven consecutive Complete Blood Counts (CBCs) obtained on different days after transplantation during which the platelet count is at least 20 x109/l. The CBCs obtained should be at least seven days after the most recent platelet transfusion. The median and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.</description>

    <description>Patients surviving at least 100 days will be evaluable for chronic GVHD. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (total, and mild, moderate, severe) will be described using deaths from causes other than chronic GVHD considered as a competing risk. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to conduct a competing risk analysis. Time until chronic GVHD will be calculated from transplant until chronic GVHD or death from GVHD. Patients who relapsed or died from causes other than GVHD will be considered a competing risk and calculated from time of transplant until relapse or death.
