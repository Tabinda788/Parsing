  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a smartphone app in which the tool will be developed and validation&#xD;
      of the tool will be done for the rehabilitation of upper limb in stroke survivors. The study&#xD;
      will be divided into two phases. The first phase will be the development of a smartphone app&#xD;
      for upper limb function. The second phase of the study will be a pilot study where 10 stroke&#xD;
      patients will be recruited and upper limb intervention will be applied through a smartphone&#xD;
      app.&#xD;

    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) quantifies upper limb motor ability through timed and functional tasks. Original WMFT contains 21 items but widely used WMFT contains 17 items.&#xD;
The maximum time allowed for each task is 120 seconds. Each task is rated on a 6 point scale of 0-5 0 means unable to attempt the task while 5 means normal. Lower scores indicate lower functioning levels.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) is used to measure finger dexterity in various neurological conditions.&#xD;
Patients are scored in seconds based on the time taken to complete the activity. The stopwatch should be started from the moment the participant touches the first peg until the moment the last peg hits the container.&#xD;
Alternative scoring - the number of pegs placed in 50 or 100 seconds can be recorded. In this case, results are expressed as the number of pegs placed per second</description>
