  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      3D printing is emerging as a new diagnostic tool for pre-surgical planning. 3D printed models&#xD;
      are extremely advantageous to surgeons in their preoperative planning. Handling these&#xD;
      physical replicas engages active spatial perception skills, enabling a more comprehensive&#xD;
      understanding of the presented information in an inherently intuitive manner that cannot be&#xD;
      achieved with conventional methods of imaging review that use screen based 2D and volume&#xD;
      rendered representations. The investigators are developing a novel technique to create 3D&#xD;
      models derived directly from extremely high-resolution medical images that are superior in&#xD;
      spatial and contrast resolution to current 3D modelling methods. This produces patient&#xD;
      specific models that contain previously unachievable special fidelity and soft tissue&#xD;
      differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the preoperative use of these new diagnostic quality models&#xD;
      will reduce surgical time and improve post-surgical outcomes in the near future. This&#xD;
      prospective project will optimize the quality of these 3D models to create highly useful&#xD;
      pre-surgical models. Investigators will target those subspecialist areas of the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary surgical and imaging team where it is believed these models will have the&#xD;
      most impact. The proposed prospective study has two major goals: 1) Investigate the use of&#xD;
      uncompressed, ultrahigh resolution CT/MR datasets to produce diagnostic 3D models with&#xD;
      identical spatial/contrast resolution to the acquired datasets in the target areas of&#xD;
      congenital cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgical tumor resection and nephrectomy. 2) Compare&#xD;
      the accuracy of this innovative method for 3D printing to radiological images and&#xD;
      pathological data when available.&#xD;

      The tangible outcome of this research will be measured in a comparative study. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the 3D printed models, resulting from the development of this&#xD;
      iterative process of generating models from ultra-high resolution medical images and review&#xD;
      by all parties, to radiological images and pathological data. The study team will employ&#xD;
      non-biased methods to quantify the results of this comparative study. There will be no&#xD;
      randomization and all subjects will receive the same treatments and all outcomes are data&#xD;
      focused. Models will not be used for patient treatment and will be used only as to aid&#xD;
      preparation and will not be used as a therapeutic device. For this reason, the study team&#xD;
      will not prospectively consent subjects.&#xD;
