  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. Those in the intermediate/high-risk&#xD;
      categories typically receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy. ADT greatly&#xD;
      reduces androgen production as prostate cancer is dependent on testosterone and&#xD;
      dihydrotestosterone for its growth.The side effects of ADT therapy are extensive and include&#xD;
      changes in body composition (muscle loss, bone loss and fat gain), strength, mood, physical&#xD;
      function, sexual function and increased cardiovascular risk and fatigue. Many of these side&#xD;
      effects can be influenced by exercise training, both resistance training and aerobic&#xD;
      training. However, the most appropriate exercise regime for men undergoing ADT has received&#xD;
      little research attention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many interventions for prostate survivors emphasise resistance exercise to maintain&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength. Arguments could equally be made for programmes emphasising aerobic&#xD;
      exercise for fatigue, anxiety, cardiovascular risk reduction and indeed overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of programmes that emphasise each exercise mode are clearly required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the overall purpose of this feasibility and pilot randomised control trial is to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an aerobic emphasised exercise&#xD;
      program (AE) verses a resistance emphasise exercise program (RE) in a rehabilitation setting,&#xD;
      over 6 months, for prostate cancer men undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).&#xD;
