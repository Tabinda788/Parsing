      A randomized, open-labeled, blank-controlled and prospective trial meant to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of glibenclamide on acute aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients will allocated&#xD;
      randomly in two groups, one for 3.75 mg daily intake of glibenclamide for 7 days and another&#xD;
      as a blank contrast. General clinical data and late cognitive status will be accessed in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a open-labeled, blank-controlled, prospective and randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      conducted at Tiantan Hospital and Tongren Hospital, affiliated with the Capital Medical&#xD;
      University. Patients will be recruited from intensive care units. Appropriate ethics and&#xD;
      regulatory approvals will be sought for all subjects, according to the International&#xD;
      Conference on Harmonization guidelines for good clinical practice (ICH GCP). Investigators&#xD;
      will obtain informed written consent from all patients or their legal representative.&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place between 2021 and 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either glibenclamide 3.75mg or blank&#xD;
      contrast. A computer-generated randomization code will be used to randomize patients.&#xD;
      Patients will start treatment as soon as possible within 48 h of the stroke, with a daily&#xD;
      dose till the 7 days after the recruitment. Trial medication consisted of one and a half&#xD;
      pieces of tablet a day, given orally or via a nasogastric tube. Aneurysm treatment, either by&#xD;
      microsurgery or embolization, will be performed as soon as possible, according with the&#xD;
      standard of care for the recruiting center. Nimodipine 60mg, every six hours, will be started&#xD;
      on admission and continued till two weeks later, in all patients as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's demographics, medical history and relevant investigation results will be collected.&#xD;
      The severity of the hemorrhage will be clinically assessed by World Federation of&#xD;
      Neurosurgical Societies grading scale and radiologically using the modified Fischer scale. At&#xD;
      90 days of follow up patients will be interviewed with modified Rankin scale (mRS)&#xD;
      questionnaire (a scale that measures degree of incapacity/ dependence and mortality after&#xD;
      neurological events) by a physician with no knowledge of treatment allocation. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that, once compared with standard of care, glibenclamide 3.75mg will provide&#xD;
      better clinical outcome and additionally will decrease mortality and improve quality of life&#xD;
      and cognitive performance after 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Previous studies have shown that the NSE mean for the third day after&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage is 21 ng/ml, the standard deviation is about 3 ng/ml, and the third&#xD;
      day NSE in patients with a good prognosis group is about 19 ng/ml, and the standard deviation&#xD;
      is about 3 ng/ml; according to the two-sided test, significance of 5%, two groups of equal&#xD;
      number of people, 90% of the degree of certainty, the calculation of the sample size of 98&#xD;
      cases, assuming 10% of the loss of visits, the total sample size is expected to be 110 cases.&#xD;
