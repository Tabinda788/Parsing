    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the feasibility of using hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of cervical or endometrial cancer. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers&#xD;
      higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells&#xD;
      and have fewer side effects.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the trial as feasible and to assess the impact upon acute gastrointestinal&#xD;
      toxicity in the third week of pelvic radiotherapy following a hypo-fractionated schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECODARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate impact upon acute urinary toxicity. II. To estimate impact upon patient&#xD;
      reported gastrointestional toxicity. III. To assess acute quality of life following&#xD;
      treatment. IV. To quantify acute financial toxicity following treatment. V. To assess&#xD;
      satisfaction with decision-making following treatment. VI. To assess the overall survival&#xD;
      throughout 3 years of post-treatment follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo hypo-fractionated radiotherapy over 3 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months and then&#xD;
      at 1, 2, and 3 years.&#xD;
