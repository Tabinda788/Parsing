  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational research study aims to answer the question: 'Which aspects of human&#xD;
      biology play an important role in recovery from symptomatic malaria?'&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the researchers aim to identify human genes for which the level of gene&#xD;
      activity reflects the patient's overall rate of recovery. The researchers believe this&#xD;
      approach may reveal new targets for adjunctive therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers aim to recruit 240 people, of all ages, who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      symptomatic malaria at selected hospitals in London. Blood samples, urine samples, and&#xD;
      clinical information will be collected over the 14 days following malaria diagnosis.&#xD;

    <description>The 'composite recovery score' will be calculated by principal component analysis of rates of recovery for individual markers of tissue, organ, or organ system dysfunction, and extraction of the value of the first principal component for each participant. Genes for which expression correlates with the 'composite recovery score' will be identified by whole blood transcriptome analysis.</description>
