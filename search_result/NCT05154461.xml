  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ketone body (KB) ß-hydroxybutyrate will be given to eight fasting healthy volunteers of&#xD;
      both sexes in order to observe the effects after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) over 2&#xD;
      h. Then, a standard lunch will be served at 12.00, as well as an afternoon snack at 15.00.&#xD;
      Each participant will be its own control and participates in a randomised two-way cross over&#xD;
      design; the KB are released in the stomach-duodenum, or in the ileum-colon. Peripheral blood&#xD;
      samples are taken for endpoint GLP-1 analyses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown in man that a fatty diet in people with obesity stimulated the release of&#xD;
      ketone bodies (KB) in the small intestinal mucosa. This observation was partly explained by&#xD;
      an increased level of the ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2)&#xD;
      in the jejunum of the obese people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a peptide that is released from the intestinal mucosa and&#xD;
      mediates among other things, satiation, as well as insulin-secretion and insulin-sensitivity.&#xD;
      In patients with obesity, GLP-1 response to food is attenuated, but it increases following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question arose if the increased KB could be linked to the decreased level of meal-induced&#xD;
      GLP-1. Indeed, in mice and rats the increased production of KB could be related to a&#xD;
      decreased level of GLP-1. However, such a close relationship has never been shown in man.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study tests, therefore, if release of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyric acid&#xD;
      into the intestine on two levels (stomach/duodenum and ileum/colon) of healthy volunteers&#xD;
      influences the blood concentration of GLP-1 following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).&#xD;
      Glucose, insulin and KB are determined in peripheral plasma according to OGTT-routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KB are lipid-derived organic molecules that can serve a circulating energy source during&#xD;
      starvation/fasting (or pronged exercise). Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate (AcAc) and&#xD;
      acetone (&quot;ketone bodies&quot;) are products of acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acids converted to&#xD;
      via hepatic mitochondria. The three KB are connected to each by proteolytic interconnection.&#xD;
      BHB is the most important source of energy, while AcAc is approximately 25-30% of BHB.&#xD;
      Acetone is gas-soluble and is exhaled if ketonemia increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study utilises ingestion of one KB (BHB) to get an acute, rapid increase in&#xD;
      ketonemia. An encapsulation technology is used to differentiate the effect of KB on the small&#xD;
      intestine from the effect mainly in the colon. Microcapsules with 1./ alginate, will release&#xD;
      the KB in proximal stomach/duodenal intestine, and 2./ pea protein will release in the distal&#xD;
      part of the intestine, mainly colon. The microcapsules are of food grade and are produced&#xD;
      according to Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) standards (AnaBio Technologies LTD, Cork,&#xD;
      Ireland). The KB in the microcapsules will contain 18 g BHB- and Ca+, Mg2+. Together with the&#xD;
      encapsulation material (alginate or pea-protein) the total weight will be 20g per dose.&#xD;
