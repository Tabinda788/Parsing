    <intervention_name>COSMED K5 CPET (Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test)</intervention_name>
    <description>In this randomized crossover trial of eligible adults, we will compare peak measurements of oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) during three maximal cardiopulmonary stress exercise tests (CPET), each seven to ten days apart. Subjects will be randomized into either the K5 or ParvoMedics (PM) group for their first CPET using a 1:1 randomization scheme and will serve as their own control in the subsequent test seven to ten days after the previous one. After both a K5 and a PM CPETs have been completed, the participants will complete an additional K5 CPET for test-retest reliability. A within-subjects analysis will be performed.</description>
