    <textblock>
      Research studies continues to attempt testing modifications to refine the treatment protocols&#xD;
      through computer assisted design or computer-generated surgical Wafer splints, have greatly&#xD;
      revolutionized the incorporation of digital imaging and 3D design in Orthognathic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrating computer guided technology in orthognathic surgery aims to to simplify workup and&#xD;
      reduce surgical errors, eliminate occlusal discrepancy, increase the realignment accuracy of&#xD;
      the distal segments according to the preoperative plan. Implementing a waferless technique&#xD;
      raised the question of efficiency versus the use of occlusal wafers and whether it has a&#xD;
      significant measurable effect on the surgical outcome and objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for conducting this study is to assess the difference between the effect of&#xD;
      computer guided waferless technique and computer guided technique with occlusal wafer on&#xD;
      accuracy of postoperative occlusion and condylar position.&#xD;

      The use of waferless orthognathic surgery technique raised the question of efficiency versus&#xD;
      the use of occlusal wafers and whether it has a significant measurable effect on the surgical&#xD;
      outcome and objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modification and attempts to refine the treatment protocols through computer assisted design&#xD;
      or computer-generated surgical Wafer splints, have greatly revolutionized the incorporation&#xD;
      of digital imaging and 3D design in Orthognathic surgery. Combining the knowledge acquired&#xD;
      from later studies with the advancement in 3D design software and increased resolution of&#xD;
      imaging, waferless orthognathic computer guided protocols have been explored and&#xD;
      investigating a more accurate technique is now being competitively pursued. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the 3D printed positioning device to reposition the&#xD;
      Distal segments according to the preoperative virtual plan after BSSO versus final digitally&#xD;
      fabricated interocclusal wafer with distal extension for correction of class II or III&#xD;
      mandibular deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the selected eligible patient population, candidates will be randomly allocated into 2&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (Interventions assessment group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distal segments repositioning using osteotomy/plate locating bone-borne surgical guide&#xD;
      (wafer-less approach).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II (Comparator group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distal segments repositioning using preoperative and final wafers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thorough preoperative assessment of all patients carried out including history taking,&#xD;
      clinical, photographic, and radiographic examinations in addition to dental casts analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative radiographic examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A panoramic radiography will be requested from all patients for preliminary survey to rule&#xD;
      out the presence of any intra-bony pathologic lesions that may interfere with surgery.&#xD;
      Preoperative Computed Tomography (CT) of the head and neck region will be acquired for all&#xD;
      patients utilizing multi-slice CT machine according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Axial slices thickness: 1 mm thick or thinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Distance between slices: 1 mm or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gantry should not be tilted (gantry tilt = 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 2D axial images in DICOM format will recorded in the CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. FOV should be limited, but all the region of interest described in the request should be&#xD;
           included. The patient's mouth should be kept open during CT scanning to ensure the&#xD;
           separation between mandible and maxilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Voxel ratio should be 1:1 (pitch = 1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The window should be standard, in the original format of the CT scanner.&#xD;
