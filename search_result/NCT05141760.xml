  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective phase II study assesses the accuracy of second generation prostate specific&#xD;
      membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET; utilizing 18F-PSMA-1007)) and&#xD;
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for locoregional staging of clinically&#xD;
      significant prostate cancer in men undergoing radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic&#xD;
      lymph node dissection. The design will be a multicenter validating-paired cohort study using&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection as the gold standard comparator. Each&#xD;
      patient will undergo both 18F-PSMA-1007 PET and 3T MRI allowing comparison of each imaging&#xD;
      modality within each subject. Furthermore, PET and MRI will be compared to standard-of-care&#xD;
      imaging techniques (CT abdomen/pelvis and 99mTc-MDP Bone scan).&#xD;
