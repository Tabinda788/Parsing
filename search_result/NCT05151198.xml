      COPD patients often experience multiple symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, cough, and deteriorating&#xD;
      quality of life) and have imposed a substantial economic and social burden on health care.&#xD;

      The current proposal is to explore the information needs of COPD patients and to evaluate the&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the number 3 killer globally by 2020. COPD&#xD;
      patients often experience multiple symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, cough, and deteriorating quality&#xD;
      of life) and have imposed a substantial economic and social burden on health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current policy for the prevention and management of long-term conditions focuses on efforts&#xD;
      to prevent the onset or slow progression of disease early in the disease trajectory. This&#xD;
      prevention paradigm has only recently been adopted for COPD. Systematic reviews have shown&#xD;
      self-management support for patients with COPD is effective in improving health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and in reducing hospital admissions, but the evidence comes largely from&#xD;
      patients with moderate or severe disease and is predominantly recruited from secondary care.&#xD;
      Simple and systematic strategies are needed to improve out-of-hospital support and management&#xD;
      for people living with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An instant messaging smartphone app, which allows texts, audio, pictures and video messages&#xD;
      to be shared in chat groups, is already available to and is the most popular in the Hong Kong&#xD;
      general public. Mobile instant messaging can be conducted through a daily use device to&#xD;
      increase access and efficacy, which has been suggested as a feasible approach to delivering&#xD;
      an intervention with positive effects on health behaviours and outcomes. Text messaging via&#xD;
      mobile phones has been shown to be effective in helping promote lifestyle change in diabetes&#xD;
      self-management, weight loss, physical activity, smoking cessation and medication adherence&#xD;
      with quantitative and qualitative evidence. However, we have not found messaging intervention&#xD;
      that was applied in people with COPD, except an ongoing study of using instant text message&#xD;
      support for patients with chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the current proposal is to use a quantitative survey and qualitative interview&#xD;
      exploring the information needs of COPD patients and evaluating the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a smartphone-based instant messaging self-management support program to&#xD;
      improve the quality of life in patients with COPD.&#xD;
