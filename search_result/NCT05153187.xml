  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational study focusing on patients diagnosed with advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer(ABC) in Japan using de-identified claim data from Medical Data Vision (MDV)&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to describe patient demographics, treatment patterns&#xD;
      and treatment duration of palbociclib, and subsequent treatment patterns and treatment&#xD;
      duration after palbociclib-based therapy among ABC patients in Japan The secondary objective&#xD;
      of the study is to describe patient demographics, treatment patterns of ABC patients and&#xD;
      treatment duration of endocrine therapy, and subsequent treatment patterns and treatment&#xD;
      duration after endocrine therapy among ABC patients in Japan.&#xD;
