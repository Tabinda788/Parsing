  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to enable the investigator to conduct proof of concept work&#xD;
      related to the feasibility, acceptability, initial efficacy and mechanisms of action&#xD;
      (focusing on maternal and infant modifiable factors) for a novel self-management intervention&#xD;
      for pregnant women.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study aims to adapt intervention to address excessive gestational weight gain&#xD;
      and psychosocial functioning among a socioeconomically and racially diverse sample of&#xD;
      pregnant women .Additionally, data on behavioral mechanisms associated with self-regulatory&#xD;
      capacity, such as impulsive control and the ability to delay rewards, that may be linked to&#xD;
      self-regulation during pregnancy are needed to support future interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will develop and adapt an intervention (Self-Management&#xD;
      Around the Reproductive Transition; SMART) that addresses maternal weight, stress, and mood,&#xD;
      and document the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of the SMART intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale will be used to assess depressive symptomatology. A total scores is calculated by finding the sum of the 20 items. Total scores range from 0-60, with higher scores reflecting greater depressive symptomatology.</description>

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale will be administered to measure symptoms of perceived stress. The Perceived Stress Scale score is obtained by summing the points awarded to the 10 items and it ranges from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater perceived stress.</description>

    <description>Counseling sessions will be completed with a toolbox approach so that clinicians can work on topics that are of interest and relevant to each participant. SMART will focus on weight, physical activity, eating and psychosocial issues. Intervention goals will emphasize adherence to healthy behaviors rather than absolute weight goals. Specifically, women will receive consultation about nutritional balance, dietary guidelines for pregnant women and advice to maintain an optimal rate of weight gain according to prepregnancy BMI. Women will use self-monitoring forms to identify and modify cues for unhealthy behaviors. Beliefs about body weight and eating during pregnancy will be addressed and effects of physical activity on body weight, health, and mood will be included.</description>
