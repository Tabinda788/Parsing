    <textblock>
      The year 2020 will be remembered for a cataclysmic event- the coronavirus disease 19 ( COVID&#xD;
      19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID 19 is a serious disease that can significantly affect the daily lives of recovered&#xD;
      patients and their families in terms of mental health problems such as post- traumatic&#xD;
      stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia, as well as the negative impact COVID 19 has on&#xD;
      patients quality of life. Since the patients are not immune to future infection, it may lead&#xD;
      to a more negative impact on patient's quality of life. Health related quality of life is an&#xD;
      important measure that is used for assessing the impact of diseases, disorders, or&#xD;
      disabilities on the physical, mental, and social domains of patients health. The assessment&#xD;
      of health related quality of life (HRQol) helps healthcare providers identify the factors&#xD;
      affecting quality of life (QoL) and recognize the aspects of COVID 19 management that needs&#xD;
      to be enhanced for improving the QoL of patients. COVID 19 infection causes systemic&#xD;
      inflammation leading to a surge on inflammatory mediators in the body that are known to&#xD;
      influence sleep and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic infection related increase in the inflammatory mediators are known to increase the&#xD;
      amount of non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and duration of sleep, perhaps in an attempt to&#xD;
      save energy and counter the infection. However, different infections have varying effects on&#xD;
      sleep. That could be one reason that COVID 19 infection has led to insomnia and worsening of&#xD;
      sleep quality rather than increment in sleep. Not only the sleep quality has been affected&#xD;
      during the COVID 19 pandemic, but pandemic could have led to emergence of sleep disorders as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been persuasively argued as to why elderly persons are more susceptible to contract&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection. Several factors have&#xD;
      been discussed that worsens sleep among the elderly, including aging of the circadian&#xD;
      network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering high prevalence of these disorders, optimal management of these disorders is&#xD;
      important during pandemic not only to reduce the risk of contracting SARS-COV-2 infection,&#xD;
      but also to reduce adverse health consequences related to same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an important area for research as the relationship appears bidirectional, improvement&#xD;
      in sleep may be used to reduce impact of COVID 19 and vice versa.&#xD;
