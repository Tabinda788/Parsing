  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal gait is a common issue in children with CP. As a result of motor weakness and a lack&#xD;
      of voluntary motor control. Furthermore, gait in children with cerebral palsy is&#xD;
      characterized by a slower walking speed, a shorter stride length, and more time spent in&#xD;
      double support. Deficits in postural control constitute a major limitation to the motor&#xD;
      development in children with CP. The performance of static and dynamic tasks, such as&#xD;
      sitting, standing, and walking, is limited in these children due to postural instability.&#xD;
      Postural control deficits in CP are caused by altered sensory processing, motor impairment,&#xD;
      and biomechanical alignment, which result in altered neuromuscular responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBO2 therapeutic benefits in CP are attributed to an increase in dissolved oxygen in plasma&#xD;
      and tissue, which aids tissue regeneration, So, the purpose of this study was to investigate&#xD;
      the long-term effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on spatiotemporal gait parameters and&#xD;
      functional balance skills in children with CP.&#xD;

      This was a randomized clinical trial. Thirty-nine children with spastic cerebral palsy with&#xD;
      ages ranging from 5 to 10 years referred from local pediatric rehabilitation centers&#xD;
      participated in this study. All children were classified randomly using sealed envelopes into&#xD;
      two groups (Control and Study groups). The children in the control group received traditional&#xD;
      physical therapy and the study group received the same traditional physical therapy in&#xD;
      addition to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Written informed consent from the child's legal&#xD;
      guardian was obtained. The study was authorized by the Ethics Committee for Research at Cairo&#xD;
      University in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. PBS was&#xD;
      used to assess functional balance and GAITRite was used to assess spatiotemporal gait&#xD;
      parameters. Measurements of functional balance and spatiotemporal gait parameters were taken&#xD;
      three times: at the start of the intervention, eight weeks later, and six months after&#xD;
      cessation of HPO2 therapy to assess the long-term effect.&#xD;

    <description>Change of balance scores was measured using pediatric balance scale. PBS collect scores for the 14 tasks assessed. The tasks are scored on a five-point scale (0, 1, 2, 3 or 4), with zero denoting an inability to perform the activity without assistance and four denoting the ability to perform the task with complete independence. Score range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating better postural control</description>
