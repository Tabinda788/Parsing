  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-arm phase II clinical study. In patients with stage III-IVA cervical cancer&#xD;
      with pelvic lymph nodes &gt; 2cm, positive para-aortic lymph nodes, or lymph node metastases &gt;&#xD;
      2, patients with positive PD-L1 expression (CPS score ≥1) were treated with cararizumab&#xD;
      combined with conventional concurrent chemoradiotherapy and immunomaintenance therapy for one&#xD;
      year. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of carilizumab in combination with concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy and subsequent maintenance therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient received neoadjuvant therapy once every three weeks for a total of seventeen&#xD;
      cycles. From the first day of treatment, the patient will undergo concurrent chemoradiation&#xD;
      for 5 weeks.The chemotherapy drug is cisplatin or carboplatin every week for 5 weeks. After&#xD;
      the end of concurrent chemoradiation, the patient will continue to use camrelizumab as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy until one year.&#xD;
