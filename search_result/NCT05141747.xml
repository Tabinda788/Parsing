  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MRG002 as single agent in patients with HER2-positive /HER2-low locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic gastric/ gastroesophageal junction cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two cohorts in this study. HER2-positive and HER2-low patients will be allocated to&#xD;
      cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively. When the 20th, 40th, or 60th patient in each cohort&#xD;
      completed at least one post-baseline tumor assessment, the Safety Monitoring Committee will&#xD;
      review the safety and efficacy of these patients to determine dose selection, enrollment&#xD;
      continuation, study population, and sample size.&#xD;
