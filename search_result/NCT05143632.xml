    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension (MAP &lt;65 mmHg) in patients undergoing general anesthesia is a&#xD;
      notable risk factor for the development of post-operative complications including acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI), myocardial injury, stroke and delirium, and is strongly associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality. Moreover, the mean and systolic blood pressure values tend to undergo&#xD;
      significant fluctuations with different positions assumed by the patient during surgery.&#xD;
      Since severe hypotensive phenomena are connected with cerebral hypoperfusion and are&#xD;
      associated with negative outcomes, close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the number of hypotensive episodes, their&#xD;
      quality and their duration in patients monitored with the oscillometric intermittent&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure method compared to patients with continuous noninvasive monitoring&#xD;
      using ClearSight during orthopedic surgery in sitting position performed under general&#xD;
      anesthesia and with interscalene block. The measure of hypotension will be expressed (in&#xD;
      mmHg) with the TWA-MAP value (time-weighted average intraoperative MAP) to define the&#xD;
      severity and duration of the hypotensive episode. For a subgroup of patients, brain oximetry&#xD;
      will be monitored using the ForeSight system to record episodes of cerebral desaturation.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include: number of severe hypotensive episodes (MAP &lt;60 mmHg or &lt;50 mmHg)&#xD;
      recorded; time to event: how long does it take for the medical staff to correct the&#xD;
      hypotensive episode (treated according to the planned protocol); quantity of vasopressors&#xD;
      and/or fluids used to correct the hypotensive event; incidence of perioperative adverse&#xD;
      cardiac events and acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that continuous non-invasive monitoring using ClearSight reduces&#xD;
      the incidence of intraoperative hypotensive events (defined by mean arterial pressure below a&#xD;
      value of 65 mmHg for more than 1 minute) and the duration of the events themselves, leading&#xD;
      to an improvement in patients' outcomes.&#xD;

      Intraoperative hypotension (MAP &lt;65 mmHg) in patients undergoing general anesthesia is a&#xD;
      notable risk factor for the development of post-operative complications including acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI), myocardial injury, stroke and delirium, and is strongly associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality. Moreover, the mean and systolic blood pressure values tend to undergo&#xD;
      significant fluctuations with different positions assumed by the patient during surgery,&#xD;
      decreasing in the transition from the supine position to the sitting position (beach chair&#xD;
      position) typically used during surgery that involves the anatomical district of the shoulder&#xD;
      or proximal humerus. Since severe hypotensive phenomena are connected with cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion and are associated with negative outcomes, close monitoring of blood pressure&#xD;
      is necessary. The investigators have introduced in clinical practice the use of non-invasive&#xD;
      ClearSight sensor (Edwards Lifesciences Corp, Irvine CA, USA), which uses the volume-clamp&#xD;
      and Physiocal technologies to obtain continuously calibrated blood pressure values and&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the number of&#xD;
      hypotensive episodes, their quality and their duration in patients monitored with the&#xD;
      oscillometric intermittent noninvasive blood pressure method compared to patients with&#xD;
      continuous noninvasive monitoring using ClearSight during orthopedic surgery in seated&#xD;
      position performed under general anesthesia and with interscalene block. The measure of&#xD;
      hypotension will be expressed with the TWA-MAP value (time-weighted average intraoperative&#xD;
      MAP) to define the severity and duration of the hypotensive episode. For a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients, brain oximetry will be monitored using the ForeSight system to record episodes of&#xD;
      cerebral desaturation. Secondary endpoints include: number of severe hypotensive episodes&#xD;
      (MAP &lt;60 mmHg or &lt;50 mmHg) recorded; time to event: how long does it take for the medical&#xD;
      staff to correct the hypotensive episode (treated according to the planned protocol);&#xD;
      quantity of vasopressors and/or fluids used to correct the hypotensive event; incidence of&#xD;
      perioperative adverse cardiac events and acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that continuous non-invasive monitoring using ClearSight reduces&#xD;
      the incidence of intraoperative hypotensive events (defined by mean arterial pressure below a&#xD;
      value of 65 mmHg for more than 1 minute) and the duration of the events themselves, leading&#xD;
      to an improvement in patients' outcomes.&#xD;
