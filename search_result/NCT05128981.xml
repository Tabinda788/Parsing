  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading cause s of health loss globally,&#xD;
      representing a large proportion of general disability. Anxiety and depression occur in 20-30&#xD;
      percent of patients following MI and have been identified as risk factors for recurrent&#xD;
      adverse cardiac event. The purpose of our this study is to develop and evaluate a disease&#xD;
      specific cognitive behavioral therapy (C BT) protocol to reduce cardia anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      increase physical inactivity and quality of life (Q oL) in patients following MI&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 30 patients. The MI-specific CBT lasts for 8 weeks and is therapist&#xD;
      guided and delivered via internet via a secure digital platform by licensed psychologists&#xD;
      expertise in CBT for cardiac disease or final year psychologist under supervision. During&#xD;
      treatment, the psychologists will have direct access to a cardiologist assigned to the&#xD;
      project and treatments are conducted in close interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure&#xD;
      patient safety&#xD;
