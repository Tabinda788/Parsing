  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaining Real-life Skills Over the Web (GROW) is an online parenting-skills intervention for&#xD;
      caregivers of children aged 0-4 who sustained traumatic brain injuries. GROW is designed to&#xD;
      promote family and child coping and adjustment for caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project develops and evaluates an online learning environment of web-based intervention&#xD;
      modules designed to promote family and child coping and adjustment (GROW: Gaining Real-life&#xD;
      Skills Over the Web) based on a comprehensive needs assessment of children aged 0 to 14 years&#xD;
      old, who experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI) between the ages of 0 to 4 years, and&#xD;
      their families. The incidence of TBI peaks between the ages 0 to 4 years, yet there are no&#xD;
      evidenced-based interventions to facilitate neurocognitive development and socio-emotional&#xD;
      functioning of children injured during this critical development period. To address the unmet&#xD;
      need of caregivers of infants and toddlers with TBI, the project uses a three-phase&#xD;
      development process to generate proof of concept and initial proof of product. Phase 1&#xD;
      involves a comprehensive needs assessment that includes quantitative assessment of family and&#xD;
      child needs, qualitative assessment through focus groups and interviews of families, feedback&#xD;
      from family and professional advisory boards, and consultation with professionals&#xD;
      implementing interventions with similar populations (e.g., families of children with very low&#xD;
      birth weight). During Phase 2, the project develops the content and manual for the&#xD;
      intervention modules, designs the online learning environment, and conducts intensive,&#xD;
      iterative usability testing. Phase 3 involves a pilot of the GROW program with 20 families to&#xD;
      evaluate its usability, acceptability, and qualitative and quantitative impact on stakeholder&#xD;
      identified outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Measuring caregiver psychological distress, the CES-D consists of 20 items that are rated on a 4-point likert scale (from 1: rarely or none of the time to 4: most or all of the time). Scores range from zero to sixty. Higher scores indicated a higher frequency of depressive symptoms during the last week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Stress Index Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention and Immediately Post-Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The study team used the 36 item short form PSI to measure caregiver stress. Using a 4-point likert scale, the stress scores range from 18 to 90, with lower scores indicating lower levels of parental stress.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention and Immediately Post-Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The study team used only the Sleep, Stress, and Anxiety Measures which are rated on a 5-point likert scale. Each measure has a range in score from 7 to 35 with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Burden of Injury Interview Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention and Immediately Post-Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The FBII measures family burden. Open-ended answers are coded Yes/No and are given a stress rating of 0 (not at all)-5(extremely stressful). Caregiver responses are averaged to provide an index of injury-related family burden.</description>

    <measure>MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention and Immediately Post-Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Using the short form MB-CDIs to measure child language abilities, the scoring scale is a minimum of 0- maximum of 310 with greater scores showing better language abilities.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver-Child Observation Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention and Immediately Post-Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Parent/Child Toy Play Ratings in the Play and Learning Strategies (PALS) manual, 6 domains (warmth, contingent responsiveness, demonstration/physical teaching, verbal stimulation/scaffolds, restrictions, and negativity/intrusiveness) are rated on scales of 1 to 5 with 1 being the worst rating and 5 being the best.</description>

    <measure>GROW Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-Intervention</time_frame>

    <description>The highly interactive GROW Program consists of 5 core modules and 1 optional, supplemental session. Each session is expected to take 15-20 minutes to complete, and at the end of each module, parents record a 5 minute &quot;special play time&quot; video interacting with their child to demonstrate the skills they learned in the session. Each online module is followed by a meeting with a trained therapist who will discuss their &quot;special play time&quot; video and the skills they are learning. Parents make their way through the 5 core modules sequentially before accessing the supplemental session that may be relevant to them.</description>
