      The first specific aim is to quantify improvement in ankle muscle function and functional&#xD;
      mobility following targeted ankle resistance gait training in ambulatory children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy (CP). The primary hypothesis for the first aim is that targeted ankle&#xD;
      resistance training will produce larger improvements in lower-extremity motor control, gait&#xD;
      mechanics, and clinical measures of mobility assessed four- and twelve-weeks post&#xD;
      intervention compared to standard physical therapy and standard gait training. The second&#xD;
      specific aim is to determine the efficacy of adaptive ankle assistance to improve capacity&#xD;
      and performance during sustained, high-intensity, and challenging tasks in ambulatory&#xD;
      children with CP. The primary hypothesis for the second aim is that adaptive ankle assistance&#xD;
      will result in significantly greater capacity and performance during the six-minute-walk-test&#xD;
      and graded treadmill and stair stepping protocols compared to walking with ankle foot&#xD;
      orthoses and walking with just shoes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A child's ability to walk effectively is essential to their physical health and general&#xD;
      well-being. Unfortunately, many children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most common cause of&#xD;
      pediatric physical disability, have difficulty walking and completing higher-intensity&#xD;
      ambulatory tasks. This leads to children with CP engaging in levels of habitual physical&#xD;
      activity that are well below guidelines and those of children without disabilities, which in&#xD;
      turn contributes to many secondary conditions, including metabolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. There is broad clinical consensus that plantarflexor dysfunction is a&#xD;
      primary contributor to slow, inefficient, and crouched walking patterns in CP; individuals&#xD;
      with CP need more effective treatments and mobility aids for plantarflexor dysfunction. To&#xD;
      meet this need, this proposal aims to evaluate a holistic strategy to address impaired&#xD;
      mobility from plantarflexor dysfunction in CP using a lightweight, dual-mode (assistive or&#xD;
      resistive) wearable robotic device. This strategy combines two complementary techniques: (1)&#xD;
      targeted ankle resistance for neuromuscular gait training that provides precision therapy to&#xD;
      elicit long-term improvements in ankle muscle function, and (2) adaptive ankle assistance to&#xD;
      make walking easier during sustained, high-intensity, or challenging tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Quantify improvement in ankle muscle function and functional mobility following&#xD;
      targeted ankle resistance gait training in ambulatory children with CP Approach - Repeated&#xD;
      Measures (RM) and randomized controlled trial: The investigators will compare functional&#xD;
      outcomes following targeted ankle resistance training (2 visits/week for 12 weeks) vs.&#xD;
      dose-matched standard physical therapy (RM) and vs. dose-matched standard treadmill training&#xD;
      (randomized controlled trial). Primary Hypothesis: Targeted ankle resistance training will&#xD;
      produce larger improvements in lower-extremity motor control, gait mechanics, and clinical&#xD;
      measures of mobility assessed four- and twelve-weeks post intervention compared to the&#xD;
      control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of adaptive ankle assistance to improve capacity and&#xD;
      performance during sustained, high-intensity, and challenging tasks in ambulatory children&#xD;
      with CP Approach - Repeated Measures: The investigators will compare task capacity and&#xD;
      performance with adaptive ankle assistance vs. standard ankle foot orthoses and vs. shod (no&#xD;
      ankle aid) during (a) 6-minute-walk-test, (b) extended-duration over-ground walking&#xD;
      (sustained), (c) graded treadmill (high-intensity), and (d) stair-stepping (challenging)&#xD;
      protocols. Task capacity and performance will be measured by duration, metabolic cost, speed,&#xD;
      and stride length, as applicable. Primary Hypothesis: Adaptive ankle assistance will result&#xD;
      in significantly greater capacity and performance compared to the control conditions.&#xD;
