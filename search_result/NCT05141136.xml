    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the spread of local anesthetic using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging after thoracic 2 paravertebral block in patients with cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy.&#xD;

      1. Ultrasound guided thoracic 2 paravertebral block will be done using sagittal scan or&#xD;
           transverse scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical parameters will be monitored (temperature, perfusion index, assessment of&#xD;
           sensory block and analgesic effect, vital sign, adverse events) after the nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cervical MRI will be taken 1 hour after the nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow up 7 days and 28 days after the MRI at outpatient clinic (numeric rating scale,&#xD;
           medication quantification scale)&#xD;

    <description>After the subject rests in the supine position for about 10 minutes, pulse oximetry is placed on the index finger to record the baseline value. Perfusion index was measured using pulse oximetry (Root®, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). The perfusion index can be a useful indicator for judging the After the subject rests in the supine position for about 10 minutes, pulse oximetry is placed on the index finger to record the baseline value.

Sensation is rated as 0 (no sensation), 1 (decreased sensation), and 2 (normal). A sensory block is considered successful if the patient reports 0 or 1. Cold sensation is measured in the same way using an ice cube. If there is no difference in the sensation of the treated dermatome compared to the contralateral dermatome.</description>

    <description>Place the ultrasound probe vertically against the patient's spine and insert the needle in-plane. The width of insertion of the needle is usually approximately 5 cm from the midline. After the needle penetrates the superior costovertebral ligament and pops, when it reaches the thoracic paravertebral space, perform aspiration and inject 10 mL of 1% lidocaine. At this time, it can be observed in real time as the infusion fluid pushes the bright pleura away from the needle.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ultrasound probe transverse group</intervention_name>
    <description>Place the ultrasound probe transverse to the spine and insert the needle in-plane. The reflection of a transverse process is a common landmark. The needle goes in from lateral to in plane. The goal is a triangle between the parietal pleura anteriorly and the internal intercostal membrane and intercostal muscle posteriorly. The final point of the needle is the transition zone from the intercostal to the thoracic paraspinal space, just anterior to the transverse process. When it is confirmed that the tip of the needle has reached the paravertebral space, 10 mL of 1% lidocaine is injected after checking the negative pressure, and after confirming the spread of the drug in real time with ultrasound.</description>
