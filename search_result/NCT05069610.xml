  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AD17002 has demonstrated superior safety and efficacy as a nasal adjuvant function to an&#xD;
      influenza vaccine in two completed clinical studies, and has innate immune modulatory and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties which could potentially be an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 2a, multi-center study is set up to assess the safety, tolerability, and potential&#xD;
      efficacy of AD17002 in participants with mild COVID-19. The Immunogenicity of repeated doses&#xD;
      of AD17002 will also be explored.&#xD;

      Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be isolated and confined to the study site to&#xD;
      receive treatment for COVID-19. Eligible participants will be assigned to 2 cohorts, Cohort 1&#xD;
      and Cohort 2, in a sequential manner to undergo either a 3-dose (Cohort 1) or 5-dose (Cohort&#xD;
      2) treatment regimen. Within each cohort, participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive standard of care treatment and add-on therapy of AD17002 at 20 μg or placebo.&#xD;
      Randomized participants will be assigned a participant number. The participants, site&#xD;
      personnel and the Sponsor will be blinded to the treatment assignment. Randomization will not&#xD;
      be stratified and participants who withdraw from the study after starting treatment will not&#xD;
      be replaced, except for participants who undergo sentinel dosing in Cohort 2.&#xD;

             clinically apparent hepatic impairment (e.g., jaundice, cholestasis, hepatic synthetic&#xD;
             impairment, active hepatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
