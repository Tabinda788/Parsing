  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purulent Oedematous Sinusitis (POS) is a particular form of chronic rhinosinusitis observed&#xD;
      in 2% of the general population. In spite of its heavy impact on the quality of life, There&#xD;
      is no established recommendation for the treatment of primary POS. Long-term low-dose&#xD;
      macrolides are currently proposed for these forms of chronic rhinosinusitis when conventional&#xD;
      treatments (local corticosteroids, saline rinsing, iterative short courses of antibiotics&#xD;
      targeted on pathogens, and surgical opening and drainage) have failed. This treatment with&#xD;
      macrolides is currently applied off-label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of macrolides in POS. An extensive workup is fulfilled&#xD;
      to exclude other forms of chronic rhinosinusitis (Th2 biased inflammatory diseases, allergic&#xD;
      diseases) (allergy, nasosinusal polyposis) or those due to cystic fibrosis or immune&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      POS is a particular form of chronic rhinosinusitis described in 2% of the general population.&#xD;
      They lead to an alteration in the quality of daily life with a significant impact on the&#xD;
      professional life of 70% of patients. They can be of idiopathic or of secondary origin. The&#xD;
      most frequent secondary forms are those observed in cystic fibrosis and immune deficiencies.&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of primary POS remains poorly understood, involving Th1-type inflammation&#xD;
      and various bacteria (with Staphylococcus Aureus in the forefront). Bacteria could impair the&#xD;
      ciliary beat, perpetuating infection and mucosal inflammation. There is no established&#xD;
      recommendation for the treatment of primary POS Long-term low-dose macrolides are currently&#xD;
      proposed for these forms of chronic rhinosinusitis when conventional treatments (local&#xD;
      corticosteroids, saline rinsing, iterative short courses of antibiotics adapted to the germs&#xD;
      found, and surgical drainage) have failed. This treatment with macrolides is currently used&#xD;
      off label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macrolides are effective on most gram-positive and gram-positive bacteria. Macrolides also&#xD;
      have immunomodulatory properties on the Th1 immune response. This effect is maintained even&#xD;
      in the presence of macrolide-resistant bacteria. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
      daily administration of half-dose macrolides over the long term (HDLT) has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing the frequency of infectious exacerbations. Uncontrolled trials have&#xD;
      described an improvement in symptom scores in chronic rhinosinusitis with or without polyps.&#xD;
      The results observed in randomized trials versus placebo are contradictory. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      published in 2013 based on these 2 randomized studies was inconclusive regarding the efficacy&#xD;
      of HDLT macrolides. The heterogeneity of the inclusion criteria with rhinosinusitis of a&#xD;
      different proTh-2 inflammatory profile corresponding to that usually observed in nasal&#xD;
      polyposis could explain this lack of result. A review of the literature published in 2017 on&#xD;
      HDLT macrolides based on 52 publications observed a very wide diversity of antibiotic&#xD;
      protocols in terms of the molecule chosen, the administration scheme and the duration of&#xD;
      treatment (8 to 24 weeks). The number of patients studied was often small, which affected the&#xD;
      statistical power of the results obtained. The authors of this review conclude by stressing&#xD;
      the need to conduct placebo-controlled studies on large populations of patients selected on&#xD;
      the phenotypic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study propose to evaluate the value of HDLT macrolides in this specific etiological&#xD;
      setting. This project plans to exclude all chronic rhinosinusitis of Th2 inflammatory origin&#xD;
      (allergy, nasosinusal polyposis) or those due to cystic fibrosis or immune deficiency. In&#xD;
      addition, the inclusion centers selected in Ile de France have the necessary expertise to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of azithromycin on mucociliary clearance, notably with the development of&#xD;
      innovative tools to measure the efficiency of the ciliary beat (high-speed video microscopy&#xD;
      and particle tracking).At the same time, the tolerance of HDLT macrolides measured in&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is excellent,&#xD;
      provided that the well-documented contraindications are respected. No serious adverse effects&#xD;
      have been reported, apart from cases of transient or permanent moderate hearing loss&#xD;
      requiring audiometric monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific study regarding the treatment of primary POS is available to date, even tough POS&#xD;
      is very prevalent and its management is still associated with poor patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
