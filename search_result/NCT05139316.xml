      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of DTX401 to reduce or&#xD;
      eliminate dependence on exogenous glucose replacement therapy to maintain euglycemia and to&#xD;
      maintain or improve the quality of glucose control.&#xD;

      Study DTX401-CL301 is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and confirm the safety of DTX401 in patients 8 years and older with&#xD;
      glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa). Participants will be randomized 1:1 to DTX401 or&#xD;
      placebo group, and followed closely for 48 weeks. At week 48 eligible participants will cross&#xD;
      over and receive DTX401 if they had previously received placebo or placebo if they had&#xD;
      previously received DTX401, and will be followed closely for an additional 48 weeks. After&#xD;
      completion of week 96 or early withdrawal, participants will be offered enrollment into a&#xD;
      Disease Monitoring Program (DMP) where they will be followed for at least 10 years post&#xD;
      DTX401 infusion.&#xD;
