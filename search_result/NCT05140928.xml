  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to assess the effect of giving dadiah as a supplement to pregnant&#xD;
      women on improving the growth and digestive health of children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out on pregnant women in four Public Health Center (PHC) areas in&#xD;
      Padang Panjang, West Sumatra, Indonesia. They were screened for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Once eligibility was confirmed, pregnant women were randomly allocated to&#xD;
      intervention or control groups. The details of the study protocol were explained, and&#xD;
      voluntary written consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General information about the mother was collected and a general physical examination was&#xD;
      assessed. The intervention started at about 10-20 weeks of gestation and continued until just&#xD;
      before the time of delivery. Subjects took the study supplements concurrently with the&#xD;
      government's dietary supplementation program. In each home visit, the remaining supplements&#xD;
      from the previous visit were counted and documented in the pudding checklist form. Details of&#xD;
      symptoms or illnesses during consumption of dadiah pudding will be reported either by&#xD;
      participants directly contacting field officers, study staff, or during weekly visits and&#xD;
      will be recorded and documented in the case report form. In the third trimester, subjects&#xD;
      received healthy food, breastfeeding practices, and child development education to support&#xD;
      mothers in maintaining their nutritional status, preparing exclusive breastfeeding, and&#xD;
      optimizing child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy babies born to mothers will be the focus of this study and followed up until the age&#xD;
      of three months to assess their growth. The information includes the baby's health history&#xD;
      after birth, anthropometric measurements, nutritional intake, and breastfeeding practices&#xD;
      which are measured repeatedly in the first, second, and third months. The collection of&#xD;
      breast milk and baby feces is carried out in the first week and third month after the baby is&#xD;
      born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated taking into account all outcome variables including the&#xD;
      proportion of gut microbiota, levels of IgA secretion in breast milk and infant feces, and&#xD;
      child growth, with the independent variable being maternal supplementation during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality assurance is carried out through training starting from the period of data&#xD;
      collection and supervision during and after data collection, including the data analysis&#xD;
      process. This included training for enumerators, subjects and using a validated questionnaire&#xD;
      for a group of subjects representing similar characteristics for this study. Data input and&#xD;
      cleaning process will use excel and SPSS while for food intake data using NutriSurvey 2007.&#xD;
      Data entry will be carried out by data collection officers after data collection. The data&#xD;
      cleaning process includes removing outliers and regrouping multiple results that have similar&#xD;
      meanings. The data will be interpreted as mean ± standard deviation if the data is normally&#xD;
      distributed and the median (min-max) if the data is not normally distributed. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis using SPSS 20 and data will be analyzed using univariate and bivariate analysis.&#xD;
      Univariate analysis is used to describe characteristics and socio-demographics, medical&#xD;
      history, pregnancy, and obstetric profiles of pregnant women. Numerical variables between&#xD;
      groups will be analyzed using an Independent sample t-test if the data has normal&#xD;
      distribution or the Mann Whitney test if the data distribution is not normal. Categorical&#xD;
      variables between groups will be analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher test. Differences&#xD;
      between birth and 3 months old follow up will be analyzed using Dependent t-tests if the data&#xD;
      distribution has normal distribution or Wilcoxon test if the data distribution is not normal.&#xD;
