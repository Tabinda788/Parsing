    <measure>Child and Youth Psychological Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The short formula of the scale consisting of 12 items was made by Ungar, Liebenberg, and LeBlanc (2013) (Liebenberg et al., 2013). The popular heights of children and young youth are seen as .39 and .84 from the inside. According to the five-point Likert scale in the scale, it is answered as &quot;Describes me (5)&quot; and &quot;Does not describe me at all (1)&quot;. A high score indicates high robustness. The Turkish adaptation of the scale and its reliability-validity study were performed by Arslan (2015). A minimum of 12 points and a maximum of 60 points can be obtained from the scale. High score values indicate a high level of resilience.The factor loads of twelve items of the Child and Adolescent Resilience Scale ranged from .54 to .81. This situation is important in terms of showing the high level of representativeness power of the items in the scale.</description>
