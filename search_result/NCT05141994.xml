    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open, and phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of BAT5906 injection in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration. The&#xD;
      results of the BAT5906 Phase I study show that it is safe from 0.3-4.0 mg, and that higher&#xD;
      doses (2.5 mg and 4 mg) may be substituted for the duration of maintenance efficacy; drugs&#xD;
      with the same target (such as brolucizumab and Abecip) have also been found in clinical&#xD;
      studies High doses can extend the interval and reduce the frequency of administration.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, two doses with better safety and efficacy were selected, once every&#xD;
      4 weeks, followed by 3 consecutive injections for treatment as needed, and preliminary&#xD;
      exploration of the best clinical effective dose and replacement frequency&#xD;
