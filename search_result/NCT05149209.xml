  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This study will be conducted to evaluate and compare the clinical performance of&#xD;
           fluoride, calcium, and phosphate-releasing new bioactive material versus a&#xD;
           fluoride-releasing hybrid restorative material in cervical lesions for one-year&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical evaluation will be done using modified USPHS criteria at baseline,3,6,9 and&#xD;
           12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      two groups of 30 patients will receive cervical restorations by using calcium and phosphate&#xD;
      releasing hybrid restorative material (Activa™ Presto, Pulpdent®, USA), or a&#xD;
      fluoride-releasing hybrid restorative material (Giomer, Shofu, Japan). Then these&#xD;
      restorations will be evaluated at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months&#xD;
      according to modified USPHS criteria in terms of marginal adaptation, Marginal discoloration,&#xD;
      recurrent caries, retention, surface texture, and Post-operative sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination and selection of all patients will be done according to inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A class v cavity will be prepared after local anesthesia has been given as required.&#xD;
           Rubber dam isolation followed by the placement of restorative material according to the&#xD;
           randomization sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the intervention: selective etching to enamel and universal bond agent to all the&#xD;
           cavity will be applied first, followed by filling of the cavity with fluoride, calcium,&#xD;
           and phosphate-releasing new bioactive material (Activa™ Presto, Pulpdent®, USA) using a&#xD;
           19-gauge applicator tip on the syringe and light-curing for 20 seconds between each 2mm&#xD;
           layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the control group: selective etching to enamel and universal bond agent to all the&#xD;
           cavity will be applied first, followed by filling of the cavity with fluoride-releasing&#xD;
           hybrid restorative material (Giomer, Shofu, Japan) and will be light polymerized using a&#xD;
           light-emitting diode (LED) light-curing unit for 10 seconds between each 2mm layer.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The participants will be blinded to the technique used since the patient will attend the same number of visits and he can not differentiate between different restorative materials.&#xD;
The operator cannot be blinded because of the difference in the application procedures of each restorative material.&#xD;
The outcome assessor will be blinded to the material used. This will be performed by M.S. and Y.H. Therefore the assessors mustn't be included in the preclinical assessment.</masking_description>
