  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT aims to investigate the effectiveness of the early use of Kinesio-taping (KT)&#xD;
      together with standard physiotherapy treatment, in the prevention of the shoulder pain of the&#xD;
      hemiplegic upper limb following a cerebral stroke compared to conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      without KT treatment. As a secondary outcome, this RCT aims to investigate if KT could&#xD;
      improve functional recovery and delay the onset of spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists in two parallel groups of 15 participants each. The treatment and&#xD;
      observation period will last 1 month.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following RCT single blind study will be performed in the Rehabilitative Operative Unit 4&#xD;
      of the I.R.C.C.S. Fondazione Santa Lucia in Rome, Italy. It aims to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the early use of Kinesio-taping (KT) together with standard physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment, in the prevention of shoulder pain of the hemiplegic upper limb following a&#xD;
      cerebral stroke, in the subacute phase. As a secondary outcome, a potential impact on&#xD;
      functional recovery and on the onset of spasticity affecting the muscles of the upper limb&#xD;
      will be evaluated. The early application of KT aims to prevent subluxation of the hemiplegic&#xD;
      shoulder and therefore pain secondary to the prolonged mechanical stress of the&#xD;
      capsulo-ligamentous and tendon structures, due to the weight of the limb in the antigravity&#xD;
      position. A total of 30 patients will be enrolled by the investigators and randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). The EG, as part of the&#xD;
      standard treatment, will be subject to a total of 4 applications of KT, each of which to be&#xD;
      kept for 5 days a week followed by 2 days of rest, to safeguard skin integrity before a&#xD;
      further application. The participants will be evaluated for eligibility at the admission&#xD;
      after discharge from the Stroke Units of the local district area. The KT application will be&#xD;
      carried out at an early stage, immediately after enrollment and possibly before the painful&#xD;
      symptoms and subluxation are overt. The CG will undergo a KT application on the deltoid&#xD;
      without support function, with the same frequency and duration as the EG (sham-application).&#xD;
      The outcomes that will be evaluated are: the intensity of perceived pain (Ritchie Articular&#xD;
      Index - RAI), the functionality of the upper limb (Fugl-Meyer Assessment - FMA-UE) and the&#xD;
      presence of hypertonus in the muscles of the upper limb (modified Ashwort scale - MAS). The&#xD;
      treatment lasted 4 weeks and the timing of data collection was organized as follows: T (0) -&#xD;
      the initial assessment immediately after enrollment; T (1) - the intermediate evaluation&#xD;
      performed before the fifth rehabilitation treatment; T (2) - the final evaluation performed&#xD;
      at the end of the 8 treatments. Follow-up after discharge cannot currently be predicted due&#xD;
      to hospital access restrictions due to the COVID pandemic.&#xD;

    <description>The Ritchie Articular Index (RAI) is an 4 point index for the numerical measurement of joint tenderness. It grades 0: no tenderness, 1: patient complained of pain, 2: patient complained of pain and winced, 3: patient complained of pain and winced and withdrew. 0 is the better outcome, 3 is the worse outcome. The shoulder joint pain will be assessed</description>

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) evaluates aspects of movement, reflex, coordination, and speed of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. Each of 33 FMA-UE items scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially, 2=performs fully), so the total score ranges from a minimum of 0 (worse outcome) to a maximum of 66 points (better outcome)</description>

    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) is a 6-points ordinal scale used to assess muscle spasticity, measuring resistance during muscle passive stretching. It grades from 0 to 5: 0 means no increase in muscle tone (better outcome) and 5 means rigid (worse outcome)</description>

    <description>Conventional rehabilitative treatment (consisting in two treatments per day of 40 minutes each) plus a bi-weekly treatment focused on the joint complex of the shoulder plus Kinesio-taping (KT) treatment.&#xD;
The Kinesio-taping treatment consists in 4 applications of KT on the affected shoulder to be held for 5 days a week, followed by 2 days of rest to safeguard skin integrity before a further application.&#xD;
5 KT strips with graded tensions will be placed on the following muscles:&#xD;
supraspinatus with a tension of 70%.&#xD;
infraspinatus with a tension of 70%. 3,4,5) deltoid (3 strips, 50% of tension) A sixth application with a tension of 90% originates at the level of the anterior face of the humeral head and it ends to the lower corner of the scapula.</description>
