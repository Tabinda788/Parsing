      This is an interventional therapy study designed to evaluate the efficacy of a two-week&#xD;
      intervention, i.e. training with a specialized exhalation training device (called expiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength training; EMST150 or EMST75; Aspire Products, Gainsville, FL) on swallowing&#xD;
      function in patients with neurodegenerative Parkinsonian disorders. This study involves a&#xD;
      routine endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) to diagnose dysphagia before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. Between the two FEES, a two-week exhalation training program takes place, which&#xD;
      the patients perform independently following instructions from a speech and lanuage&#xD;
      pathologist. In addition demographic and disease-specific data and two questionnaires&#xD;
      (Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire for Parkinson's disease patients, SDQ-PD, and&#xD;
      Swallowing specific Quality Of Life Questionnaire SWAL-QoL) are recorded.&#xD;

      This is an interventional therapy study designed to evaluate the efficacy of a two-week&#xD;
      intervention, i.e. training with a specialized exhalation training device (called expiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength training; EMST150 or EMST75; Aspire Products, Gainsville, FL) on swallowing&#xD;
      function in patients with neurodegenerative Parkinsonian disorders. This study involves a&#xD;
      routine endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) to diagnose dysphagia before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. Between the two FEES, a two-week exhalation training program takes place, which&#xD;

      (Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire for Parkinson's disease patients, SDQ-PD, and&#xD;
      Swallowing specific Quality Of Life Questionnaire SWAL-QoL) are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis: Two weeks of EMST will lead to a significant improvement of the endoscopic&#xD;
      dysphagia score in patients with neurodegenerative Parkinsonian disorders with endoscopically&#xD;
      proven oropharyngeal dysphagia. Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome as well as its&#xD;
      differential diagnoses, multiple system atrophy (MSA) and diseases from the group of 4repeat&#xD;
      tauopathies, will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD):&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 80% of all patients with PD develop clinically relevant dysphagia during the course&#xD;
      of the disease. This can lead to a significant reduction in quality of life, decreased&#xD;
      medication efficacy, malnutrition, dehydration, and ultimately aspiration pneumonia in&#xD;
      affected patients, which is the most common cause of death in advanced PD patients. The cause&#xD;
      of PD-associated dysphagia is a multifactorial genesis with impairment of dopaminergic and&#xD;
      non-dopaminergic pathways of the central swallowing network and additional peripheral&#xD;
      neuromuscular influences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple System Atrophy (MSA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSA is clinically associated with autonomic dysregulation manifested by neurogenic urinary&#xD;
      bladder emptying dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, sleep-related respiratory&#xD;
      dysregulation, etc. in addition to Parkinsonian and/or cerebellar symptoms. Median survival&#xD;
      after diagnosis is approximately 7 years. At disease onset, differentiation from idiopathic&#xD;
      PD is difficult. However, relatively early in the course of the disease, symptoms such as a&#xD;
      brittle voice or stridor may appear during normal breathing, which may be clues to the&#xD;
      diagnosis of MSA. Since laryngeal abnormalities are associated with a significantly reduced&#xD;
      life expectancy, they require special attention and diagnosis. In this regard, we have&#xD;
      recently shown that a high prevalence of laryngeal movement abnormalities is present in MSA&#xD;
      patients and can even be used to differentiate them from idiopathic Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      Swallowing function, the regulation of which is associated with autonomic centers of&#xD;
      laryngeal function, is also often impaired early in patients with MSA. Because dysphagia can&#xD;
      further limit quality of life and life expectancy, this symptom also requires early diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. We could recently show that the dysphagia pattern also differs between PD and&#xD;
      MSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4repeat tauopathies (4RT): The form of 4RT, also named progressive supranuclear gaze palsy&#xD;
      (PSP) with all clinical subtypes, is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that&#xD;
      leads to progressive functional impairment of cortical and subcortical function in affected&#xD;
      individuals due to accumulation of tau protein in the brain. Due to the clinical variability&#xD;
      of presentation, early diagnostic certainty is desirable, especially since human IgG4-&#xD;
      antibodies directed against extracellular tau protein are currently in clinical trials to&#xD;
      modify the course of the disease (see NCT03068468, NCT02985879). 4RT are also associated with&#xD;
      swallowing and speech problems, and aspiration pneumonia is among the leading causes of death&#xD;
      in this disease group. In addition, characteristic abnormalities may also occur due to&#xD;
      dystonic dysinnervation of laryngeal muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dysphagia in atypical Parkinsonian syndromes, there are no proven interventional or drug&#xD;
      therapy options. Previous studies in patients with PD had shown efficacy of a four-week&#xD;
      training with a special expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) device. Both swallowing&#xD;
      reliability and swallowing efficiency were improved. Studies on the efficacy of EMST on&#xD;
      dysphagia of atypical Parkinsonian syndromes do not yet exist. Having demonstrated the&#xD;
      efficacy of EMST in a 4-week intervention regime, the first aim is to test whether a&#xD;
      shortened intervention duration of two weeks is also effective in patient with PD. In&#xD;
      addition, this protocol will be performed in patients with MSA and 4RT to investigate&#xD;
      effects, particularly on swallowing safety (reduction of penetration/aspiration events) and&#xD;
      swallowing efficiency (reduction of pharyngeal residuals). Currently, all patients with PD,&#xD;
      MSA, or 4RT at participating study sites receive a speech and language pathology examination&#xD;
      and endoscopic diagnostics according to a defined protocol. In addition to phoniatric and&#xD;
      swallowing-specific examinations, an endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is routinely&#xD;
      performed. Regarding the efficacy of EMST training on pharyngeal dysphagia in patients with&#xD;
      PD, two randomized, placebo-controlled studies from recent years with n=60 and n=50 patients,&#xD;
      respectively, have already shown an efficacy of training on both swallowing reliability and&#xD;
      swallowing efficiency in PD patients. Relevant side effects or risks from training for the&#xD;
      patients were not reported in the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using an EMST device have been conducted in recent years not only in patients with&#xD;
      IPS, but also in patients with dysphagia due to other primary pathologies (e.g., amyotrophic&#xD;
      lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, etc.). In summary, a positive effect was&#xD;
      shown, particularly on laryngeal muscle strengthening, which was reflected in an improvement&#xD;
      in dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The affected patients receive an initial endoscopic evaluation of the swallowing act in the&#xD;
      clinical setting as part of routine diagnostics. In addition, oral and written patient&#xD;
      education is provided. After written consent on the informed consent form, the following data&#xD;
      are then collected anonymously prior to the start of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. sociographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. disease milestones&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MDS-UPDRS I-IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. UMSARS / PSP-RS&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. SDQ-PD&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. SWAL-QOL&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Hoehn and Yahr stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Current drug therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. MSA-FEES examination protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Pulmonary function test&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is followed by the individual adjustment of the EMST device for the respective patient.&#xD;
      For this purpose, the maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) is first determined for the&#xD;
      respective patient in the pulmonary function examination using a pressure manometer. 75% of&#xD;
      the MEP is set for the subsequent training on the EMST device. This is then followed by the&#xD;
      actual intervention. For this, the patient receives logopedic instruction on the correct use&#xD;
      of the EMST device. The intervention regime then consists of 5x5 breaths per day for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days. Immediately following, items 3-10 will be collected again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The collection of data regarding the effectiveness of EMST in a shortened protocol (two&#xD;
           weeks) on swallowing function in patients with PD can help to integrate this form of&#xD;
           therapy firmly in the therapy regime of speech and language therapy also in the context&#xD;
           of inpatient stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The evaluation of the efficacy of EMST in atypical Parkinsonian syndromes is the first&#xD;
           interventional study with the attempt to improve dysphagia in these disease spectra. If&#xD;
           this study demonstrates improvement in dysphagia in MSA and 4RT, appropriate patients&#xD;
           would be offered a specific EMST in the future, which may then delay or prevent the&#xD;
           development of higher-grade dysphagia. Since consecutive aspiration pneumonia on the&#xD;
           floor of neurogenic dysphagia is the leading cause of death in these patients, this&#xD;
           could at least delay serious medical complications in the future, improve quality of&#xD;
           life, and prolong survival. In addition, new evidence would be gained for the use of&#xD;
           activating therapies in the treatment of Parkinson's-associated dysphagia.&#xD;
