  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized controlled trial. It included young girls with primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea in a district located in the south of Turkey and was conducted between March 01,&#xD;
      2021 and June 30, 2021. The sample size of this research was decided by performing a power&#xD;
      analysis in the power statistical program. Considering the parameters of the groups, the&#xD;
      effect size was calculated to be 0.5003604. Since α was found to be 0.05 and power (1 - β)&#xD;
      was 0.95, a total number of 66 participants were distributed into three equal groups (sage&#xD;
      oil massage: 22, Reiki: 22, control: 22). Considering the possibility of case losses, 30&#xD;
      participants were included in each group; finally, a total of 90 people were included in the&#xD;
      study. For data collection, a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics and&#xD;
      the visual analog scale (VAS) were used. Reiki and massage with sage oil were applied for 30&#xD;
      minutes, and no application was performed on the control group.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The researchers massaged the abdomen with sage oil for 30 minutes, and 30 minutes after the massage, VAS evaluation and blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse rate measurements were performed again.&#xD;
VAS pain scores were also evaluated in the Reiki group (30 participants) when the pain started. The participants experienced pain on the first 3 days of their menstruation. Their blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse rate were also measured. Reiki was applied by a researcher with a Reiki certificate. Thirty minutes after the Reiki application, VAS evaluation and blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse rate measurements were repeated. This application was repeated for two menstrual periods.&#xD;
Similarly, in the control group (30 participants), VAS pain scores were evaluated when the pain started on the first three days of their menstruation, and their blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse rate were measured. No application was performed; they were only asked to rest.</masking_description>

    <intervention_name>Sage oil group</intervention_name>
    <description>Sometimes called muscatel. Made by steam or water distillation of Salvia sclarea flowering tops and foliage. Yields range from 0.7 to 1.5%. A pale yellow to yellow liquid with a herbaceous odor and a winelike bouquet. Produced in large quantities in France, Russia and Morocco.

    <description>Within complementary and integrative health practices, Reiki is an ancient practice of Japanese origin widely used worldwide. Through the touch or approximation of the hands, an enabled therapist applies this technique to eliminate toxins, to balance the organism, and to favor the full functioning of the organism, to reestablish the flow of vital energy. Reiki as bioenergy therapy works with the energy that leads the human body to a calmer state that is linked to health and cure. Reiki therapists conduct the curing energy that enters the top of the head and leaves through the hands.</description>
