  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From March 2021, COVID-19 vaccines have been made available to Hong Kong residents, first to&#xD;
      priority groups including healthcare professionals and the elderly, and later to all adults&#xD;
      and adolescents. Vaccinated individuals are generally exempted from mandatory regular&#xD;
      out-of-pocket antigen testing. Vaccinated individuals of university halls and colleges of The&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong (HKU) will also be exempted from mandatory weekly antigen testing.&#xD;
      Freedom of choice is highly respected in the HKU community and as such, we would like to&#xD;
      better understand the decision-making process among members of the HKU community. The&#xD;
      anonymised results of this independent research study will help us understand preferences&#xD;
      among the HKU community and inform on future vaccination planning policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To elicit HKU staff and students' preferences and their willingness-to-pay (WTP)&#xD;
      for COVID-19 vaccination in Hong Kong&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: An online cross-sectional internet-based questionnaire with a discrete choice&#xD;
      experiment (DCE) design distributed via email. All current students and staff from the&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong are eligible to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: Preferences for the efficacy of protecting against infection, against&#xD;
      severe disease manifestations, duration of protection, risk of adverse events, incentives,&#xD;
      and out-of-pocket costs&#xD;
