      Data collection and assessment on patients with left-sided breast cancer or undergoing lung&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) utilizing continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) devices.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a definitive treatment for&#xD;
      patients with early-stage lung cancers as well as for patients with limited metastases to the&#xD;
      lung. One challenge with the treatment of the lung is the risk of pulmonary toxicity,&#xD;
      particularly for early-stage lungs cancers that are inoperable (those receiving primary lung&#xD;
      SBRT) or those with metastatic cancers receiving systemic therapy that may impact pulmonary&#xD;
      function (those receiving lung SBRT for metastatic cancers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices are commonly utilized for patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea. However, through the use of continuous pressure, lung volumes are&#xD;
      increased. Preliminary data in patients undergoing breast radiation as well as lung radiation&#xD;
      has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of such an approach, demonstrating increased lung&#xD;
      volumes with decreases in heart dose6-8. Additional potential advantages of CPAP include&#xD;
      increased ease of use for patients and the potential for cost savings as compared to&#xD;
      traditional respiratory management techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study is to allow for the collection and assessment of data on patients with&#xD;
      left-sided breast cancer or undergoing lung SBRT utilizing CPAP. This will allow for the&#xD;
      assessment of lung doses with and without CPAP as well as cardiac doses. No additional&#xD;
      changes to our standard of care breast or lung radiation will occur. With respect to the&#xD;
      safety profile, CPAP is commonly used with limited toxicity concerns. The potential benefit&#xD;
      of CPAP has reduced lung and heart doses and, consequently, radiation-related toxicities.&#xD;

    <description>Simulation scans will be performed with CPAP and free breathing. The breast/chest wall, and tumors (lung SBRT), as well as lung and heart, will be contoured on each scan. Using the CPAP scan as a reference, we will assess breast/chest wall motion, lung tumor motion, and organ at risk (ex. heart, abdominal organs) motion with free-breathing scans for each patient and analyze by treatment site (breast vs. lung SBRT).</description>
