      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of BLU-701&#xD;
      as monotherapy or in combination with either osimertinib or platinum-based chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with EGFRm NSCLC.&#xD;

      The study will include an initial Phase 1 portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BLU-701 as monotherapy (Part 1A; initially in&#xD;
      a once daily (QD) regimen with the option to evaluate twice daily (BID) dosing if supported&#xD;
      by emerging PK and safety data), as well as additional dose-escalation portions to determine&#xD;
      the RP2D of BLU-701 in combination with osimertinib (Part 1B) or in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin and pemetrexed (Part 1C), and a Phase 2 expansion group to further evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of BLU-701 as monotherapy (Part 2A).&#xD;
