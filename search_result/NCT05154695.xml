  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have different response to different treatment modalities, and sore/pain medicine is&#xD;
      no exception. In our experience, low-level laser (LLL), ultrasound, and prolotherapy can&#xD;
      reduce sore /pain through different genetic pathway. Whether the therapeutic effect is&#xD;
      controlled by the genetic variants of those sore /pain related genes or not, is still in&#xD;
      debate. The aims of this study are (1) To find genetic SNPs which can determine the response&#xD;
      of sore /pain treatment modalities. (2) To find possible metabolomics and proteomic markers&#xD;
      of sore /pain. (3) To determine the algorithm of precision medicine for sore /pain control&#xD;
      via the genetic markers. Investigators will recruit 80 myofascial pain patients from&#xD;
      Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Taiwan University Hospital&#xD;
      Bei-Hu Branch in 2021 and 2022. The participants will receive LLL, ultrasound, and&#xD;
      prolotherapy, and the therapeutic effect will be recorded. The blood and urine samples from&#xD;
      the first, the second, and the third visits will be analyzed by next generation sequencing,&#xD;
      and mass spectrometry to find the possible biomarker in 2023 and 2024. Investigators expect&#xD;
      to develop the individualized treatment plan by means of these biomarkers. Hopefully, the&#xD;
      results will be widely applied in the field of sore /pain medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is defined as &quot;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or&#xD;
      potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage&quot; by the International&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). The musculoskeletal disorders are not only the most&#xD;
      common cause of chronic sore/pain, but they also result in significant disability in about&#xD;
      50% of sufferers in the US. Furthermore, since these disorders are the most common cause of&#xD;
      severe, long-term pain and disability in the elderly over 65 years. In the practice of pain&#xD;
      medicine, the doctors predominantly use multi-modal treatment, including medications,&#xD;
      physical agents, and injection, to relieve patients' discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past years, our team had some achievements to justify the search of genetic variants&#xD;
      for development of a new sore/pain treatment algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Analgesia of LLLT is through TRPV1. (2) Analgesia by therapeutic ultrasound is through&#xD;
      ASIC3. (3) Dextrose injection decreased chronic muscle pain through ASIC1a. (4) Biomarker for&#xD;
      sore/pain in fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the clinical outcome, some patients responded to physical agents well, and some&#xD;
      preferred injections. The genetic variants of the above-mentioned genes might be the&#xD;
      determining factors of differential therapeutic effects. However, it took about 4-8 weeks for&#xD;
      a patient to switch from one treatment option to another one. If investigators can determine&#xD;
      the optimal treatment modality by genetic biomarkers, the treatment course and total expanse&#xD;
      will decrease a lot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the genetic variants of the proposed genes (TRPV1, ASIC1a,&#xD;
      ASIC3, Tac1, COMT, TCL1A, POMC, RGS4, ASIC2, ASIC4, TRPA1, NK1R, G2A, GPR4, OGR1, TDAG8,&#xD;
      TASK1, TASK2, TASK3, TREK1, P2X2, P2X3, P2X5, TRPV4) could be the prognostic biomarkers of&#xD;
      sore /pain treatments. Our specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To set up next generation sequencing (NGS)-based approach to find genetic variants which&#xD;
           can determine the response of sore/pain treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find possible metabolomics and proteomic markers of sore/pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the algorithm of precision medicine for sore/pain control via the genetic&#xD;
           markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six. study design I Patient eligibility Investigators will recruit patients from National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital Bei-Hu Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: (1) Age between 20-100 years old. (2) Diagnosed as myofascial pain&#xD;
      syndrome patients and willing to receive treatment (including LLLT, therapeutic ultrasound,&#xD;
      and local dextrose injection therapy). The diagnosis of MPS was confirmed by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator using the criteria of taut band, trigger point, and radiating pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Those having active infection, malignancy, and hematological diseases&#xD;
      were excluded. The patients had received local injection at upper trapezius within 3 months&#xD;
      are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II Study design and flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After obtaining the informed consent, the basic demographic data, including age, gender,&#xD;
           job, education level, and past medical history of eligible patients are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The eligible patients first received LLLT with a 685-nm wavelength and an output of 30&#xD;
           mW at energy densities of 8 J/cm2 at trigger point of upper trapezius muscle. The pre-&#xD;
           and post-treatment VAS-pain and VAS-sng are collected for LLLT phenotype determination,&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Then, they are randomly assigned into two groups (40 subjects in each group): A.&#xD;
           therapeutic ultrasound group; B. prolotherapy group. Group A receives 1 MHz therapeutic&#xD;
           ultrasound for 5 min at a frequency of 2-3 times per week at the painful upper trapezius&#xD;
           muscle. Group B receives hypertonic prolotherapy at perimysium of upper trapezius&#xD;
           muscle. The injectant is 5ml 5% dextrose solution. To ensure that the needle was not in&#xD;
           a blood vessel, the needle was aspirated before injection. The same physician (the&#xD;
           principal investigator) injects all patients to avoid inter-physician variability. No&#xD;
           other medication or physical modality was given to avoid efficacy interference in both&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The recruited patients receive evaluation before and after injection, and 2-week after&#xD;
           injection. The primary outcome is VAS-pain and VAS-sore (visual analogue scale) with a&#xD;
           score of 0-100, where 100 is the value representing the highest degree of pain. The&#xD;
           secondary outcomes are pain threshold, muscle tone, and SF-36-a questionnaire consists&#xD;
           of 36 items and 8 domains addressing the patient's perception of their QoL. Venous blood&#xD;
           and urine samples were collected at first visit and 2-week visit, respectively. The&#xD;
           blood samples were labeled with an anonymized ID number, centrifuged, and stored at -80&#xD;
           ºC in a locked freezer until the time of future processing. The buffy coat is separated&#xD;
           after centrifugation, and stored as well. The urine samples were aliquoted and stored at&#xD;
           -80 ºC in a locked freezer for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rescue therapy (cross-over treatment): If the participant does not satisfy with their&#xD;
           first round treatment and the improvement of VAS is less than 1.0, then they are&#xD;
           eligible to receive the rescue therapy-the treatment in the other group. And they will&#xD;
           return to clinic for another 2 weeks. The outcome variables will be collected in the 3rd&#xD;
           visit as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) DNA extraction and NGS-based sequencing and genotyping Genomic DNA will be extracted from&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the participants using the Gentra Puregene kit&#xD;
      following the protocol from the manufacturer, and subjected to agarose gel and O.D. ratio&#xD;
      tests to confirm its purity and concentration. DNA will be fragmented using Covaris, aiming&#xD;
      at the peak length of 800 bp. Illumina libraries will be generated from gDNA using TruSeq&#xD;
      Library Preparation Kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA capture probes will be custom-designed to target TRPV1, ASIC1a, ASIC3, Tac1, COMT, TCL1A,&#xD;
      POMC, RGS4, ASIC2, ASIC4, TRPA1, NK1R, G2A, GPR4, OGR1, TDAG8, TASK1, TASK2, TASK3, TREK1,&#xD;
      P2X2, P2X3, P2X5, TRPV4 and will be synthesized using the Roche KAPA HyperChoice protocol.&#xD;
      All the coding regions and non-coding regions (promoters, introns, 5' and 3' untranslated&#xD;
      regions) of these 8 genes will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGS target region enrichment will be applied to enrich/capture the target region (~148 Kb).&#xD;
      The enriched libraries will then be sequenced using Illumina MiSeq to generate paired-end&#xD;
      reads of 300 bp. The expected depth of the targeted regions will be 200x on average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Metabolomic and proteomic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Briefly, The LC-MS analyses of urine and serum involved using an Agilent 1290 UPLC&#xD;
           system (ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column, 2.1×100 mm; 1.8 µm; Waters, Milford, MA, USA)&#xD;
           coupled with the 6540-Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight (QTOF) mass system (Agilent&#xD;
           Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). MS raw files were converted to the mzXML format&#xD;
           using Trapper (ISB) and processed by TIPick, an in-house package. After TIPick&#xD;
           processing, the scaling-based normalization was performed according to the total ion&#xD;
           abundances from each UHPLC-MS data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The LC-MS lipidomic profiling was performed and described in detail. Concisely,&#xD;
           lipidomic profiling was run on a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.8 µm, Agilent&#xD;
           Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) for QTOF, as well as mobile phase A consisted of 0.1%&#xD;
           aqueous formic acid and 10 mM ammonium acetate and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1%&#xD;
           formic acid and 10 mM ammonium acetate in ACN/isopropyl alcohol (50/50). The autosampler&#xD;
           and column oven were maintained at 4°C and 55°C, respectively. The injection volume was&#xD;
           5 μl. MS acquisition was executed in the precursor ion scan (PIS) mode and multiple&#xD;
           reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All UPLC-MS raw data were converted to mzXML format by using Trapper (ISB) and&#xD;
           normalized by TIPick, an in-house package, as well as peak enhancement and peak chosen&#xD;
           for the targeted metabolites. An in-house database of sphingomyelins (SM),&#xD;
           lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), ceramides (Cer), phosphatidylcholines (PCs),&#xD;
           phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and cerebroside (CB) in the&#xD;
           Metabolomics Core Laboratory, Center of Genomic Medicine, National Taiwan University,&#xD;
           was used for screening.&#xD;
