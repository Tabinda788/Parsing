  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, randomised, interventional prospective cohort study to be undertaken&#xD;
      at offices of Intelligent Ultrasound Limited in Cardiff, United Kingdom.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance (NICE, 2009)&#xD;
      supports the use of ultrasound-guidance for regional anaesthesia (UGRA) procedures as a&#xD;
      consensus of clinical opinion agrees that nerve blocks are more successful and safer with&#xD;
      ultrasound (US) guidance. Despite this, UGRA remains a difficult technique to master. This&#xD;
      study will be used to determine whether ScanNav Anatomy PNB can support the performance of&#xD;
      non-expert anaesthetist in UGRA scanning by highlighting key anatomical structures on the US&#xD;
      image in real time.&#xD;

        24 participants will be recruited to represent the intended user population (anaesthetists&#xD;
        qualified to perform UGRA, but non-experts in the field of regional anaesthesia), with an&#xD;
        approximate 50/50 split between consultants and trainees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential study participants will be identified by approaching professional&#xD;
        anaesthesia/anaesthetics societies, networks (e.g., Wales Regional Anaesthesia Group -&#xD;
        South). Study participants will be required to attend one of the study assessment days at&#xD;
        Intelligent Ultrasound head office in Cardiff, UK.&#xD;
