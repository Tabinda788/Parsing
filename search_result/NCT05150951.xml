  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In rodents, novel exploration has been used to strengthen the consolidation of a variety of&#xD;
      hippocampal-dependent learning tasks. To our knowledge, no attempt have been made to&#xD;
      translate the effect of strengthening the memory of an extinction of a context conditioning&#xD;
      memory. This study uses virtual reality for both context conditioning and novel exploration&#xD;
      in an attempt at translating these findings from rodents to humans, thus, using novel&#xD;
      exploration to strengthen an extinction memory. Threat responses are measured with skin&#xD;
      conductance and startle responses. If this effect could be shown experimentally in humans,&#xD;
      that experimental setup could become an important tool in understanding important memory&#xD;
      processes of fear, such as reconsolidation and behavioral tagging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study employs healthy participants and includes three experimental sessions, roughly 24 h&#xD;
      apart. During the first session, participants undergo context conditioning in virtual reality&#xD;
      where the CS+ and CS- are two different rooms. During the second session, half of the&#xD;
      participants perform an exploration of a novel virtual environment, and the other half&#xD;
      performs a visual attention task. About 60 min later, participants undergo extinction to the&#xD;
      context conditioning performed in session 1, again in virtual reality. In session 3,&#xD;
      remaining threat responses are measured through a reinstatement procedure, again in virtual&#xD;
      reality.&#xD;
