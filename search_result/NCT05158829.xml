    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the virus Severe Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic. It is unclear&#xD;
      whether the relatively low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in people with CF (pwCF) is&#xD;
      due to enhanced infection prevention practices or whether pwCF have protective genetic/immune&#xD;
      factors. This study aims to prospectively assess the proportion of pwCF, including both&#xD;
      adults and children with CF who have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a two-year&#xD;
      period. This study will also examine whether pwCF who have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 have a&#xD;
      different clinical presentation and what impact this has on their CF disease. The proposed&#xD;
      study will recruit pwCF from paediatric and adult CF centres throughout the United Kingdom.&#xD;
      Serological testing to detect antibodies will be performed on blood samples taken at month 0,&#xD;
      6, 12, 18 and 24 with additional time-points if bloodwork is available via normal clinical&#xD;
      care. Clinical data on, lung function, CF-related medical history, pulmonary exacerbations,&#xD;
      antibiotic use, and microbiology and vaccination receipt, will be collected during routine&#xD;
      clinical assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations will be examined between socio-demographic and clinical variables and serologic&#xD;
      testing. The investigators will also examine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and analyse end-points to explore any age-related or gender-based differences, as&#xD;
      well as subgroup analysis of outcomes in lung-transplant recipients and pwCF receiving cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies. As pwCF receive&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination the investigators will perform a comparison of the development and&#xD;
      progression of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pwCF following natural infection and vaccination&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) that&#xD;
      involves repeated serial sampling of participants. This study design was chosen to provide&#xD;
      comprehensive information on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence changes over time and the subsequent&#xD;
      clinical impact on pwCF. The study will be conducted at participating CF centres over a&#xD;
      3-year period. Study participants will include paediatric and adult pwCF. For the United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK) section of the study, UK investigators in the European Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      Society-Clinical Trials Network (ECFS-CTN) will be invited to participate. Participating&#xD;
      investigators can enrol all eligible pwCF over a 12-month period. Participants are then&#xD;
      followed up for 24 months. Participants will donate blood samples at their routine clinic&#xD;
      visits. Blood samples will be collected at Day 0 (baseline), at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24 (to&#xD;
      coincide with routine clinical reviews). Additional blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      opportunistically every time the participant visits the clinic for blood draws. These blood&#xD;
      samples could be related to, routine care, annual review visits, pulmonary exacerbations&#xD;
      (PEx), CF complications or when initiating new treatments (e.g. CFTR modulators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum from blood samples will be shipped to a central laboratory (Queen's University Belfast)&#xD;
      for standardized measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside the blood samples the investigator will also collect clinical data from the&#xD;
      patient's health records and will input this data into the case report form (CRF). Clinical&#xD;
      data will be collected in conjunction with routine care visits, according to local clinical&#xD;
      practice. Investigators will collect data elements from information routinely recorded in the&#xD;
      patients' medical records. Data will be collected at baseline, month 6, 12, 18 and 24 as per&#xD;
      the study schedule, and at additional blood sampling timepoints as previously explained&#xD;
      above. Data collection will include routine data available from CF clinic follow-ups&#xD;
      including background demographic information, CF medical history, medications, exacerbation&#xD;
      information, sputum microbiology and clinical and lung function parameters. Information on&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection history and vaccine receipt will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum follow-up duration of participation in the study for each patient will be 24&#xD;
      months. This study duration (24-month follow-up) is justified as it provides sufficient time&#xD;
      to observe changes in antibody prevalence over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as&#xD;
      sufficient time to determine long term clinical outcomes for pwCF who are SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      seropositive. Furthermore, the investigators anticipate the 2-year study follow-up period&#xD;
      will provide sufficient time to observe the impact of vaccination on antibody levels given&#xD;
      that a number of vaccines are now commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the level of antibody responses between natural COVID-19&#xD;
      infection and vaccination in pwCF and how this varies over time. This will be achieved by&#xD;
      analyzing seroprevalence and antibody levels according to natural infection and vaccination&#xD;
      status and according to time of sample post infection or post vaccination, if known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Study sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who consent, a second blood sample will also be drawn into Ethylenediamine&#xD;
      tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes (plasma). Consent to this optional study sample would allow&#xD;
      this sample and any remaining serum (following antibody testing) to be stored for future&#xD;
      analysis and allow further research to be carried out on related studies to COVID-19 and CF.&#xD;
