  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparetic gait is characterized by strong asymmetries that could severely affect the&#xD;
      quality of life of stroke survivors. This asymmetry is due to motor deficits in the paretic&#xD;
      leg and the resulting compensations in the non-paretic limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of actively promoting gait&#xD;
      symmetry in hemiparetic patients by assessing the behavior of both paretic and non-paretic&#xD;
      lower limbs. To this end, the investigators use a unilateral active Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis&#xD;
      able to assist the paretic limb of hemiparetic patients during gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system is able to synchronize its action with the movement of the unassisted joints,&#xD;
      promoting a natural and intuitive interaction. The device generate the assistance according&#xD;
      to two differents strategies: (1) Replicating the movement of the helathy leg or (2) Inducing&#xD;
      a healthy gait pattern on the paretic leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a proper and natural interaction between the user and the exoskeleton&#xD;
      would enable the patients to consider the robot action as a part of their own gait&#xD;
      capability, improving their gait quality as consequence. Hemiparetic asymmetry is not only&#xD;
      due to impairments in the affected limb, but also it is the consequence of biomechanical&#xD;
      compensatory mechanisms that might arose in the non-paretic leg. We aim to assess the&#xD;
      adaptation process of the subject to the exoskeleton assistance, and to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of such human-robot interaction in both paretic and non-paretic legs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      - Brief name: Proof-of-concept of a unilateral robotic knee exoskeleton and evaluation of its&#xD;
      effects over gait symmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Materials: The investigators have developed a Knee-Ankle-Foot orthosis (KAFO) composed of&#xD;
      two joints aligned to the knee and ankle of the user. The length of its bars and the&#xD;
      positions of its braces can be tailored to the anthropometry of different users. The knee&#xD;
      joint is actuated by a DC brushless motor EC-60 flat 408057 (Maxon ag, Switzerland) coupled&#xD;
      with a harmonic drive CSD-20-160-2AGR (Harmonic Drive LLC, EE.UU.). The transmission ratio of&#xD;
      1:60 of this system enables the application of a mean torque of 35Nm. The ankle joint of the&#xD;
      prototype remains non-actuated and unlimited, enabling its free movement in the sagittal&#xD;
      plane. The total weight of the KAFO is about 4kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prototype is equipped with sensors that provide information on system variables that are&#xD;
      used for its control in real-time, such as the flexion angle of the robot joint or the&#xD;
      interaction torque between user and robot. In addition, the gait kinematic of the user is&#xD;
      measured by Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and the contact of both feet with the floor by&#xD;
      Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system uses an Adaptive Frequency Oscillator to estimate the continuous gait phase of the&#xD;
      contralateral limb and synchronically assists the paretic leg following two different control&#xD;
      strategies: (1) Replicating the movement of the sound leg (Echo Strategy) or (2) Inducing a&#xD;
      healthy gait pattern on the paretic leg (Pattern strategy). The action of the robot depends&#xD;
      on the gait phase of the assisted leg: during stance the robot reinforces the limb so the&#xD;
      system composed of the leg and the exoskeleton can load the user's weight and not collapse,&#xD;
      while during the swing phase the robot guides the limb's movement according to the&#xD;
      Assisted-As-Needed (AAN) paradigm creating a force tunnel around the prescribed trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Procedures: Subjects were instructed to walk on a treadmill at a constant speed during&#xD;
      trials of 5 minutes. All subjects carried out four different kinds of trials: (1) NoExo:&#xD;
      subjects only wore the inertial sensors and the insole pressure sensors to acquire their&#xD;
      basal motion; (2) Free: subjects wore the exoskeleton although the actuator was mechanically&#xD;
      decoupled, so it enabled the free movement of the knee; (3) Echo: the device provided gait&#xD;
      assistance following the Echo-control strategy; and (4) Pattern: the device provided gait&#xD;
      assistance following the Pattern strategy. During trials, patients wore a safety harness,&#xD;
      although it did not support any weight. Previously to the execution of the trials, the gait&#xD;
      velocity was self-selected by the subjects to a comfortable level. Subjects rested between&#xD;
      trials for five minutes at least, in order to avoid adaptation and learning effects from&#xD;
      trial to trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects also performed a previous trial under variable gait speed (VariableSpeed).&#xD;
      They walked over the treadmill as in the NoExo condition, although the gait speed randomly&#xD;
      varies from 1km/h to 3km/h in 0.2km/h steps for 15 seconds at least.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Intervention providers A physiotherapist and an engineer are present during the trials. The&#xD;
      first is responsible of assessing the basal gait of the subjects and evaluating his/her state&#xD;
      while the assistance is provided. The engineer is responsible of managing the device and&#xD;
      recording the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both researchers monitor fidelity to the intervention by direct supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modes of delivery The protocol is provided to one participant at a time. Each patient&#xD;
           completes the protocol once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location Hospital Beata María Ana (Madrid, Spain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tailoring and modifications The protocol remains unaltered across applications. The only&#xD;
           adaptation to patients is the choice of the comfortable gait speed for the trials.&#xD;
