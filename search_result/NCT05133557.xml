      The short-term effects of chewing gum containing xylitol and/or blackberry extract on oral&#xD;
      microbiota was studied. Fifty healthy adults participated in a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, cross-over design study. One group chewed 1 piece of xylitol-containing&#xD;
      chewing gum 4 times/day and the other chewed 1 piece of BBE+xylitol-containing gum 4&#xD;
      times/day. All wore a custom stent with a sterile enamel chip luted to the facial surface&#xD;
      during the 1-day experiment. Unstimulated saliva was collected at 8 am and 4 pm, and enamel&#xD;
      chips were harvested at 4 pm. A week later participants chewed gum from the other group. The&#xD;
      bacterial composition in saliva and on the enamel chips were assessed using real-time PCR.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Each volunteer was allocated xylitol-containing placebo gum or xylitol-containing BBE gum according to a predetermined randomization scheme. To ensure investigator blinding, test products were dispensed through other staff members who kept the assignment codes in sealed envelopes. Randomization resulted in half the participants receiving placebo gum (2 gram; 1 gram xylitol) first, and half receiving first the BBE gum (2 gram; 1 gram xylitol and 100 mg BBE) that were identical in size, shape, color and flavor.</masking_description>
