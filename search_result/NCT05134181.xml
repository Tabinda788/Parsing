  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-articular steroids have been also practiced since a long time. These agents have a&#xD;
      better and safer profile as compared to oral drugs in terms of adverse&#xD;
      effects/contraindications of the later. Moreover, Intra-articular steroids impart a better&#xD;
      pain relief by delivering and also delays any surgical intervention thereby improving the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without imaging, intra-articular injection has been shown in only 22% of patients so&#xD;
      ultrasound, fluoroscopic imaging and computerized tomographic (CT) are required to ensure&#xD;
      accuracy. Comparing to other guidance, ultrasound guided injection provides easy, safe,&#xD;
      accurate, non-invasive, inexpensive imaging and lacking exposure to radiation.&#xD;

      Technique of ultrasound-guided intra-articular SIJ injection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to recovery room, an IV line will be secured, ringer solution will be infused, O2&#xD;
      mask with 3l/min oxygen will be supplemented and RBS will be measured. Intervention will be&#xD;
      done at complete aseptic conditions by ultrasound at frequency of 4-5 MHz patient in prone&#xD;
      position. The ultrasound transducer will be oriented in a transverse orientation at the level&#xD;
      of the sacral hiatus. Here the sacral cornuae are identified. Moving the transducer laterally&#xD;
      from here, the lateral edge of the sacrum is now identified. This bony edge is&#xD;
&#xD;
      followed in a cephalad direction with the transducer maintained in a transverse orientation.&#xD;
      A second bony contour, the ileum, is now identified. The cleft between both bony contours&#xD;
      represented the sacroiliac joint. This will be found at 4.5 cm depth. Real-time imaging will&#xD;
      be used to direct a 22G spinal needle into the SIJ, where 2% lidocaine and triamcinolone or&#xD;
      methylprednisolone will be injected under direct vision.The needle will be removed, a sterile&#xD;
      dressing will be applied .then patient lay down at supine position at least 30 minutes with&#xD;
      blood pressure ,pulse ,O2 saturation and adverse effect monitoring .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the pain will be â‰¥ 4, NSAID will be given to control the pain in the form of 20 mg&#xD;
      piroxicam once daily after meal.&#xD;
