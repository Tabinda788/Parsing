      Many analgesic modalities have been investigated in pediatrics. The analgesic efficacy of&#xD;
      bilateral ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block in pediatric patients undergoing open&#xD;
      midline sternotomy will be examined. Methods: 60 patients aged 3- 12 years will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two groups: Control group will receive general anesthesia with bilateral sham&#xD;
      erector spinae plane block at the level of T6 transverse process using 0.3 ml/kg normal&#xD;
      saline on each side. Erector spinae plane block group will receive bilateral&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block at the level of T6 transverse process using 0.3&#xD;
      ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25% (on each side) with a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg. The postoperative pain&#xD;
      was assessed using Modified Objective Pain Scores (MOPS) which will be evaluated at 0, 1, 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after extubation, total consumption of intraoperative fentanyl&#xD;
      (1µg/kg IV in case of inadequate analgesia), time to first rescue analgesic administration&#xD;
      and postoperative paracetamol consumption will be recorded over the first 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;

      75 children with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I and II&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgical procedures through midline sternotomy . The patients with&#xD;
      preoperative ejection fraction &lt;35%, low-cardiac-output syndrome, recurrent ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmias, preoperative inotropic support, allergic to the amide type of local anesthetics&#xD;
      (LA), requiring intubation for more than 3 hours or re-exploration, and requiring redo or&#xD;
      emergency surgery will be excluded from the study. The enrolled children will be subsequently&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups using a computer generated random number table: Control group will&#xD;
      receive general anesthesia with bilateral sham erector spinae plane block at the level of T6&#xD;
      transverse process using 0.3 ml/kg normal saline on each side. Erector spinae plane block&#xD;
      group will receive bilateral ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block at the level of T6&#xD;
      transverse process using 0.3 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25% (on each side) with a maximum dose of 2&#xD;
      mg/kg. The postoperative pain will be managed with rescue intravenous (IV) fentanyl. Both the&#xD;
      groups will receive IV acetaminophen 15 mg/kg every 8 hours as a component of multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia. A routine preoperative assessment will be performed for all the patients.&#xD;
      Premedication in the form of 1 mg/kg promethazine syrup will be administered, 1 hour before&#xD;
      shifting to the operating room. Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitoring&#xD;
      will be instituted and the children were anesthetized as per institutional protocol. The&#xD;
      protocol constituted an induction with sevoflurane in oxygen 50% and air, peripheral IV&#xD;
      cannulation of appropriate size followed by IV midazolam, 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg, fentanyl, l to 2&#xD;
      mg/kg, and rocuronium, 0.6 mg/kg, to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Femoral arterial&#xD;
      access will be established for intra-arterial pressure monitoring. Central venous catheter&#xD;
      will be inserted in the right internal jugular vein for central venous pressure monitoring in&#xD;
      addition to the temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and near infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      monitoring. Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane (0.9-2%) in 50% oxygen in air&#xD;
      mixture and supplemental boluses of 0.1 mg/kg of atracurium, with the hemodynamics maintained&#xD;
      within 20% of the baseline. Ultrasound-Guided ESPB The ESPB will be performed with the child&#xD;
      in a right lateral decubitus position under aseptic precautions. A high frequency (6-13 MHz)&#xD;
      linear ultrasound transducer (Sonosite Inc, Bothell WA) was placed in a longitudinal&#xD;
      orientation over the T3 transverse process lateral to the spinous process. After identifying&#xD;
      the muscles (trapezius, rhomboid major, and erector spinae) above the hyperechoic transverse&#xD;
      process image, a 5-cm 22- guage Stimuplex A block needle (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) will&#xD;
      be inserted in-plane in a cephalo-caudad direction. The endpoint will be defined as the&#xD;
      needle pointing to the tip of transverse process piercing the erector spinae muscle. The LA&#xD;
      will be deposited at this position, close to the costotransverse foramen. The needle tip&#xD;
      position will be confirmed by hydrolocation with 0.5 to 1 mL of 1% lidocaine indicating&#xD;
      linear fluid spread lifting the fascial plane between the transverse process and erector&#xD;
      spinae muscle. After careful negative aspiration, 1.5 mg/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine will be&#xD;
      administered under ultrasound guidance . The process will be repeated with injection of 0.3&#xD;
      ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25%bupivacaine on the contralateral side adding up to a cumulative dose&#xD;
      of 2 mg/kg ropivacaine. Following sternotomy, adequate heparinization will be achieved with a&#xD;
      resultant activated clotting time &gt;480 seconds before the initiation of cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass in both the groups. After a satisfactory surgical correction, the patient will be&#xD;
      weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass followed by protamine administration. The patients will be&#xD;
      transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after completion of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative ICU Management and Postoperative Pain Assessment The electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry (Spo2) were monitored and&#xD;
      recorded throughout the postoperative period. The study subjects will be extubated within 2&#xD;
      to 3 hours postoperatively once the exubation criteria (conscious, hemodynamically stable,&#xD;
      (peak inspiratory pressure) PIP &lt;20 cmH2O above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)will&#xD;
      be fulfilled, no neuromuscular blockade, and normal arterial blood gas analysis).&#xD;
      Postoperative pain assessment will be performed using Modified Objective Pain Score (MOPS)9&#xD;
      at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and12hours post extubation. Acetaminophen, 15 mg/kg, IV, every 8&#xD;
      hours will be administered in both the groups. . A rescue analgesic fentanyl, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg,&#xD;
      will be administered when the MOPS score was≥ 4 at rest. Postoperative adverse effects such&#xD;
      as nausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, and complications such as LA toxicity, and vascular&#xD;
      puncture were recorded and treated. Statistical Analysis Primary and Secondary Endpoints MOPS&#xD;
      at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours post extubation constituted the primary endpoints. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints will include intraoperative fentanyl requirement, extubation time, time&#xD;
      to first rescue analgesic requirement, postoperative cumulative fentanyl requirement up to 12&#xD;
      hours, Ramsay sedation score, ICU stay, and incidence of adverse events.&#xD;
