  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between nystagmus intensity&#xD;
      and vestibular-ocular reflex gains by comparing Videonystagmography and video head impulse&#xD;
      test in patients with posterior semicircular canal-benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the vestibulo-ocular reflex&#xD;
      (VOR) gains obtained by video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and the slow phase velocity (SPV) of&#xD;
      nystagmus in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) originating from the&#xD;
      posterior semicircular canal (PSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were included in two groups. The study group consisted of patients with isolated&#xD;
      PSCC BPPV (PSCC-BPPV), and the control group consisted of age and gender-matched healthy&#xD;
      individuals. VOR gains were measured by vHIT in both the study group and the control group.&#xD;
      The SPV values of the nystagmus observed during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver in the study group&#xD;
      were recorded by Videonystagmography (VNG) and compared with the VOR gains.&#xD;
