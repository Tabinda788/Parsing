  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of CCT301-38 CAR modified&#xD;
      autologous T cells (CCT301-38) in subjects with relapsed or refractory AXL positive sarcomas&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, single-center Phase I dose escalation trial to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, DLT and MTD of CCT301-38 cell therapy in patients with AXL positive&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that meet inclusion criteria with positive AXL biopsy (IHC 1+ or greater in ≥50%&#xD;
      tumor cells) will receive CCT301-38 according to the 3+3 dose escalation design.&#xD;
