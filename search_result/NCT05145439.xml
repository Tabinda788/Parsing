  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single arm, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of TUS in the&#xD;
      treatment of DFU, with a blinded and randomized order of the three different treatment levels&#xD;
      (low, medium, and high acoustic intensities, corresponding to different peak negative&#xD;
      pressures). VibratoSleeve is an array of single element ultrasound transducers, driven in a&#xD;
      phased manner, and held in place externally by an adjustable sleeve. In this study, the&#xD;
      VibratoSleeve will be applied in a clinic setting and will be tested to demonstrate evidence&#xD;
      of an increase in distal limb perfusion in adult subjects with ischemic and neuroischemic&#xD;
      DFU.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this Dulcet clinical study, the VibratoSleeve TUS will be used on to assess its acute&#xD;
      vasodilatory and perfusion effects in a series of up to 12 evaluable diabetic subjects with&#xD;
      PAD and DFU. TUS will be delivered a wound care clinic, following debridement and wound&#xD;
      assessment. Each subject will receive one 90-minute TUS treatment in each of 3 treatment&#xD;
      sessions. Only one treatment level will be applied per session, at either low, medium, or&#xD;
      high acoustic intensity corresponding to peak negative pressures. The order of treatments&#xD;
      will be randomized; and subjects and research staff will be blinded as to the order of each&#xD;
      subject's treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed only to address acute changes in perfusion with each&#xD;
      dose-finding TUS treatment. After pre-treatment imaging, the VibratoSleeve device will be&#xD;
      fitted to the posterior calf and coupled to skin with ultrasound gel. Therapy will be&#xD;
      initiated using a Vibrato generator, gradually increasing acoustic output over the first 5&#xD;
      minutes of therapy until reaching the pre-determined randomized level, while assessing&#xD;
      patient comfort throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 3 individual one-day, 90-minute treatments will be carried out with at least a one-week&#xD;
      interval between each treatment session. All post-treatment acute assessments will take place&#xD;
      immediately following each day's treatment and no follow-up assessments will be required in&#xD;
      this study. This is entirely an acute-phase investigation.&#xD;

    <measure>Transcutaneous Oxygen Pressure (TcPO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>TcPO2 is a noninvasive test that directly measures the oxygen level of tissue beneath the skin. The test is painless for the subject and is measured by placing and inflating a cuff over the targeted ulcerative site, then slowly deflating it and identifying the cuff pressure at which the microcirculatory blood perfusion returns. The blood perfusion is detected using a laser Doppler probe.</description>
