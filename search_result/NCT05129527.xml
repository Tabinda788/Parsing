      mINSPIRERS_RCT aims to assess the magnitude of the effect of a mobile app for improving&#xD;
      asthma control in adolescents and adults with persistent asthma, followed at primary and&#xD;
      secondary care in Portugal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INSPIRERS_RCT is a pilot randomized, multicenter superiority clinical trial regarding the&#xD;
      effect of a mobile app together with usual care (experimental group) in comparison to usual&#xD;
      care alone (control group) in adolescents and adults with persistent asthma. The study&#xD;
      includes two face-to-face visits (initial visit and at 3 months), and 3 telephone interviews&#xD;
      (1 week, 1 month and 4 months), implemented in 32 primary (General Practice) and secondary&#xD;
      care centers (Allergy, Pediatrics, Pulmonology) in Portugal.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the experimental group, in addition to usual care, will be invited to use the InspirerMundi app for 4 months to support adherence to preventive inhaled medication and their asthma self-management. The purpose of the InspirerMundi app is to transform the adherence process into a positive experience through immediate and pleasant rewards. The InspirerMundi app integrates 3 main components: monitoring (symptoms, control, adherence), gaming and social/peer support.&#xD;
Participants will be able to include their action plan in the app. Within the action plan, the application can lead to changes in the medication effectively taken, which means that the therapeutic level can be adjusted according to the action plan.&#xD;
Participants in the experimental arm will be able to share with their physician, through the app, their medication adherence and asthma control data in the 3 months visit, and whenever they wish during the study period.</description>
