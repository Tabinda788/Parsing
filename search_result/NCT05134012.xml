  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a Phase 3, prospective, open-label, multicenter study of [15-O]-H2O injection for PET&#xD;
      imaging of subjects with suspected CAD. Approximately 182 evaluable participants with&#xD;
      suspected CAD referred for noninvasive stress testing will be included in the study at&#xD;
      approximately 10 study sites in the United States and Europe. Approximately 215 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled to account for an estimated 15% drop-out rate. Screening assessments will&#xD;
      occur between -21 and 0 days prior to enrollment to confirm eligibility. All participants&#xD;
      will receive two doses of [15-O]-H2O as part of a single PET imaging session (one dose at&#xD;
      rest and one during pharmacological stress with adenosine). A safety follow-up phone call&#xD;
      will occur 24 ± 8 hrs after completion of the [15-O]-H2O scan. If enrolled under Pathway 2&#xD;
      (EU only) no follow-up call will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>Subgroup analyses will be performed using the independent readers' assessments to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of P3 MT-100 [15-O]-H2O PET in subjects of special clinical interest (female, BMI≥30, diabetics, MVD). The sensitivity and specificity are defined as follows:&#xD;

    <description>A TEAE is an event that started or worsened in severity at or after start of [15-O]-H2O injection. Such adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed from the start time of [15-O]-H2O administration through 24 ± 8 hours after the start time of the second (stress) [15-O]-H2O administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female participants ≥18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Informed consent form (ICF) read, signed, and dated prior to any study procedures&#xD;
             being performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants who fall into any one of the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have been referred for an ICA directly of after non-invasive testing (e.g., SPECT&#xD;
                  or PET MPI, stress echo, CCTA, ETT).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Had a 15O H2O MPI study performed according to the study protocol and was&#xD;
                  referred for ICA (EU sites only).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Had an ICA with no intervention. However, if any stenosis &gt;40% but ≤70% was&#xD;
                  observed, an FFR assessment was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Had a CCTA with normal coronaries or minimal CAD (no stenosis &gt;20%). The SPECT&#xD;
                  study, PET 15O-H2O study, and ICA or CCTA testing need to be completed within a&#xD;
                  30-day window, with time 0 defined as the date of the first of these three tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP) must be non-pregnant, and non-lactating. For&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential, the results of a urine human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             (HCG) pregnancy test (with the result known on the day of drug administration) must be&#xD;
             negative; these patients must be practicing appropriate birth control from time of the&#xD;
             screening visit to 30 days after the radiopharmaceutical administration. For women who&#xD;
             are either surgically sterile (have a documented bilateral tubal ligation or&#xD;
             oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy) or are post-menopausal (cessation of menses for more&#xD;
             than 1 year); enrollment in the study without a pregnancy test at screening is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants are able to comply with all study procedures as described in the&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Participants are unable to undergo (even partially) any of the imaging procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with a known history of cardiac disease including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. myocardial infarction, previous coronary revascularization, or chronic ischemic&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. known left ventricular dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Participants with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block without a&#xD;
                  pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with claustrophobia to an extent that would limit their ability to&#xD;
             undergo SPECT and PET imaging (patients whose claustrophobia is known to be readily&#xD;
             controlled with drugs or psychological support may be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants who are on sildenafil (Viagra) or oral dipyridamole (Persantine,&#xD;
             Aggrenox) therapy and for whom its use cannot be terminated or suspended for ≥24 hours&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Participants with significant co-morbidities that would prevent appropriate completion&#xD;
             of the protocol procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants who have participated in another research study using investigational&#xD;
             drugs within the 30 days prior to enrollment (Day 0) (patients in observational&#xD;
             studies with approved agents and participants known to be on placebo may be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants who have previously participated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participants with a close affiliation with the investigational site, defined as a&#xD;
             close relative to the Investigator, or a dependent person such as an employee, student&#xD;
