  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-humans adaptive design open label trial to explore the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of SM-020. Multiple dosing cohorts will be enrolled. The first cohort will have a two-week&#xD;
      treatment period of twice daily applications followed by a four-week follow-up period. Based&#xD;
      on the results at any time from the first and subsequent cohorts, additional cohorts will&#xD;
      explore different dosing regimens.&#xD;
