    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the feasibility mHealth dietary app + health coaching for&#xD;
      improving primary outcomes (recruitment, retention, and adherence) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (perceived stress [ Perceived Stress Scale], exercise self-efficacy[Exercise Self-efficacy&#xD;
      Scale], vegetable intake [Fruit, Vegetables, and Fiber Screen] fat intake [Lose-it Premium&#xD;
      database], carbohydrate intake [Lose-it Premium database], weight, [Wi-Fi weight scale using&#xD;
      the Lose-it Premium database], and blood pressure [Wi-Fi blood pressure cuff using the&#xD;
      Lose-it Premium database].&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to shift the paradigm for promoting diet intake and physical&#xD;
      activity using education and self-report to provide a powerful combination of mHealth dietary&#xD;
      app and health coaching (set goals, provide ongoing feedback, and self-monitor behaviors). To&#xD;
      the investigators knowledge, this is the first time a mHealth dietary app and health coaching&#xD;
      intervention has been used in kidney transplant recipients to link real-time data for&#xD;
      monitoring dietary intake and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this work is to enhance well-being in kidney recipients via lifestyle&#xD;
      self-management of care for dietary intake and physical activity to ultimately prevent&#xD;
      chronic diseases. The proposed study is important because early weight gain after kidney&#xD;
      transplant is associated with adverse effects on the transplanted kidney function resulting&#xD;
      in increased health care cost and poor quality of life. Interventions are needed to monitor&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients diet and physical activity in real-time to prevent health&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;

    <description>The &quot;Lose-It&quot; app will be set up with Gmail accounts with unique unidentifiable codes developed by the research team. Participants be trained to enter their dietary intake and physical activity daily for 12-weeks. Participants will monitor their vegetable intake, fat intake, carbohydrate intake, weight, and blood pressure. Wi-Fi connected weight scales and blood pressure cuff will be supplied for weight and blood pressure monitoring. Participants will be taught how to sync the data from the scales and blood pressure cuff to the app for the research team to access. Participants will perform a return demonstration to confirm that they can record their dietary intake daily, physical activity, weight, and blood pressure using the &quot;Lose-It&quot; app. We also review with the participant the &quot;My Plate&quot; method for proper nutrition and the steps to distance conversion chart.</description>
