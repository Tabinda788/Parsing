      This observational study evaluates whether lung sound analysis with LungPass device can be&#xD;
      used to differentiate exacerbation and stable state asthma and COPD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study comprised patients with moderate or severe COPD or&#xD;
      asthma exacerbation in primary care settings. Patients will be examined twice - during an&#xD;
      exacerbation of the disease and in a stable phase. Patients will undergo routine clinical&#xD;
      examination including lung auscultation with conventional stethoscope and LungPass device.&#xD;
      Moreover, symptoms and anamnesis data, results of symptoms questionnaires (CAT for COPD and&#xD;
      ACQ-5 for asthma), result of diagnostic questionnaire from the LungPass App, spirometry data,&#xD;
      serum procalcitonin (for COPD patients), C-reactive protein, white blood cell count and blood&#xD;
      eosinophil count, results of sputum cytology examination, Х-ray results (if carried out&#xD;
      according to indications) will be collected.&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited upon presentation with a moderate or severe COPD or asthma&#xD;
        exacerbation in primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is planned to recruit 100 patients with asthma and 100 patients with COPD at the initial&#xD;
        study stage. The final calculation of the sample size will be carried out after receiving&#xD;
        the preliminary results of the study. After that, the sample size will be adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be examined twice - during an exacerbation of the disease and in a stable&#xD;
        phase.&#xD;
