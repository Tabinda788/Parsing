      This study is a single center, open, dose increasing and dose expanding phase I clinical&#xD;
      study. The dose increasing method of &quot;3 + 3&quot; is used to explore the safety, tolerance and PK&#xD;
      characteristics of BAT4706 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors. After the&#xD;
      completion of dose increment, 1-2 tolerated doses were selected for extended research on&#xD;
      melanoma (20-40 cases), so as to provide recommended doses for subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;

    <description>First Phase: dose escalation study. It was divided into four dose groups: 0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg and 1.0mg/kg. The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of bat4706 injection were explored according to the 3 + 3 dose increasing mode. It is expected that 12-24 cases will be included in the group Second Phase: dose expansion study. After the completion of dose increment, 1-2 tolerated doses were selected for extended research on melanoma (20-40 cases), so as to provide recommended doses for subsequent clinical trials</description>
