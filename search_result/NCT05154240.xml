  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2-part (Part A and B), double-blind, placebo controlled single&#xD;
      and multiple ascending doses study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of&#xD;
      INS018_055 when administered as oral doses to healthy subjects. Additionally, this study will&#xD;
      investigate the impact of food on the PK of INS018_055.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (Single Ascending Dose [SAD]):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight healthy subjects will be assigned to each of up to 5 sequential dose cohorts and will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned within each dose cohort to receive INS018_055 or a matched placebo in a&#xD;
      ratio of 3:1 (6 active, 2 placebo) on Day 1 for a total of up to approximately 40 subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects in Part A will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 and dosed on Day 1 after&#xD;
      fasting (nothing to eat or drink, except water) for at least 10 hours. Water is not allowed 1&#xD;
      hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing. Water can be consumed ad libitum at other times.&#xD;
      Subjects will remain fasted on Day 1 for 4 hours after dosing. Subjects will be discharged&#xD;
      from the study site on Day 4, after the scheduled procedures and review of the Day 4 safety&#xD;
      data by the investigator (or designee). Subjects will come back for an end of study (EOS)&#xD;
      visit on Day 8 (Â± 1 day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sentinel cohort of 2 subjects will be used to mitigate the risk of unexpected adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) not predicted by preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies for each dosing&#xD;
      cohort, starting with Cohort 1 (the initial dose cohort). The sentinel subjects will be dosed&#xD;
      in a blinded fashion (1 active, 1 placebo) and monitored for at least 1 day before the&#xD;
      remaining 6 subjects in that cohort are dosed. Initiation of dosing of the remaining 6&#xD;
      subjects will depend on an initial safety review by the investigator indicating that&#xD;
      administration of the study treatment was safe and well tolerated in the sentinel subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will occur only after the real time PK, safety, and tolerability data&#xD;
      (including reported AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory results up to 48 hours after dosing) of the preceding dose cohort for at&#xD;
      least 6 subjects are assessed and the study treatment is deemed safe and well tolerated by&#xD;
      the safety review committee (SRC). As new safety and/or PK data become available, the&#xD;
      anticipated dose escalation scheme may change following a review of the data by the SRC.&#xD;
      Preliminary PK data from subjects in this study will help guide dose escalation to higher&#xD;
      doses. Dose escalation in Cohorts 4 and 5 will only occur after the PK data from at least the&#xD;
      first 2 cohorts have been assessed and deemed sufficient to model exposures for Cohorts 4 and&#xD;
      5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Effect Assessment (Cohort 4 in Part A only): Subjects in Cohort 4 of Part A will&#xD;
      participate in a food effect arm. The actual dose level for food effect cohort is subject to&#xD;
      change and will be confirmed by the SRC after review of data from at least the first 2&#xD;
      cohorts of the SAD. Following the standard SAD dosing on Day 1 and at least 3 days of follow&#xD;
      up/washout (or 5 times the estimated half-life of INS018_055 based on the observed data,&#xD;
      whichever is longer) (Period 1), enrolled subjects will enter Period 2 and be re administered&#xD;
      the same dose of INS018_055 or matching placebo (the same treatment that they received on Day&#xD;
      1 of Period 1) after completing a standard high-fat meal. Subjects will fast (nothing to eat&#xD;
      and drink, except water) for at least 10 hours overnight and receive a standard high-fat&#xD;
      breakfast 30 minutes prior to dosing. The high-fat breakfast will be consumed within&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes. Subjects will remain at the study site on Day 4 of Period 2 until&#xD;
      the scheduled procedures and review of the Day 4 safety data by the investigator (or&#xD;
      designee) are completed. The washout period of at least 3 days (or 5 times the estimated half&#xD;
      life of INS018_055 based on the observed data, whichever is longer) may be extended based on&#xD;
      available PK data from previous cohorts. The Day -1 procedures will not be repeated for&#xD;
      Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations will be performed at selected time points throughout the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      also be closely monitored for AEs throughout the study. Blood samples for PK will be&#xD;
      collected up to 72 hours after study treatment administration on Day 1 for all cohorts. For&#xD;
      biomarkers (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells), blood samples will be collected at check-in (Day -1), Day&#xD;
      2, and Day 4 after administration of INS018_055. Fecal occult blood tests will be done with&#xD;
      all stools passed at screening, check-in (Day -1), and during the 72 hour observation period.&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged on Day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B (Multiple Ascending Dose [MAD]):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight healthy subjects will be assigned to each of up to 5 sequential once daily (QD) or&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) dose cohorts and will be randomly assigned within each dose cohort to&#xD;
      receive INS018_055 or a matched placebo for 10 days in a ratio of 3:1 (6 active, 2 placebo),&#xD;
      for a total of up to approximately 40 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Part B will begin dosing, after safety and tolerability data (including reported&#xD;
      AEs, physical examination, clinical laboratory results, 12-lead ECGs, and vital signs) from&#xD;
      at least the first 3 cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 3) in Part A are assessed and the study treatment&#xD;
      is deemed safe and well tolerated by the SRC. Additionally, sufficient PK data from at least&#xD;
      the first 3 cohorts of Part A must be obtained to model exposures in Part B. The dosing&#xD;
      schedule, either QD or BID, will be decided by the SRC after review of the PK, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability data from the first 3 cohorts of Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial MAD cohorts will begin dosing with the remaining SAD cohorts. The top dose&#xD;
      explored in Part B will not exceed the maximum dose explored in Part A. Subsequent dose&#xD;
      escalations in Part B will not occur until the safety (including AEs, physical examination,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs) and tolerability data up to and&#xD;
      including Day 14 of the preceding MAD dose cohort for at least 6 subjects are assessed and&#xD;
      the study treatment is deemed safe by the SRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As new safety or PK data become available, the dose escalation scheme may change. Subjects&#xD;
      may not receive a subsequent higher dose and may instead be administered a lower dose or may&#xD;
      repeat the same daily dose with a different administration schema, eg, BID instead of QD&#xD;
      dosing, to achieve lower maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) values, particularly if&#xD;
      the safety findings are believed to be linked to the Cmax values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest dose in the MAD (either QD or BID) will be dosed in a staggered way if accrued PK&#xD;
      data from previous cohorts predict potential exposures above the no observed adverse effect&#xD;
      level, with 2 subjects starting dosing at least 7 days before the remaining 6 subjects;&#xD;
      initiation of dosing of the remaining 6 subjects will depend on an initial safety review by&#xD;
      the investigator indicating that administration of the study treatment was safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated in the sentinel subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject in Part B will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 and will begin daily&#xD;
      dosing on Day 1. Study treatment is to be administered daily at approximately the same time&#xD;
      in the morning. For BID dosing, the second dose of study treatment will be administered&#xD;
      approximately 12 hours after the morning dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the morning dosing on Days 1 and 10 for Cohorts 6 to 10, subjects will fast (nothing&#xD;
      to eat and drink, except water) for at least 10 hours overnight and remain fasted for 4 hours&#xD;
      after study treatment administration. Water is not allowed 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after&#xD;
      dosing. Water can be consumed ad libitum at other times. Water is not restricted for the&#xD;
      evening doses when study treatment is being dosed BID. On Days 1 and 10, lunch will be&#xD;
      provided approximately 4 hours after the morning dose, dinner will be provided approximately&#xD;
      10 hours after the morning dose, and a snack will be provided approximately 13 hours after&#xD;
      the morning dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2 to 9 for Cohorts 6 to 10, breakfast will be provided approximately 60 minutes after&#xD;
      study treatment administration. Standardized meals will be provided to the subjects&#xD;
      throughout the study. Lunch will be provided approximately 4 hours after the morning dose,&#xD;
      dinner will be provided approximately 10 hours after the morning dose, and a snack will be&#xD;
      provided approximately 13 hours after the morning dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations (including liver function test results) will be performed at selected time points&#xD;
      throughout the dosing interval. Subjects will be closely monitored for AEs throughout the&#xD;
      study. Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected up to 72 hours after study treatment&#xD;
      administration on Day 10. Urine samples for PK analysis will be collected before dosing (Day&#xD;
      1 as a single void collected within 0 to 24 hours) and over the following intervals after&#xD;
      dosing: 0 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours on Day 1 and 0 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 12, 12&#xD;
      to 24, and 24 to 48 hours on Day 10 for both QD and BID cohorts. For biomarkers (CD4+ and&#xD;
      CD8+ T-cells), blood samples will be collected at selected time points for QD and BID dosing&#xD;
      cohorts. Fecal occult blood tests will be done with all stool samples at screening, check-in&#xD;
      (Day 1), and throughout Part B on site observation periods, ie, up to Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the study site on Day 14, after the scheduled procedures and&#xD;
      review of the safety data by the investigator (or designee). Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      study site on Day 28 (Â± 3 days) for an EOS visit.&#xD;

             (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is &gt;140 mm Hg&#xD;
             (systolic) or &gt;90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the&#xD;
             average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has 12-lead ECG demonstrating corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF)&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. The subject has any medical history of disease that has the potential to cause a rise&#xD;
             in total bilirubin over the ULN. Subjects with borderline clinical laboratory values&#xD;
             outside the reference range may be included in the study if the investigator deems&#xD;
             that the values are not clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have a direct bilirubin&#xD;

             including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation&#xD;
             or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
