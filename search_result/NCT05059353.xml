  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness and safety of a digitally&#xD;
      based multidomain intervention in patients with MCI. In addition, a portion of cognitively&#xD;
      normal subjects and caregivers of patients with MCI will also be recruited as an exploratory&#xD;
      cohort. We hope that the digital platform will improve the overall cognition and quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with MCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3 groups of participants will be recruited. For the participants in the MCI (group A) and&#xD;
      cognitively normal subjects (group B), they will be provided with a digital tablet and a&#xD;
      wearable device. The digital tablet will be pre-loaded with 10 modules, 1 module per week (1&#xD;
      hour) for 10 weeks to be completed at home. The wearable device will be used to track and&#xD;
      collect physiological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the caregivers of the patients with MCI (group C), they will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire during screening visit and follow-up visit, and to use the caregiver app during&#xD;
      the intervention period.&#xD;

    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.&#xD;
Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content.&#xD;
The scoring ranges from 0 to 3 per item. The higher the score, the greater the sense of depression, anxiety or stress.</description>

    <description>Education (5-10 mins). This session is to educate patients on instrumental activities of daily living such as the importance of companionship, medication, finance, home, travel, and kitchen safety. The content will be delivered using video and text-based material in English.&#xD;
Physical Activity (10 mins). This session includes activities such as brisk walking and yoga. Participants will be allowed to choose their preferred exercise option from the menu.&#xD;
Reminiscence Therapy (20 mins). This session includes recollection of events using directed questions, and a collection of photos from the past. Participants will be asked to share about any aspect related to the given topics using text or audio.&#xD;
Cognitive Games (20 mins). Participants will be asked to play games using their fingers to control characters on the screen to achieve goals. These games are designed to train different cognitive abilities, including attention, memory, executive functioning, and processing speed.</description>
