  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is a novel medical challenge, particularly because of the systemic&#xD;
      nature of this disease. Indeed, COVID-19 affects several organs and systems at once. The&#xD;
      brain is affected in several ways: direct infection of nerve cells by SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      inflammation of the central nervous system, severe systemic inflammation damaging nerve&#xD;
      cells, global cerebral ischaemia related to respiratory failure, thromboembolic events&#xD;
      related to increased intravascular coagulation and severe psychological stress. As a result,&#xD;
      COVID-19 sometimes manifests as neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as dizziness,&#xD;
      sleep disturbances, cognitive deficits, delirium, or severe depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden loss of smell is a common symptom associated with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection of&#xD;
      neurons in the olfactory system has been reported in both hamsters and humans. The vast&#xD;
      majority of COVID-19 patients recover their olfactory function within a few weeks. However, a&#xD;
      significant minority of infected individuals (1 in 5 cases) still suffers from olfactory&#xD;
      disorders (anosmia, hyposmia and/or parosmia) several months after the primary infection.&#xD;
      These olfactory disorders are frequently associated with depressive behaviour and cognitive&#xD;
      complaints. In PET scans, it is even possible to correlate this cognitive dysfunction with&#xD;
      hypometabolism of certain brain regions, including the olfactory gyrus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes, during one year, to evaluate and follow the evolution of the olfactory&#xD;
      capacities of patients suffering from persistent smell disorder since one year (+/- 4 months)&#xD;
      following COVID-19. We propose to study the link between viral persistence in the olfactory&#xD;
      sensory organ, chronic inflammation, and central damage to the olfactory system. The&#xD;
      follow-up of the evolution of olfactory and neurocognitive capacities, in an integrative way&#xD;
      by means of molecular, physiological and behavioural approaches, will inform us on the&#xD;
      specificities of &quot;COVID-long&quot; and on the level of peripheral and/or central damage of the&#xD;
      olfactory system.&#xD;

      Prospective monocentric descriptive study. Evaluation of COVID-19 patients with persistent&#xD;
      loss of smell during 2 visits at 1 year intervals (V1 and V2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V1 :The following examinations will be carried out specifically for the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sampling;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recording of olfactory evoked potentials;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological examination and neuropsychological assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
      V2 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All examinations performed at V1 will be repeated at V2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the following examinations are not carried out during care within 3 weeks of V2, they will&#xD;
      be carried out as part of the research during this V2 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal endoscopy ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of olfactory and gustatory functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following explorations will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passing of two olfactory and gustatory scales; Olfactory and gustatory disorders will be&#xD;
           quantified using two scales, the visual analogue scale VAS and the modified TSS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sniffin Stick test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, MRI data from clinical care will be collected.&#xD;
