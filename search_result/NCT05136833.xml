  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an exploratory clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      treatment with a vaccine against tuberculosis (RUTI®) given at the same time as standard&#xD;
      treatment in patients with tuberculosis. It is a prospective, randomized (1:1), double-blind,&#xD;
      multicentre, placebo-controlled clinical phase IIb trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized (1: 1) to receive an inoculation of RUTI® or placebo at the same&#xD;
      time that standard treatment is started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard TB treatment will continue after RUTI® or placebo administration according to&#xD;
      SOC guidelines. All the patients will be followed up 6 months after the vaccination or until&#xD;
      the end of SOC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all the patients have completed the week 2 follow-up, a Data Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      (DSMB) will be established to review all relevant safety and toxicity data.&#xD;

             about 2 hours).&#xD;
