  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most aggressive blood cancers, with a very low&#xD;
      survival rate and few options for participants who are unable to undergo intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the current standard of care. This study is to evaluate how safe the&#xD;
      combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is and how effective the combination of azacitidine&#xD;
      and venetoclax is in adult participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in China. Adverse&#xD;
      events and change in disease state will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is being evaluated in the treatment of acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML). Participants will receive azacitidine with increasing doses of&#xD;
      venetoclax. Adult participants with a diagnosis of AML will be enrolled. Around 40&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 30 sites in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At cycle 1 during ramp-up period, participants will receive venetoclax oral tablets once&#xD;
      daily in increasing doses until the study dose is achieved on day 3. Then ventoclax oral&#xD;
      tablets will continue once daily thereafter. Azacitidine will be given by subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection (SC) for 7 days beginning on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, and&#xD;
      checking for side effects.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study.</description>

    <description>CR + CRi is defined as achieving a CR or CRi at any time point during the study prior to the start of post-treatment anti-AML therapies per the modified IWG criteria for AML. CR is defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 10^3/μL, platelets &gt; 10^5/μL, red cell transfusion independence, and bone marrow with &lt; 5% blasts. Absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease. CRi is defined as all of the criteria for CR except for residual neutropenia &lt;= 10^3/μL (1000/μL) or thrombocytopenia &lt;= 10^5/μL (100,000/μL). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependence is also defined as CRi.</description>
