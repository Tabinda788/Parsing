      Objectives To compare oral health (dental caries, periodontal status, and erosive tooth wear&#xD;
      (ETW)), diet and oral hygiene habits between obese and normal weight adolescents, and to&#xD;
      explore possible risk associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods In this case-control study, a convenient sample of 81 obese adolescents&#xD;
      (age range 11-18) from a rehabilitation centre, and 81 age-sex-matched normal weight&#xD;
      adolescents were selected. Groups were defined using the Body Mass Index and growth curves&#xD;
      for Flemish. Oral health was measured using DMFT, gingival, plaque and BEWE index. A&#xD;
      validated questionnaire was utilized to assess diet and oral hygiene habits.&#xD;

      Participants and ethical aspects For this case-control study, a total of 162 adolescents&#xD;
      residing in Belgium were examined between July 2015 and October 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height and weight were measured to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the participants.&#xD;
      Obese and normal weight groups were defined using the BMI according to the European Childhood&#xD;
      Obesity Group (ECOG) and the growth curves for Flemish boys and girls (2-20years). Only the&#xD;
      participants with obesity were included in the case group (having a BMI above the 97th&#xD;
      percentile + 2.17 to+2.18 SDS), whereas only the participants with normal weight were&#xD;
      included in the control group (BMI between the 10th and 90th percentile -1.64 to +1.64 SDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination Anthropometrical and dental examinations were performed in the&#xD;
      educational institutions. Before scoring, dental surfaces were dried using sterile gauze.&#xD;
      Standard illumination (LED head lamps), sterile number five mouth mirrors and CPI periodontal&#xD;
      probes (WHO 1997) were used. Caries experience was screened using DMFT index (Decayed,&#xD;
      Missing, Filled Teeth) with a subdivision for D1 (early caries, 'white spots'), D2 (enamel&#xD;
      caries) or D3 (dentine caries). The periodontal status was evaluated by measuring the&#xD;
      Gingivitis index (Silness and Loë, 1963), Plaque index (Silness and Loë, 1964) and the&#xD;
      presence of periodontal pockets (≥4mm) in all Ramfjord teeth (1.6, 2.1, 2.4, 3.6, 4.1 and&#xD;
      4.4). Data were obtained from the neighbouring tooth in cases where one of these teeth were&#xD;
      not present. Deciduous teeth and teeth with developmental disturbances were excluded.&#xD;
      Regarding ETW, prevalence and severity was recorded using the Basic Erosive Wear Examination&#xD;
      (BEWE index). According to this index, every permanent tooth surface is evaluated and is&#xD;
      classified into a 4 score criteria, &quot;0&quot; being an indication for the absence of ETW, &quot;1&quot; being&#xD;
      initial loss of surface texture, &quot;2&quot;* being distinct defect, hard tissue loss affecting less&#xD;
      than 50% of tooth surface and &quot;3&quot;* being an indication for hard tissue loss and presence of&#xD;
      ETW in more than the 50% of the surface (*usually involving dentin). The final BEWE sum score&#xD;
      was the result of the sum of the highest score recorded per sextant .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproducibility Two paediatric dentists (FM and SD) were educated, instructed and calibrated&#xD;
      for DMFT index. The examiners scored twice several clinical cases in two sessions separated&#xD;
      by a two-week period. Then, the examiners scores were compared against an experienced&#xD;
      benchmark (LM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire A validated questionnaire was applied in order to assess oral hygiene and&#xD;
      dietary habits. Prior to initiation of the study, a content validation of the questionnaire&#xD;
      was performed by five professors with experience in epidemiology. For the reliability of the&#xD;
      questionnaire, a group of 20 students (15-year-old) were asked to complete the questionnaire&#xD;
      twice separated by a two-week period. Once validated, the questionnaire was applied to each&#xD;
      participant of the study on the same day of dental examination. Participants were asked to&#xD;
      answer the questionnaire according to their habits just before they enter the rehabilitation&#xD;
      centre.&#xD;

        Cases were all the obese children/adolescents (N=81; age range 11 to 18 years-old) who were&#xD;
        recently participating in a treatment program for obese patients in a rehabilitation centre&#xD;
        for chronic diseases (Zee Preventorium, De Haan, Belgium). Based on the number of cases, 81&#xD;
        normal weight students of two Belgian secondary schools (Deinze, Belgium) were recruited as&#xD;
        controls. Controls were sex-age-matched, had the same education level and socioeconomic&#xD;
        status (SES).&#xD;
