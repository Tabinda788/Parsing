  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will investigate the independent effects of an environmental intervention&#xD;
      (E only), an individual-level eHealth phone program intervention (I only), or both (E+I) on&#xD;
      changes in moderate intensity physical activity. A cluster randomized design will be&#xD;
      implemented whereby all residents of one of 12 of Boston's public housing developments (PHDs)&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the four study groups (E only, I only, E+I, or control). The&#xD;
      activities with this multilevel design include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening/enrollment/baseline assessment activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Environmental components to promote moderate intensity walking and other physical&#xD;
           activity at the PHDs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changing the environment surrounding the development making it more amenable to walking&#xD;
           through the creation of walking trails and walking maps; and advocating for changes to&#xD;
           the built environment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy Living Advocates (HLA)-led walking groups within the community&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual level components to increase motivation and self-efficacy for physical&#xD;
           activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eHealth program, an automated telephone-based physical activity program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-month and 24-month follow up assessment activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the participants living in the PHDs in any of the three&#xD;
      intervention groups (E only, I only, and E+I combined) will increase minutes of moderate&#xD;
      intensity physical activity more than participants in control group developments at 24-month&#xD;
      follow up. It is further expected that delivery of an intervention package targeting&#xD;
      environmental and social cues to become active, combined with an individual level&#xD;
      intervention, will improve overall physical activity levels to recommended guidelines at the&#xD;
      development level. The findings will inform future health promotion efforts among residents&#xD;
      in public housing developments.&#xD;
