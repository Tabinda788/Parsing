  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical interventions are not only a physiological trauma, but also a psychological and&#xD;
      social trauma because they cause deterioration of the individual's comfort. Comfort is among&#xD;
      the most basic human needs and provides a better care output. One of the conditions that&#xD;
      cause deterioration of comfort and anxiety in patients is hunger and thirst before surgery.&#xD;
      Since 1994, several guides published by professional groups in many countries on&#xD;
      pre-operative fasting periods have published that clear liquids can be taken up to 2 hours&#xD;
      before the surgery in elective surgeries, and solid foods can be taken up to 6 hours before&#xD;
      the surgery. One of the basic principles of ERAS protocols, which include evidence-based care&#xD;
      interventions applied at all stages of the surgical process, for the preoperative period is&#xD;
      to ensure that the patient takes a carbohydrate drink up to two hours before anesthesia and&#xD;
      to shorten the long fasting period. In many countries, the problems experienced by patients&#xD;
      as a result of long-term hunger have been identified. When the comfort status of the patients&#xD;
      who were given carbohydrate-rich drinks before the surgery was examined, it was observed that&#xD;
      the symptoms such as thirst, hunger, insufficiency, fatigue, nausea, pain, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression were reduced and oral carbohydrate solutions were recommended. In the literature,&#xD;
      it is stated that the prolongation of the fasting period causes an increase in the anxiety of&#xD;
      the person and negatively affects his comfort, and it is recommended to drink 800 ml of&#xD;
      carbohydrate liquid food until midnight the day before the surgery and 400 ml of liquid&#xD;
      carbohydrate food 2-3 hours before the surgery in order to provide metabolic satiety. The&#xD;
      nurse, who is one of the health workers responsible for the care of the patient, has to&#xD;
      manage the restriction of oral food and liquid intake and the comfort of the patient in the&#xD;
      best way before the operation. Accordingly, in our study, the answers were sought whether the&#xD;
      oral carbohydrate solution given before hip arthroplasty had an effect on anxiety and patient&#xD;
      comfort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip arthroplasty (HA) is a very common treatment method in orthopedic surgery worldwide. HA&#xD;
      is considered a successful, safe and cost-effective medical intervention to regain pain-free&#xD;
      mobility and functionality of the hip joint in patients with severe joint disease or trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is stated that the annual number of patients undergoing HA in the United States is&#xD;
      193,000, and this number is approximately one million worldwide. In the next 15 years, it is&#xD;
      estimated that the number of patients undergoing HA will continue to increase in the world&#xD;
      and in Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is stated that health care services should start in the preoperative period and continue&#xD;
      in the postoperative period, especially in HA surgeries performed due to limitation of&#xD;
      mobility. Because HA application is seen as a major surgical intervention and as with many&#xD;
      surgical interventions, it can affect the individual as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical intervention is a combination of anesthesia, drug therapy, tissue trauma, blood loss&#xD;
      and body temperature changes. These developing events stimulate metabolic changes and cause&#xD;
      postoperative anxiety and stress response at the same time. Exposure of the human body to&#xD;
      surgery or other trauma elicits a neurohumoral response and activates a catabolic process.&#xD;
      Surgical stress causes an increase in the release of regulatory hormones such as&#xD;
      catecholamine, glucagon and cortisol in the body and a decrease in insulin sensitivity. The&#xD;
      increase in cortisol level leads to the development of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      which have an important effect on the healing process. Changes in this process increase the&#xD;
      risk of postoperative complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, fasting the patient overnight as a standard practice in the preoperative&#xD;
      period in order to reduce the risk of lung aspiration in elective surgery patients may cause&#xD;
      a change in the insulin glucagon ratio. This increases the stress response to surgical trauma&#xD;
      and may have a major impact on glycemic control and insulin resistance. Prolongation of the&#xD;
      preoperative fasting period may cause negative effects such as feeling of hunger, anxiety,&#xD;
      restlessness, headache, dehydration, hypovolemia and hypoglycemia. However, the increase in&#xD;
      the preoperative fasting period causes a decrease in patient satisfaction, and causes&#xD;
      undesirable conditions such as nausea and vomiting in the postoperative period, delaying the&#xD;
      healing process and prolonging the hospital stay of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the guidelines published in countries such as America, Canada and Europe, it is reported&#xD;
      that the longer the fasting period, the negative effects on patient safety and comfort. In&#xD;
      elective surgeries, it is recommended that clear liquids can be consumed up to the last two&#xD;
      hours and solid foods up to six hours before the surgical procedure in order to reduce&#xD;
      anxiety, reduce the negative effects of the stress response on the patient, and ensure&#xD;
      patient comfort. In the guideline published by the Turkish Society of Anesthesiology and&#xD;
      Reanimation (TARD) in 2005, it is recommended to comply with these criteria in patients who&#xD;
      will undergo elective surgery. Therefore, modern perioperative care aims at maximizing the&#xD;
      shortening of the fasting period before an elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, one of the elements of modern&#xD;
      perioperative care is the administration of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading (OCS). In&#xD;
      the literature; oral carbohydrate solution administration before elective surgery; It is&#xD;
      stated that it is absorbed from the stomach of the patient in an average of 90 minutes,&#xD;
      reduces protein catabolism in the muscles, increases glycogen storage in the liver and&#xD;
      reduces insulin resistance. In addition, in other studies conducted in abdominal, orthopedic&#xD;
      and cardiac surgery; It has been determined that OCS reduces postoperative metabolic stress,&#xD;
      preserves lean body mass and muscle strength, and increases patient comfort by reducing the&#xD;
      length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of patient comfort is defined as the comfort that facilitates daily life. In&#xD;
      providing the health care needs, which are extremely stressful for the patient, nurses apply&#xD;
      nursing interventions for comfort, which is a concept unique to the individual, allowing the&#xD;
      patient to experience less anxiety, be more peaceful and overcome their problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discomforts experienced by the patient during the operation or procedures (pain, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, hypothermia, anxiety, etc.) may increase the patient's anxiety and may be the main&#xD;
      reason for the decrease in comfort. The nurse should provide all necessary nursing&#xD;
      interventions to reduce or eliminate the situations that will cause anxiety in the patient&#xD;
      before and after each procedure to be applied to the patient. With all these practices,&#xD;
      patients can receive a quality nursing care, contribute to their faster recovery and increase&#xD;
      their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality patient care in surgical nursing; should be shaped within the framework of ethical&#xD;
      principles such as not harming and providing benefit. In the literature; Evidence for the&#xD;
      duration of fasting in the preoperative period is reflected in clinical practice, emphasizing&#xD;
      the need to prevent patients from being harmed without putting them at risk. Thus, by&#xD;
      managing the hunger period within the scope of evidence-based practices; It is stated that&#xD;
      many therapeutic benefits can be obtained, such as reducing anxiety, discomfort, headache,&#xD;
      thirst and hunger in the preoperative period, and providing patient comfort by reducing&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting and dehydration in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Managing food and fluid restriction in line with the guidelines in the preoperative period is&#xD;
      one of the important responsibilities of the surgical nurse. Thus, the comfort of the&#xD;
      patients will be increased, their anxiety will be reduced, and they will be able to return to&#xD;
      their normal lives as soon as possible. Working from here; It was aimed to determine the&#xD;
      effect of preoperative OCS on anxiety and patient comfort in patients undergoing HA.&#xD;
