  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia for cesarean section is associated with a high incidence of low blood&#xD;
      pressure. However, the pathophysiology of this arterial hypotension is not unequivocal and&#xD;
      could involve, in addition to drug vasoplegia, a mechanical cause linked to lower caval&#xD;
      compression or even true or relative hypovolemia. Passive leg raise test has been proposed in&#xD;
      an attempt to identify parturients who are more likely to develop low blood pressure after&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. Nevertheless, the data available on this volume expansion test to predict&#xD;
      hemodynamic variations after performing spinal anesthesia are still limited and few objective&#xD;
      criteria have been described to predict this arterial hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the research is to study the hypothesis according to which the presence of&#xD;
      hypovolaemia (true or relative) objectified by a positive passive leg raise test would cause&#xD;
      hypotension more frequent and more marked in intensity.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will have a clinical hemodynamic and echocardiographic evaluation, before performing&#xD;
      the spinal anesthesia, before and after the passive leg raise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the patients will benefit from a clinical hemodynamic evaluation during the preparation&#xD;
      of the parturient in the operating room and finally after the completion of the spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia and until the clamping of the umbilical cord.&#xD;

Each component has a number of grades starting with the most severe. The best ocular response has 4 grades; the best verbal response has 5 grades; the best motor response has 6 grades.&#xD;
Rating: the score of each component as well as the sum of the components are considered. The total score is out of 15 points; lower scores indicating more severe impairment. The lowest possible score is 3, indicating deep coma or death, and the highest possible score is 15, indicating a fully awake individual.</description>
