    <textblock>
      Background: Hyperglycemia is a risk factor to disease development, namely, diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      The blood glucose level management, particularly on post-prandial period has an important&#xD;
      role in the prevention of different diseases. Ginger is a specie that has been demonstrated a&#xD;
      benefit effect on glycaemia on diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study was 1) to investigate the effects of ginger infusion in the&#xD;
      glycaemic response in nondiabetic adults; 2) to evaluate total phenolic content the&#xD;
      antioxidant activity of Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) aqueous extracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: 24 nondiabetic subjects were randomly allocated into two groups: intervention&#xD;
      group (GI; n=15) and control group (GC; n=15). An oral glucose solution (OGTT) and an OGTT&#xD;
      following ginger extract solution were administrated in control and intervention groups,&#xD;
      respectively. Blood glucose levels were measurement at fasting and after 30, 60, 90 and 120&#xD;
      minutes after interventions in both groups. Total phenolic content and flavonoids compounds&#xD;
      determination of the aqueous ginger extract was determined according to Prabha method.&#xD;
      Antioxidant activity was also measured through ABTS method and free radicals inhibition&#xD;
      capacity. Repeated Measures ANOVA of mixed type and independent samples t-test were used in&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;

      This clinical trial was approved by Ethical Committee (process number 519 at 23 November&#xD;
      2016). All participants signed a written informed consent after aim and experimental risk&#xD;
      procedures explanation and its protected confidentiality was guaranteed. The experimental&#xD;
      procedure involving human was care out according Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This blind (to participants) randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at Egas Moniz&#xD;
      higher education school in 30 nondiabetic adults. Participants with ages between 18 and 40&#xD;
      were selected and randomly allocated in intervention group (IG) (n=15) and control group (CG)&#xD;
      (n=15), in which participants were alternated include in the groups. The IG performed an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) followed by aqueous ginger extract administration and the CG&#xD;
      performed an OGTT administration alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ginger extract preparation, powder ginger (Zingibre officinalle Roscoe) was obtained from&#xD;
      Portugal Company with India origin and stored in a dried environmental locally until needed.&#xD;
      The product has a batch number of LI1GIGRNT150012. Powder ginger was individually weight&#xD;
      (0.2g each dose) and added to 100mL of boiled water obtaining the ginger extract, infusing 10&#xD;
      minutes. Ginger extract solution was after cooled at room temperature and distributed to each&#xD;
      participant. This method was adapted by Wilkinson, J. M. (2000). For chemical analysis, a&#xD;
      aqueous ginger extract previously obtained was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding to blood glucose level assessment, the blood sample were collected for each&#xD;
      participant using a capillary drop blood before the intervention (fasting) and after 30, 60,&#xD;
      90 and 120 minutes. The blood glucose level analysis was performed using a strips for glucose&#xD;
      meter (Onetouch Select Plus Flex), a sterilized lancet and a glucose meter equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General characteristics data of the participants were collected, namely, anthropometrics&#xD;
      data, pharmacologic treatment and medical condition using a questionnaire. In addition, a&#xD;
      24-hour dietary recall at the day before the intervention was employing to sample&#xD;
      participants. The nutritional analyzed of diet ingested was performed by Food Processor SQL&#xD;
      (version 10.5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total phenolic compounds determination of the aqueous ginger extract was determined&#xD;
      according to Folin-Ciocalteu method. The total phenolic results were expressed as mg gallic&#xD;
      acid equivalent (GAE)/L of ginger extract. A volume of 125 μL of ginger extract and 2 mL of&#xD;
      sodium carbonate were added to 2.5 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. After 15 min the absorbance&#xD;
      was measured at 765 nm. The flavonoids compounds determination of the aqueous ginger extract&#xD;
      was determined according to Prabha method. The flavonoids results were expressed as mg&#xD;
      quercetin equivalent (GAE)/L of ginger extract. A volume of 2 mL of ginger extract were added&#xD;
      to 0.1 mL of aluminum chloride anhydrous solution (10%), 0.1 mL of potassium acetate (1M) and&#xD;
      2.8 mL of distilled water. After 30 min the absorbance was measured at 415 nm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antioxidant activity was measured through different assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superoxide anion radicals scavenging activity was determined based on Morais et al&#xD;
      method. Superoxide anion was generated by reacting phenazine methosulfate (PMS), nicotinamide&#xD;
      adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH), and oxygen causing reduced NBT in Formazan. A volume of&#xD;
      0.5mL of sample was added to 0.5mL of a solution containing NADH (189 microM) and NBT (120&#xD;
      microM) with Tris-HCl (40mM, pH = 8). The reaction started after the addition of 0.5mL of PMS&#xD;
      (60microM). Control sample was measured using only distilled water. After 5min of incubation,&#xD;
      control absorbance was measured at 560 nm at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nitric oxide inhibitory activity was determined according Khayami et al method. A volume&#xD;
      of 1mL of sodium nitroprusside 10nm was added to 250microL de phosphate buffered saline (PBS)&#xD;
      and 250microL of test solution and it was shaken. The previous solution was incubated for 150&#xD;
      min at 25ºC and following add 3mL of sulfanilic acid and 0.33% of acetic acid glacial. After&#xD;
      5 min at room temperature, it was add 3mL of n-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride&#xD;
      (NED, 0.1% m/v) and incubated for 30 min at 25ºC. The absorbance was measured at 533nm. The&#xD;
      previous procedure was employed to control obtained using water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The free radical 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was obtained&#xD;
      by ABTS oxidation with potassium persulfate 140mM for 12h in dark, according Zulueta et al&#xD;
      method. It was prepared a solution with 10mL ABTS 7nm and 176microL persulfate and storage at&#xD;
      room temperature by 12h in dark. The previous solution was diluted with ethanol until 0.7&#xD;
      absorbance at 734nm. A volume of 2850microL of ABTS radical was added to 150microL of sample&#xD;
      and to 150microL of water. After 30min in dark the absorbance was determined at 734nm. The&#xD;
      Trolox concentration was using as standard (mM Trolox/L). This test was performed for several&#xD;
      extract concentrations in order to calculate IC50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences) (version 22) software. Mean and standard error of the mean were used. Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      and Repeated Measures ANOVA of mixed type were used. Independent samples T-test was used to&#xD;
      assess the difference between the 2 groups for total caloric value, carbohydrates, protein&#xD;
      and lipid ingested, Cmax (maximum concentration), ΔCmax (variation of maximum concentration),&#xD;
      and AUC (area under the curve) Incremental values. The AUC was calculated by Software&#xD;
      GraphPad Prim (version 7.03). All statistical tests were performed at the 5% level of&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
