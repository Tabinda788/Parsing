  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to use a test called impedance cardiography (ICG) to&#xD;
      provide more information about how to improve the control of blood pressure. Participants&#xD;
      will be given this test so investigators can get more information about what is going on&#xD;
      inside the heart and blood vessels that is contributing to high blood pressure. ICG is a lot&#xD;
      like an EKG (electrocardiogram) in that it uses electrodes and a computer to make a report.&#xD;
      Participants will lie down on the exam table and two electrodes go on the right ankle and two&#xD;
      electrodes go on the left wrist. The process takes about 5 minutes and is painless and not&#xD;
      invasive.&#xD;
