      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Laura Mitchell's relaxation&#xD;
      training on primary dysmenorrhea and menstrual symptoms. The study will be carried out on&#xD;
      women who have been diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea, have a regular menstrual cycle (28±7&#xD;
      days), have menstrual pain higher than 4 cm according to the visual analog scale (VAS), and&#xD;
      wish to voluntarily participate in the study. The questionnaire created by the researchers&#xD;
      will be administered online. The women included in the study will be divided into 2 groups as&#xD;
      experimental and control groups by applying randomization using the random drawing method.&#xD;
      Laura Mitchell's physiological relaxation training will be applied to the experimental group&#xD;
      for 30 minutes on menstrual days during a total of 3 menstrual cycles, accompanied by an&#xD;
      online live lesson. The control group will continue their daily routine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological complaint in women of reproductive age, characterized&#xD;
      by lower abdominal pain that occurs a few hours before or with the onset of menstruation and&#xD;
      persists for 1-2 days. It is more common in adolescent and young women. It is divided into&#xD;
      primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. The prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea varies between&#xD;
      17-95% (Lee, Khalil, &amp; Lim, 2018; Uysal et al, 2016; Allen &amp; Lam, 2012). Primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea, unlike secondary dysmenorrhea, is due to contraction of the myometrium without&#xD;
      pelvic pathology. Pain occurs with every menstrual cycle. Generally, cramp-like pain in the&#xD;
      suprapubic region may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, sweating,&#xD;
      diarrhea, insomnia and syncope (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2019;&#xD;
      Kilici et al, 2019). While primary dysmenorrhea is more common in nulliparous, both its&#xD;
      severity and incidence decrease with increasing age and parity. Primary dysmenorrhea is&#xD;
      pelvic pain that is caused by the natural production of prostaglandins and is not associated&#xD;
      with pelvic pathology, and is among the common causes of admission to emergency services (Yu,&#xD;
      2014). In the pathogenesis of primary dysmenorrhea, it is thought to be associated with&#xD;
      prostaglandin production, which increases with vasoconstriction of the uterine blood vessels,&#xD;
      leading to uterine contractility and ischemia (Shundo et al, 2018; Iacovides et al, 2015).&#xD;
      Primary dysmenorrhea does not threaten the life of women, but it can affect the quality of&#xD;
      life negatively and prevent work and school continuity (Hailemeskel et al, 2016;&#xD;
      Motahari-Tabari, 2017). There are various relaxation techniques in the literature to reduce&#xD;
      the pain and improve the quality of life of women with primary dysmenorrhea. Relaxation&#xD;
      techniques are effective and easy-to-apply self-management therapy in reducing the effects of&#xD;
      pain, stress, depression, anxiety and mood changes on the individual and in controlling the&#xD;
      body (Emarloo &amp; Doutkam, 2015). Laura Mitchell's Simple Physiological Relaxation Training is&#xD;
      a standard method with the advantages of requiring less concentration, being learned in a&#xD;
      short time and showing a rapid effect, and is widely used especially in the field of&#xD;
      obstetrics and gynecology (DeMarce, 2014; Vaziri et al, 2017; Güvey, 2018; Doğan et al,&#xD;
      2019). It is known that this technique, which includes diaphragmatic breathing, improves&#xD;
      immune system functions and quality of life, and also reduces depression (Ganesh et al,&#xD;
      2017). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Laura Mitchell's relaxation&#xD;
      training on primary dysmenorrhea and menstrual symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD The study will be carried out on women who have been diagnosed with primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea, have a regular menstrual cycle (28±7 days), have menstrual pain higher than 4&#xD;
      cm according to the visual analog scale (VAS), and wish to voluntarily participate in the&#xD;
      study. The questionnaire created by the researchers will be administered online. Before&#xD;
      starting the study, the consent of the participants will be obtained via online link. The&#xD;
      women included in the study will be divided into 2 groups as experimental and control groups&#xD;
      by applying randomization using the random drawing method. Data collection Evaluations were&#xD;
      evaluated according to the physical (age, height, body weight, body mass index) and&#xD;
      demographic data of the individuals (age at menarche, mean cycle duration, duration of&#xD;
      menstruation, pain status, duration of pain, number of pads used on the busiest day, presence&#xD;
      of menstrual symptoms experienced during menstruation period). intensity) will be recorded.&#xD;
      Individuals will be examined for 5 menstrual cycle follow-ups, 4 of which are consecutive.&#xD;
      Pain intensity of individuals will be evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and menstrual&#xD;
      symptoms will be evaluated with Menstrual Symptom Scale (MSS). To the individuals&#xD;
      participating in our study; The 1st day of the 1st menstruation is the 1st evaluation, and&#xD;
      the data will be collected with VAS and MSÖ for both groups, and relaxation training will&#xD;
      begin for the experimental group. The 1st day of the 2nd menstruation is the 2nd evaluation,&#xD;
      and the data will be collected with VAS and MSÖ for both groups, and relaxation training will&#xD;
      be continued for the experimental group. The 1st day of the 3rd menstruation will be the 3rd&#xD;
      evaluation. Data will be collected with VAS and MSÖ for both groups, and relaxation training&#xD;
      will be continued for the experimental group. The 1st day of the 4th menstruation will be the&#xD;
      4th evaluation, and the data will be collected with VAS and MSÖ for both groups, and the&#xD;
      relaxation training will be terminated for the experimental group. They will be free to&#xD;
      continue exercising until the seventh menstruation. 1st day of 7th menstruation&#xD;
