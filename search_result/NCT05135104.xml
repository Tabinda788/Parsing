      PALBO is a Non-Interventional, Single-Institution Study Of Real-World Evidence In Estrogen&#xD;
      Receptor Positive, Her2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Palbociclib&#xD;
      During A 2.5 Years Follow-Up Period. The primary objective is to identify pathological and&#xD;
      clinical features of MBC that is associated with Palbociclib's best efficacy, measured by&#xD;
      response rate (overall response rate, duration of response and best clinical response),&#xD;
      progression free survival and OS. Safety of Palbociclib will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is the most advanced stage of breast cancer, where the disease&#xD;
      has spread to distant sites beyond the axillary lymph nodes. At European level, MBC occurs in&#xD;
      up to 20-30 percent of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. At regional level,&#xD;
      there are variations in newly diagnosed patients who present with metastatic disease. In high&#xD;
      income countries fewer than 8% of patients are initially diagnosed with MBC, while the&#xD;
      highest burden of MBC is carried by low and middle-income countries where up to 60% are&#xD;
      initially diagnosed with MBC. Currently, the median overall survival for patients with MBC is&#xD;
      approximately 2 to 3 years in developed countries, but lower in developing countries. In&#xD;
      Romania, 8900 new cases of BC are diagnosed every year, with 80% being diagnosed in an&#xD;
      advance stage of the disease (II, III, IV). Furthermore, after initial BC treatment,&#xD;
      approximately 50% will develop MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors (Palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib) are&#xD;
      now standard of care for the treatment of advanced hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2&#xD;
      negative (HER2-) breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 09 November 2016, the EC has approved IBRANCE® (Palbociclib) as the first CDK 4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor, to be used in combination with letrozol as first-line or in combination with&#xD;
      fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy, based on the results of&#xD;
      PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3 study results. Other phase III randomized trials have been&#xD;
      reported and confirmed the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibition in both first-line and endocrine&#xD;
      resistant settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib®, an orally active pyridopyrimidine, is a potent and highly selective reversible&#xD;
      inhibitor of CDK 4 and CDK6. The compound prevents cellular DNA synthesis by prohibiting&#xD;
      progression of the cell cycle from G1 into the S phase. Specifically, Palbociclib inhibits&#xD;
      CDK4/6-catalyzed phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which is required for&#xD;
      cell division.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib® has selectivity for CDK4/6, with little or no activity against a large panel of&#xD;
      274 other protein kinases including other CDKs and a wide variety of tyrosine and&#xD;
      serine/threonine kinases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An approximate number of 150 patients will be included in the present study which will take&#xD;
      place in a research centre in Romania.&#xD;
