  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the treatment of Low Level Light Therapy(LLLT)&#xD;
      mitigate possible insomnia and psychological symptoms, when nurses have taken shifts.The&#xD;
      investigators hope that the goal of this interventional research is to improve sleep quality&#xD;
      and psychological symptoms of shift nurses in order to promote health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Low-Level Light Therapy; LLLT is also called PhotoBioModulation; PBM, which is a new type of&#xD;
      interventional therapy.LLLT applies low-level lasers or light-emitting diodes(LEDs) to the&#xD;
      human body for treatment. The wavelength of irradiated light is between red light(630-700 nm)&#xD;
      and near-infrared light(700nm-1,100nm), and leads to a positive biological effect. It is a&#xD;
      safe, painless, non-invasive treatment method. When LLLT is applied to the brain, it can pass&#xD;
      through the scalp, head bone and reach the brain, and then stimulating the photochemical&#xD;
      reaction in the cells, This is called transcranial Low-Level Laser Therapy (t-LLLT) or&#xD;
      transcranial Photobiomodulation(t-PBM). tLLLT has existed since 1967, and more than thousands&#xD;
      of scientific studies have shown that photons can stimulate biological responses and promote&#xD;
      the normal work of cells. t-LLLT can treat a variety of diseases, such as emotional symptoms,&#xD;
      lower back pain, weight loss, skin anti-aging, wound healing, etc. There are no reports of&#xD;
      side effects. The main mechanism is similar to the photosynthesis of plants. It absorbs light&#xD;
      and produces chemical reactions, supports mitochondrial function, and significantly increases&#xD;
      the production of ATP(the main carrier of energy in cells.)in the brain, so as to function&#xD;
      work better and achieve self-repair. This research uses Dr. Tai's energy cap, the&#xD;
      manufacturer is Topunion Globaltek Inc., which passed the certification of the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health and Welfare(MOHW) for medical device in 2019. It has been modified to the second&#xD;
      generation and is now on the market. It basically provides two kinds of red light (wavelength&#xD;
      of 660nm) and near-infrared light(wavelength of 850nm), which is mainly used at home. The&#xD;
      research intervention will be conducted for four weeks, pre-tests and post-tests will be&#xD;
      conducted as indicators to evaluating sleep and psychological symptoms.&#xD;
