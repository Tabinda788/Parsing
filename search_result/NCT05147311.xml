  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to determine if a positive psychology-based&#xD;
      program in people who have received a stem cell transplant for blood cancer treatment is&#xD;
      feasible and acceptable, and can help improve positive feelings, mood, quality of life,&#xD;
      overall wellbeing and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Positive psychology for Allogenic Transplantation of Hematopoietic stem cell intervention&#xD;
      (PATH), a novel 9-week phone-administered Positive psychological intervention (PPI).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low levels of positive psychological well-being (PPWB) (e.g., optimism, positive affect) in&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are common and have been&#xD;
      associated with decreased quality of life, poorer immune response, and increased mortality.&#xD;
      These poor health outcomes are likely mediated through deficits in health behaviors (e.g.,&#xD;
      medication adherence, physical activity), and indeed low PPWB has been prospectively&#xD;
      associated with poorer adherence to diet, medication, and physical activity in other medical&#xD;
      populations, independent of sociodemographic, medical comorbidity, and the ill effects of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety. Positive psychological intervention s (PPIs) could be used to promote&#xD;
      PPWB in the allogeneic transplant population. Despite the successful and effective use of&#xD;
      PPIs in medical populations to reduce distress, increase quality of life, and promote health&#xD;
      behaviors, PPI have never been tested in allogeneic recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This a single center randomized trial of the PATH intervention versus usual care in patients&#xD;
      with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomized equally to the two arms using randomized permuted blocks&#xD;
           of sizes two and four, with randomization stratified by presence/absence of GVHD. As&#xD;
           allogeneic transplant recipients with GVHD have significantly different courses of&#xD;
           recovery, QOL, and function post transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant will be randomized into either: The Positive psychology for Allogenic&#xD;
                Transplantation of Hematopoietic stem cell intervention (PATH), a novel 9-week&#xD;
                phone-administered Positive psychological intervention (PPI) or usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 70 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
