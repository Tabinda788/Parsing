  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A consensus study using nominal group technique is planned to develop recommendations for a&#xD;
      comfort intervention package for radiotherapy with patients and therapeutic radiographers.&#xD;
      This includes completed work from a systematic literature review (Prospero 59688) of comfort&#xD;
      interventions applicable to radiotherapy and qualitative interviews (NCT03984435) with&#xD;
      patients and therapeutic radiographers exploring comfort management in radiotherapy.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop a radiotherapy comfort intervention package with patients&#xD;
      and therapeutic radiographers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 - Identify and prioritise intervention components for inclusion in&#xD;
      recommendations for a radiotherapy comfort intervention package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 - Determine the feasibility of delivering the component of the radiotherapy&#xD;
      comfort intervention package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified nominal group technique (NGT) will employed to develop recommendations for a comfort&#xD;
      intervention package in radiotherapy in a consensus study with patients and therapeutic&#xD;
      radiographers. This study follows earlier phases of the COMFORT study which included a&#xD;
      systematic literature review of comfort interventions applicable to radiotherapy and&#xD;
      qualitative interviews exploring comfort management in radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are: 1) diagnosed with a malignancy; 2) aged over 18 years owing to&#xD;
      different treatment options for children and young adults; 3) recently referred for&#xD;
      radiotherapy, currently receiving treatment or had had radiotherapy within the previous 3&#xD;
      months; 4) treatment delivery time exceeding 10 minutes (the time the patient is immobilised&#xD;
      on the radiotherapy couch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic radiographers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are: 1) practicing radiographers; 2) administering radiotherapy with&#xD;
      treatment delivery times exceeding 10 minutes per radiotherapy treatment session (the time&#xD;
      the patient is immobilised on the radiotherapy couch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consensus study will be conducted by video conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Size of Sample (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-12 participants (4-9 Patients and 2-3 Therapeutic radiographers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up duration (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up is not planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Study Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question/Aim(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop recommendations for a radiotherapy comfort intervention&#xD;
      with patients and therapeutic radiographers.&#xD;
