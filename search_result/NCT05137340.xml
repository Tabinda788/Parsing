      BACKGROUND Treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome(NRDS) with exogenous&#xD;
      surfactant and mechanical ventilation made millions of preterm infants survived in neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU). Endotracheal intubation surfactant administration is related to&#xD;
      invasive intubation and short periods of positive pressure ventilation and implies the risk&#xD;
      of lung injury.Recent studies have shown that minimally invasive surfactant&#xD;
      administration(MISA) has more advantages than endotracheal intubation in premature infants&#xD;
      with NRDS with spontaneous breathing (especially those with gestational age less than 30&#xD;
      weeks). It can reduce the time of invasive mechanical ventilation and reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia.The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of MISA in&#xD;
      the treatment of NRDS in premature infants under the initial respiratory support mode of&#xD;
      nasal continuous positive airway pressure(NCPAP) and Non-invasive positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (NIPPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study was a multicenter, randomized, clinical,&#xD;
      parallel-group study conducted between December 1st, 2021, and August 30,2023, in 16 level&#xD;
      III neonatal intensive care units in China.Participants enrolled spontaneously breathing&#xD;
      preterm infants born between 24 and 29.9 weeks' gestational age with signs of respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome. After transfer to NICU ward, infants were randomly assigned to NCPAP group&#xD;
      and NIPPV group.Patients diagnosed with NRDS on non-invasive respiratory support (NIPPV or&#xD;
      NCPAP) were given a therapeutic dose of pulmonary surfactant via MISA within 120 minutes&#xD;
      after birth.&#xD;

      NCPAP group ventilator parameter setting: PEEP 6cmH2O (adjustment range 6-8cmH2O), FiO2&#xD;
      adjustment range 0.21-0.40, in order to achieve postnatal target oxygen saturation. The&#xD;
      initial ventilator parameters of NIPPV group were as follows: PEEP 6cmH2O (adjustment range&#xD;
      6-8cmH2O), PIP15cmH2O (regulation range 15-20cmH2O), inspiratory time 0.3s (regulation range&#xD;
      0.3-0.4s), respiratory rate 30 beats/min (regulation range 20-40 beats/min), and FiO2&#xD;
      regulation range 0.21-0.40 in order to achieve postnatal target oxygen saturation.&#xD;
