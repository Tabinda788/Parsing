  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of colonic polyps. However, it was&#xD;
      reported that colonoscopy could still miss colonic polyps. Many attempts have been made to&#xD;
      improve the detection rate of colonoscopy. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising new&#xD;
      technique in reduction of missing rate of colonic adenoma. However, it remains uncertain&#xD;
      whether combination of Endocuff and AI can further reduce the missing rate. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is to compare Endocuff with AI, AI and conventional colonoscopy on adenoma&#xD;
      miss rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective randomised tandem colonoscopy trial comparing three different modes of&#xD;
      colonoscopy techniques. Three groups will use different modes for first colonoscopy and&#xD;
      follow by high-definition white light colonoscopy on second examination. The first group will&#xD;
      use Endocuff (Olympus, Hong Kong) and AI assisted colonoscopy for first colonoscopy. The&#xD;
      second group will use AI assisted colonoscopy alone for first examination whereas the third&#xD;
      group will use high-definition white light colonoscopy for first examination. Second tandem&#xD;
      examination of all three groups will be performed under high-definition white light&#xD;
      colonoscopy without AI or Endocuff-assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to three groups. Patients will&#xD;
      be stratified according to indications of colonoscopy (symptomatic vs&#xD;
      screening/surveillance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All examination will be performed with high-definition endoscopes (EVIS-EXERA 290 video&#xD;
      system, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) under white light by experienced endoscopists. All&#xD;
      endoscopists should have received training on the interpretation of real-time AI detection&#xD;
      system as well as the Endocuff before performing study colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all colonoscopy examination, colonoscope will be first advanced to the cecum as confirmed&#xD;
      by identification of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve or by intubation of the&#xD;
      ileum. After cecal intubation is performed, the colonoscopy is first withdrawn according to&#xD;
      the group assigned. For group 1, the first withdrawal would be done with Endocuff and AI&#xD;
      assistance. For group 2, the first withdrawal would be done under AI assistance only. For&#xD;
      group 3, the first withdrawal would be done under standard high definition colonoscopy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All detected polyps will be removed during the first examination. The size (measured with&#xD;
      biopsy forceps), location and morphology of each polyp will be recorded by an independent&#xD;
      observer. The withdrawal time of the first pass to the rectum (minus the polypectomy site)&#xD;
      will be measured by a stopwatch and with a minimum of 6 minutes. The bowel preparation&#xD;
      quality will be graded according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the first pass examination, the colonoscopy will be reintroduced to the&#xD;
      cecum and withdrawn with standard high definition colonoscopy. A second examination of the&#xD;
      colon will be performed by the same colonoscopy. Any polyp detected on second pass&#xD;
      examination will also be removed and the withdrawal time will also be documented.&#xD;
