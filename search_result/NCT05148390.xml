    <textblock>
      This is a post - market study with a wound dressing, a CE-marked medical device available on&#xD;
      the european market. The device will be used in routine clinical practice, i.e. within its&#xD;
      intended purpose and without any additional invasive or stressing examinations for the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 36 adult patients with wounds suitable to be treated with the medical device and&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled at two participating German sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 5 on-site visits within 28 days routine weekly dressing changes the Health Care&#xD;
      Professional will examine the wound and will perform required wound care and dressing&#xD;
      changes. Pictures of the wound with and without dressing will be taken at each visit and used&#xD;
      for automatic analysis. The subjects will be asked to rate their general wound pain and the&#xD;
      pain perceived during dressing changes. A wound-related quality of life questionnaire will be&#xD;
      presented to the subjects twice and the subject and HCP will rate their safisfaction with the&#xD;
      product.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Post Market Clinical Follow up (PMCF) study will examine product features of the&#xD;
      CE-marked wound dressing after having received market authorization regarding the fulfilment&#xD;
      of predefined requirements for the successful management of skin integrity during wound care.&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical safety and performance of the&#xD;
      product when used on several wounds in routine wound care without any additional invasive or&#xD;
      burdensome methods and within the intended use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary objective the dressing´s absorption performance and its ability to prevent exudate&#xD;
      accumulation in the wound will be investigated. Further, device disintegration, need of&#xD;
      debridement, wound and skin conditions, treatment related pain, general wound pain, dressing&#xD;
      adhesion and quality of life as well as Helath Care professional's (HCP´s) and patient´s&#xD;
      satisfaction are considered as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 36 eligible subjects will be enrolled at 2 German sites, including 15 % dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 on-site visits are to be performed by the subjects in the scope of routine weekly wound&#xD;
      care/dressing change visits during 28 days (Day 0, Day7, Day 14, Day21, Day28). The IMD will&#xD;
      be applied during each on-site visit including wound care, wound examination/documentation&#xD;
      and dressing change according to HCP's judgment and individual circumstances of the wound.&#xD;
      Photographic documentation of the wound and the wound with applied dressings will be&#xD;
      performed and used for further automatic wound/tissue analyis. General wound pain as well as&#xD;
      pain perceived during dressing change will be documented, as well as Wound-related Quality of&#xD;
      life as well as Patient's/HCP's satisfaction with the product.&#xD;

        Representativeness of the investigation population is assumed to be high in relation to the&#xD;
        target population since this is a PMCF study, where the IMD will be used within the&#xD;
        intended purpose including the intended patient population. Therefore, the IMD will be&#xD;
        tested by the population for whom it is in fact intended for once placed on the market&#xD;
        among other intended users. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are aligned with the product´s&#xD;
        intended purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No vulnerable subjects such as children, pregnant women, or sponsors or manufacturers staff&#xD;
        will participate in this study guaranteed by specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
