  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease is one of the most common genetic diseases in the United States,&#xD;
      occurring in approximately 1 in 400 births. Approximately 100,000 individuals are diagnosed&#xD;
      with SCD in the United States. Mortality for children with SCD has decreased substantially&#xD;
      over the past 4 decades, with &gt;99% of those born in high resource settings, including the&#xD;
      United States, France, and England, now surviving to 18 years of age. However, the life&#xD;
      expectancy of adults with SCD is severely shortened. Dysfunction of the heart, lung, and&#xD;
      kidney is directly associated with decreased life expectancy. With the variety of curative&#xD;
      therapies that are now available for SCD, long-term health outcomes studies are&#xD;
      time-sensitive. As of now, efforts to determine long-term health outcomes following curative&#xD;
      therapies for SCD have been limited. Though curative therapies initially should provide a&#xD;
      cure for symptoms of SCD, there is the risk of late health outcomes to consider. Defining&#xD;
      health outcomes following curative therapy is essential to improve personalized&#xD;
      decision-making when considering curative versus disease-modifying therapeutic options. The&#xD;
      primary goal of this study is to determine whether curative therapies for individuals with&#xD;
      SCD will result in improved or worsening heart, lung, and kidney damage when compared to&#xD;
      individuals with SCD receiving standard therapy. The investigators will also explore whether&#xD;
      certain genes are associated with a good or bad outcome after curative therapy for SCD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is initiating a personalized approach to curative therapies in children&#xD;
      and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) to maximize benefits and limit adverse outcomes.&#xD;
      Limited clinical studies exist to determine the long-term health outcomes following curative&#xD;
      therapies for SCD. With emerging curative therapies for SCD (allogeneic [allo] hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant [HSCT], gene therapy/editing), long-term health outcomes studies are&#xD;
      critical to inform personalized choices. Unfortunately, adverse outcomes have started to&#xD;
      emerge after SCD curative therapy. Thus, risks of a cure in SCD must be measured against the&#xD;
      benefits of a cure, including stabilization of lung function (FEV1) and improved tricuspid&#xD;
      regurgitant jet velocity [TRJV]. Ultimately, the shortened lifespan of individuals with SCD,&#xD;
      attributable to declining heart (elevated TRJV), lung (decreased FEV1), and kidney (decreased&#xD;
      eGFR) function, for which curative therapies were designed to ameliorate, must be measured&#xD;
      against favorable and unfavorable late outcomes. In our multicenter retrospective-prospective&#xD;
      cohort, the investigators will test the following hypotheses: 1a): myeloablative curative&#xD;
      therapies for children with SCD will result in progressive pulmonary and renal dysfunction&#xD;
      when compared to children with SCD receiving standard therapy; 1b): nonmyeloablative HSCT for&#xD;
      adults with SCD will result in no significant change in FEV1% predicted, but will lead to&#xD;
      accelerated decline in eGFR when compared to adults receiving standard therapy; 2)&#xD;
      nonmyeloablative HSCT for adults with SCD will be associated with a clinically significant&#xD;
      improvement in TRJV following HSCT; and 3) in adults with SCD, proliferative and genotoxic&#xD;
      stress uniformly related to nonmyeloablative allo-HSCT and myeloablative gene editing will&#xD;
      lead to post-HSCT therapy-related myeloid neoplasm of recipient origin. The investigators&#xD;
      will address these hypotheses with the following aims: 1) evaluate the incidence of pulmonary&#xD;
      and renal function in 1a: children with SCD receiving myeloablative curative therapies; and&#xD;
      1b: adults with SCD receiving nonmyeloablative allo-HSCT, compared to a pre-existing cohort&#xD;
      of children and adults with SCD; 2) determine whether there is a clinically significant&#xD;
      improvement in TRJV in adults with SCD, at least half having TRJV &gt; 2.5 m/s, following&#xD;
      nonmyeloablative allo-HSCT, 3) evaluate the prevalence, incidence and evolution of Clonal&#xD;
      hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) concerning therapy-related myeloid neoplasm&#xD;
      development following non-myeloablative HSCT or myeloablative gene editing in adults and&#xD;
      children with SCD, and 4) evaluate accuracy and gaps involved in collecting clinical health&#xD;
      record data directly from patients and family members in comparison to clinical health record&#xD;
      data collected by research coordinators.&#xD;
