      Brief Summary .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment aims to use two different teaching methods to intervene in students' learning&#xD;
      and find out which teaching method is more conducive to improving students' written test&#xD;
      achievement. The experiment will use a 6-the investigator seek workshop intervention to&#xD;
      enhance students' written test achievement. The investigation is divided into workshop groups&#xD;
      and standard teaching groups. The most significant difference better investigators the two&#xD;
      groups are that the workshop group has oral links and guarantees. The similarities between&#xD;
      investigators in the two groups are teacher qualifications, intervention time, content, and&#xD;
      research objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on content knowledge learning, content knowledge is divided into six categories for&#xD;
      detailed intervention. First, the investigators will do a 6-the investigator seek&#xD;
      intervention for two groups (workshop style and standard teaching style). The difference&#xD;
      better investigators two is whether there is a video teaching link, and the same is that&#xD;
      there are oral links. The entire experiment was carried out in the classroom with the&#xD;
      school's consent. Use written exams to check student scores. Students have special teachers&#xD;
      responsible for teaching specific content knowledge during class, standard learning after&#xD;
      class does not require special care, and the experiment is not risky.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis including as follow:1 ) General Hypothesis. There is no significant difference in&#xD;
      the written test results of the prior theoretical knowledge 、health promotion knowledge、&#xD;
      physical exercise knowledge control group, with experimental group performance among PE&#xD;
      students in China. 2) Specific Hypothesis. The specific hypothesis of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of a 6-weeks content knowledge workshop on written test performance&#xD;
      among PE students in China. The detailed hypothesis is: There is no significant difference&#xD;
      between the control and experimental groups in the sports training design、the teaching design&#xD;
      、the muscle function system、the exercise physiology、the competition venue planning、the&#xD;
      referee rules written test performance among PE students in China.&#xD;

      Detailed Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location.The University of China. In terms of students, the proportion of people who choose&#xD;
      to work is high, while the proportion of people who choose to continue their postgraduate&#xD;
      entrance tests is negligible. Sports graduates account for 70% of a Province, and students&#xD;
      have not participated in workshop study. On the school side, the school has perfect teaching&#xD;
      equipment to meet the experimental requirements, conducive to better completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of intervention Plan-same characteristics mainly includes two parts: Teacher&#xD;
      qualification and student qualifications. In the first part, workshop group and standard&#xD;
      teaching group, teacher Qualification, same qualification and titles, both have one same&#xD;
      teacher majors: physical education, similar experience: minimum more than ten years.No&#xD;
      students have received this courses before the study. The second part is the age, major and&#xD;
      educational background of students. For example, students with similar educational&#xD;
      backgrounds, aged 19 and 25, are all majors in physical education.No students have received&#xD;
      these courses before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part discusses the details of the 6-the investigator seeks workshop and standard&#xD;
      teaching intervention. First and foremost, CK includes three categories. Then, the deeper&#xD;
      level is divided into six parts: methods and plans, class hour teaching plan, muscle&#xD;
      exercise, energy supply, breathing and exercise circulation and exercise, athletic and&#xD;
      basketball venue, basketball, and football rules. On the other hand, there are two lessons;&#xD;
      each class is 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a one-class training plan, mainly divided into other structures. A training session&#xD;
      explicitly includes three parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To start with, the intervention content includes step 1-An, an overview, and introduction,&#xD;
      step 2-Students formed groups, step 3-Oral test assessment. The first part includes: The&#xD;
      teacher introduced the purpose of the study, expectations, and discussion of the principles&#xD;
      of sports training design. Next, the investigators learn to design, muscle function, and&#xD;
      exercise physiology system-rest time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part includes introducing the purpose of the study, expectations, and discussion&#xD;
      of the principles of sports training design. They the investigators learn content related to&#xD;
      design and muscle function and exercise physiology systems. Rest time Divided into three&#xD;
      groups and rotated roles of teacher, students, 8 / group. They the investigators learn by the&#xD;
      reciprocal peer learning instructional model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third part includes introducing the purpose of the study, expectations, and discussion of&#xD;
      the principles of sports training design. They the investigators learn content related to&#xD;
      design and muscle function and exercise physiology systems. Rest time Divided into three&#xD;
      groups and rotated roles of teacher, students, 8 / group. They the investigators learn by the&#xD;
      reciprocal peer learning instructional model. Students the investigators prompted to switch&#xD;
      teacher roles, student every 10 min-evaluation through check sheets and oral test ( 90% or&#xD;
      better correct and the investigators ).&#xD;
