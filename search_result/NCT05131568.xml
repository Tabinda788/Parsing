  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of a new layered thermal insulation system (SIT-3c)&#xD;
      versus the traditional thermal body protection (warmed forced air system) for patients under&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty, during the intra-operative phase.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protecting patients from the cold in the operating room is a complex problem that has&#xD;
      encouraged the search for better and more effective thermal protection systems. Some&#xD;
      disadvantages have been observed in the daily use of the recommended thermal protection&#xD;
      system (forced warm air).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a three-layer thermal&#xD;
      insulation system, comparing its effect with the forced warm air system on temperature&#xD;
      variation, shivering incidence and comfort perception, in patients undergoing total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty under neuro-axial anesthesia, during the intra-operative phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) or control group (CG). The&#xD;
      experimental group receives as a skin protection the three-layer thermal insulation system&#xD;
      (SIT-3c) and the control group receives the usual recommended system (forced warm air).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both systems are placed at the entrance to the operating room and held on patients during the&#xD;
      entire intra-operative phase.&#xD;

    <description>experimental: layered thermal insulation system&#xD;
The system was applied in the upper body to the entrance of the operating room and remained until the exit of the same room.&#xD;
The test included the evaluation of temperature, tremors and the visual perception of thermal comfort in 6 moments (T1 - reference temperature - at the entrance of the anesthetic induction room, T2 - at the entrance to the operating room, T3, T4 and T5 - fifteen , thirty and forty-five minutes after the start of surgery, and T6 - leaving the operating room)</description>
