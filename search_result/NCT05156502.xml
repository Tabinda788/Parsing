  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) occurs in approximately 50% of menopausal women but&#xD;
      is both underrecognized and undertreated despite numerous treatment options. Vaginal dryness,&#xD;
      irritation, dyspareunia, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency are some of the more common&#xD;
      symptoms that can have a negative effect on women's lives and relationships. In particular,&#xD;
      dyspareunia is localized in the vestibule with specific trophic changes more evident than&#xD;
      those localized in vagina. The CO2 fractionated laser, has also been found to be useful in&#xD;
      several studies for the treatment of vaginal atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open comparative study, 70 female menopausal subjects aged between 40 and 70 years&#xD;
      old at inclusion, having symptoms of GSM (Vaginal dryness, burning/pain,&#xD;
      dyspareunia,dysuria), have given her informed consent and meet all the eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      will be enrolled. The two groups of comparison will be 35 subjects treated into vagina and&#xD;
      vestibule, versus 35 subjects treated into vagina, only. Subjects will come to a total of 6&#xD;
      visits over a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the performance and safety of Pixel&#xD;
      CO2-Alma Fractionated Laser comparing its administration into vagina and vestibule versus&#xD;
      into vagina, only. The evaluated outcomes are vaginal dryness, burning/pain, dyspareunia,&#xD;
      sensitivity to touch at Swab test, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Vulval Pain&#xD;
      Functional Questionnaire (VQ) at day 84 and 120 and the safety during all the study. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are the evaluation of vaginal and vestibular trophism, measured by&#xD;
      Vaginal Health Index (VHI) and Vestibular Health Score (VHS) at the FU visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Sexual Function by Female Sexual Function Index</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual function will be evaluated at baseline and after 84 and 120 days by the Italian validated translation of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), a self-report instrument consisting of 19 items that assess sexual function over the past 4 weeks in six areas: sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Mean value in each group separately and in the two groups in comparison will be analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Vulval Pain by Vulval Pain Functional Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Vulval Pain Functional Questionnaire (VQ) will be used to quantify the extent that pelvic pain is affecting the patients. A numerical value is assigned to each response. The higher the score the greater the functional limitation. A diminishing score represents improvement.</description>

    <measure>Vestibular Trophism by Vaginal Health Index</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The changing from baseline to day 84 (visit 5) and 120 (final visit) for Vaginal Health Index (VHI) mean value in each group separately and the changing in Arm A in comparison with that occurred in Arm B. The VHI score evaluates 5 parameters (vaginal elasticity, vaginal secretions, vaginal pH, epithelial mucous membrane, vaginal hydration) and to obtain a final score defining the degree of atrophy in the genitourinary tract by assigning a single score to each parameter. The minim score is 5 and the maxim is 25.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vestibular Trophism by Vestibular Health Score</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>Vestibular Health Score (VHS) will be used by the Investigator evaluating 5 parameters (Petechiae, Pallor, Fragility, dryness, Erythema) and to obtain a final score defining the degree of atrophy. Each item is scored on a Likert scale between 0 =absent and 3 =severe. Total scores range from 0 to 15.</description>
