      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of seven different formulations&#xD;
      currently marketed and commercially available cosmetic products on skin tone evenness,&#xD;
      post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and discrete pigmentation in females of Fitzpatrick skin&#xD;
      types IV-VI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, double-blind randomized, split face, efficacy study. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive a cleanser, Day Cream/sunscreen, and two treatment products. The treatment products&#xD;
      will be applied in a split face fashion including behind the ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local volunteer subjects will be enrolled such that a total of eighty-four (84) subjects will&#xD;
      complete the study; with 24 subjects completing in each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a cleanser, Day Cream/sunscreen and two treatment products as per&#xD;
      the randomization. Subjects will use the cleanser twice daily, Day Cream/sunscreen in the&#xD;
      morning, and the treatment products as specified after cleansing in the evening, for a period&#xD;
      of 16 weeks. Clinical assessments, non-invasive instrument measurements and photographs will&#xD;
      be completed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. Biopsies will be taken at baseline and&#xD;
      Week 16.&#xD;
