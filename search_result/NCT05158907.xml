  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over a million new cancer cases are diagnosed in India each year. This huge burden coupled&#xD;
      with inadequate infrastructural facilities is adversely affecting the quality of patient&#xD;
      care. As a side effect it is adding to cost of health care which patient is paying from&#xD;
      his/her own pocket. Total care of cancer patients taking chemotherapy is interrupted by&#xD;
      several obstacles some of which can be prevented or detected early and treated. Most of the&#xD;
      patients experience toxicity during cancer chemotherapy but the reporting remains inadequate&#xD;
      as patients are not aware how to report or the physicians, many a times, are extremely busy&#xD;
      to record and act on them early. We assume that using patient reported adverse event (AE)&#xD;
      scale is more practical and easier to use for reporting AEs. This intervention, we feel, can&#xD;
      pick more AEs which can lead to early intervention by the physician and ultimately reducing&#xD;
      the cost of treatment to patients. We plan to include adult patients (&gt;18years) having&#xD;
      Gastro-intestinal cancers (both colorectal and non-colorectal cancers) who are scheduled to&#xD;
      receive combination chemotherapy medicines with both curative and non-curative intent (in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancers). Patients will be given an AE scale and will be asked to fill&#xD;
      it at home during each chemotherapy cycle, for upto 4 cycles. The physician will also ask&#xD;
      them about the AE during the next clinic visit and record the AEs as per the widely accepted&#xD;
      AE scale (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-CTCAE) for reporting. The patient&#xD;
      reported AE scale will then be compared and analyzed with standard CTCAE using relevant&#xD;
      statistical methods.&#xD;

      Population and setting: This study will be conducted at Tata Medical Center (TMC), Kolkata.&#xD;
      Patients in TMC are managed using evidence-based treatment protocols and through&#xD;
      multidisciplinary teams. Patients in this study will be drawn from those attending the cancer&#xD;
      clinics. Adult patients (&gt;18years age) receiving combination anti-cancer chemotherapy for&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal cancers (colorectal and non-colorectal) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: This is a single centre prospective study. Patients who provide written consent&#xD;
      for the study will be enrolled. Most commonly used standard combination chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      used in our clinic will be taken in this study i.e., weekly (e.g., Paclitaxel-Carboplatin,&#xD;
      Gemcitabine-Cisplatin), biweekly (e.g. FOLFOX/FOLFIRI/ FOLFOXIRI/FLOT/DCF/GEMOX), once every&#xD;
      three weeks (e.g. Capox/CapIri/mDCF) or once every 4 weeks (e.g.&#xD;
      ETOCIS/Capecitabine-Temozolomide) with or without Targeted therapy (e.g.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab/Cetuximab/Panitumumab) and/or Immunotherapy (e.g. Pembrolizumab/&#xD;
      Nivolumab/Atezolizumab/Ipilimumab). No single agent chemotherapy will be considered. Patients&#xD;
      will be stratified to type of combination chemotherapy with high and low probability of&#xD;
      causing severe toxicities. This will be based on our experience in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy combinations with high probability are FOLFOXIRI, FLOT, Capiri (Xeliri), mDCF&#xD;
      and with low probability are FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, GEMOX, Gemcitabine-Cisplatin,&#xD;
      Paclitaxel-Carboplatin, CapOx, ETOCIS, Capecitabine-Temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Consenting patients will be given a patient reported AE (PRAE) scale with&#xD;
      numbers from 0 (Nil) to 10 (most severe) before start of each chemotherapy cycle. This AE&#xD;
      scale will have pre-defined symptom related AEs with the provision of adding some more by the&#xD;
      patient if they have those symptoms. The PRAE scale will be like a Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
      (VAS) and the patients will be given instructions how to record AEs that they experience&#xD;
      after each chemotherapy cycle, until the first radiological assessment is done (palliative&#xD;
      settings) or after 4 cycles of chemotherapy in adjuvant settings. They will be asked to take&#xD;
      the scale home to record the adverse effects and give it a number (as per VAS), depending on&#xD;
      the severity. They will be told to record all the AEs (whenever they experience), even if&#xD;
      same AE happens more than once during a particular chemotherapy. Only the most severe one&#xD;
      will be analysed. When patient reports for the next cycle of chemotherapy he/she will be&#xD;
      asked to deposit the PRAE scale with the study co-ordinator before meeting the treating&#xD;
      physician and a new copy of a blank scale will be given to him/her for the next cycle. In the&#xD;
      clinic, as a standard practice, the doctor will ask the patient about the AEs experienced&#xD;
      with the previous chemotherapy and record them as per the CTCAE, grade, version 5. The&#xD;
      clinician will not get the opportunity to see the patient reported scale until the end of&#xD;
      patient's participation in the study. All the study participants, at the start of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and before each chemotherapy cycle, will be informed, as a standard practice, to&#xD;
      report to the emergency or contact nearest local clinic/hospital if the AE is severe or can't&#xD;
      be managed at home. The response by patients will be analysed for the pre-defined outcomes.&#xD;
      The management of side effects is beyond the scope of this study and will be managed as per&#xD;
      the standard clinical practice in TMC. The cost of which will be borne by the patient or&#xD;
      his/her insurance company.&#xD;
