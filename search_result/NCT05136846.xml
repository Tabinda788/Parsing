    <textblock>
      This phase I trial finds out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      papaverine when given together with chemoradiation intreating patients with stage II-III&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Papaverine targets mitochondrial metabolism to decrease the&#xD;
      cancer growth process. Giving papaverine with chemoradiation may work best to treat patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of papaverine (PPV) in combination with&#xD;
      chemoradiation (CRT) and immunotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced (LA)&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the rates of primary tumor control, local control, time to local-regional&#xD;
      progression, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). II. To assess whether&#xD;
      blood oxygen level determination (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies&#xD;
      can predict which patients may respond best to PPV + CRT, and detect changes in oxygenation&#xD;
      before and after PPV administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess whether blood-based and tissue-based biomarkers can predict which patients may&#xD;
      respond best to PPV + CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive PPV intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) and undergo 5 fractions of&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) per week. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and&#xD;
      carboplatin IV once weekly (QW) over 1-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 1 month of completing CRT, patients with PD-L1 positive&#xD;
      disease receive durvalumab IV every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed for 2 years at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12,&#xD;
      16, 20, and 24 months, then periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;
