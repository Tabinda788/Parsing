      This is a multi-center, case-driven, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled Phase&#xD;
      Ⅲb clinical trial of COVID-19 Vaccine manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co.,&#xD;
      Ltd.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the booster dose after two doses&#xD;
      of CoronaVac® against RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases in participants aged 18&#xD;
      years and above.A total of 13,800 participants aged 18 years and above, who have received 2&#xD;
      doses CoronaVac® in an interval between 21-56 days will be enrolled.Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomly assigned into 3 groups at a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive a booster dose of&#xD;
      medium-dose or high-dose COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo 5-8 months after their second&#xD;
      dose.Efficacy assessments will include the surveillance for COVID-19-like symptoms, the&#xD;
      laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, and recording of COVID-19-related&#xD;
      hospitalizations.All participants will be monitored for immediate reactions (within 30&#xD;
      minutes) after the booster dose vaccination, adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAEs) for 6 months after booster dose inoculation. In&#xD;
      addition,participants in reactogenicity subgroup will be monitored for local and systemic&#xD;
      solicited adverse events (AEs) within 7 days and the unsolicited AEs within 28&#xD;
      days.Immunogenicity assessments will be determined by neutralizing and anti-SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      S-protein antibodies in subgroup participants. The participants in the immunogenicity&#xD;
      subgroup will be in the reactogenicity subgroup as well.&#xD;
