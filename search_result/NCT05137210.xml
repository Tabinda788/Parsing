  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV self-testing (HIVST) has been found to be a highly acceptable approach for men to learn&#xD;
      of their HIV status and has resulted in increased testing uptake. However, rates of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation among those tested with HIVST are difficult to&#xD;
      capture. This clinical trial will test varying approaches to ART initiation and retention&#xD;
      among men who test positive using HIVST to learn about the most effective strategy to engage&#xD;
      men in ART services.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HIV self-testing (HIVST) has been found to be a highly acceptable approach for men to learn&#xD;
      of their HIV status and has resulted in increased testing uptake. However, rates of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation among those tested with HIVST are difficult to&#xD;
      capture and some studies have suggested that linkage rates are low , particularly amongst&#xD;
      men. The investigators propose a clinical trial to test varying approaches to ART initiation&#xD;
      and retention among men who test HIV-positive through HIVST. Three interventions will be&#xD;
      tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care (Arm 1): phone and in-person follow-up, accompanied with male-specific&#xD;
      counseling (given every two weeks for up to 90-days or until ART initiation is achieved,&#xD;
      whichever comes first); Home-Based ART initiation (Arm 2): nurse-led ART initiation at home&#xD;
      or in the community Staged Intervention (Arm 3): a staged intervention that consecutively&#xD;
      increases in intensity every month that a participant does not initiate ART (intervals&#xD;
      include: Days 1-14: Standard of Care; Days 14-30: Peer support with a psychosocial consellor;&#xD;
      Days 30-90: Nurse-led Home-Based ART initiation);&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to identify a cost-effective package comprised of male-specific&#xD;
      counseling, peer support, community ART distribution and/or home-based ART services for ART&#xD;
      initiation and retention among men identified as HIV-positive through HIVST in Malawi. The&#xD;
      specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Stepped ART Intervention (Arm 3) vs male counseling&#xD;
      and facility navigation (Arm 1) (primary analysis) and the effectiveness of the Stepped ART&#xD;
      Intervention (Arm 3) vs home-based ART initiation with a nurse (Arm 2) (secondary analysis)&#xD;
      on ART initiation within 4-months after enrollment in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Identify individual-, community-, and facility-level factors associated with ART&#xD;
      initiation within each intervention arm (male counseling, home-based ART and Stepped&#xD;
      intervention) using baseline and semi-structured in-depth interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Determine the cost-effectiveness and scalability of the intervention arms through&#xD;
      costing and mathematical modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individually randomized control trial will be performed with 545 HIV-positive men. Men&#xD;
      will be individually randomized 1:1:1 to one of the three intervention arms described above.&#xD;
      They will receive their assigned intervention over the course of three months or until the&#xD;
      participant initiates ART. The study will be preformed at 10 health facilities supported by&#xD;
      Partners in Hope (PIH). Data collection will include baseline and follow-up surveys at 2- and&#xD;
      4-months; medical charter reviews at 2- and 4-months after study enrollment; qualitative&#xD;
      interviews with a subset of men and their female partners; and a cost analysis of costs&#xD;
      associated with each arm. Male participants will be enrolled in the study for a total of 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate learning about the most effective stragty to engage men in ART.&#xD;
      The investigators also anticipate learning about the type and degree of followup necessary to&#xD;
      support men's engagement in ART services. Finally, the investigators anticipate learning&#xD;
      about the cost-effectiveness of intervention, with the goal of improving cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      for the Ministry of Health. Results from this study could be used to define best practices&#xD;
      and to further scale ART-focused programs for men in Malawi.&#xD;

    <description>At enrollment, study staff distribute two pamphlets on: 1) male-specific messaging and 2) details about home-based ART initiation. Low-level cadre traces participants and provides one-on-one, in person male-specific counseling, and a detailed description of home-based ART initiation with a nurse. Meeting at the location of participants choice. Follow-up male-specific counseling and information about home-based initiation is offered every 14 days thereafter until 90 days OR 4-week ART follow-up refill visit is complete. Participants who choose to initiate ART at home or in the community will meet with a nurse at a place of the participants choosing. Those who choose to initiate at the facility will receive facility navigation and initiation. All clients will receive a &quot;warm handover&quot; for their 4-week ART follow-up visit.</description>

    <description>Day 0-14 Arm 1 (Male-specific counseling and facility navigation arm) implemented. Day 14-30, if not yet initiated, a psychosocial counsellor will trace the participant to provide advanced counselling and motivational interviewing. Psychosocial counsellors will act as 'Male Mentors' and meet with men as frequently as needed. Day 30-89 if not yet initiated, nurse-led home-based ART initiation will be offered, following the same steps as listed in the &quot;Home-Based ART Initiation&quot; Arm.</description>
