  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common spinal deformity in children and adolescents with an&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of 3%. About one tenth of the children with scoliosis develop a&#xD;
      deformity that requires treatment with brace or surgery with the current treatment protocol.&#xD;
      In Sweden, mild scoliosis curves not requiring treatment, but at risk for progression during&#xD;
      childhood, are only observed until skeletal maturity without active treatment. If progression&#xD;
      occurs and treatment is required, standard treatment consists of bracing 20 hours or more per&#xD;
      day. Scoliosis-specific exercises have been reported to be a possible treatment modality in&#xD;
      terms of halting progression in mild scoliosis, but the findings are not generally accepted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild forms of idiopathic scoliosis are usually observed with regular clinical and&#xD;
      radiological follow-ups during growth periods. Scoliosis specific exercises have been used as&#xD;
      a method aiming to halt progression and ultimately avoid the need of brace treatment.&#xD;
      However, many cases of mild idiopathic scoliosis will not progress irrespective of treatment.&#xD;
      As of today, there are a number of different methods and approaches to scoliosis specific&#xD;
      exercises, but all with the aim to correct scoliosis in the sagittal, frontal and transverse&#xD;
      plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, the investigators seek to compare an active&#xD;
      self corrective management of scoliosis specific exercises to observation for patients with&#xD;
      mild scoliosis. Skeletally immature patients with mild idiopathic scoliosis will be&#xD;
      randomized in an online module through the Swedish spine register (www.swespine.se), to&#xD;
      receive either the intervention or observation. Outcome assessors will be blinded for the&#xD;
      type of management the patients are having. Compliance will be monitored with a mobile&#xD;
      application (Physitrack) where the patients and their families can have direct access to the&#xD;
      research personnel and their treatment. Outcome measures include changes in curve severity,&#xD;
      quality of life, number of patients requiring brace treatment and clinical outcomes. All&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated with clinical follow-ups every six months and both clinical and&#xD;
      radiological follow-ups each twelve months until either progression occurs or skeletal&#xD;
      maturity is reached. Individuals progressing and requiring brace treatment will be offered&#xD;
      standard TLSO or nighttime brace to be worn 20 hours and 8 hours, respectively, per day and&#xD;
      will be followed in the same way as other participants. Skeletal maturity is defined as less&#xD;
      than 1 cm of growth in six months. All patients will be encouraged to be physically active&#xD;
      for 60 minutes per day. When skeletal maturity has occured, patients will have clinical and&#xD;
      radiological follow-ups at 2, 5 and 10 years after treatment termination. Based on a&#xD;
      hypothesized failure rate of 10% in the scoliosis specific exercise group and 39% in the&#xD;
      observation group, with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80% and consideration for&#xD;
      dropout of up to 20% and an additional adding of five individuals per group, an estimated&#xD;
      number of 45 individuals in each group is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For individuals who are not willing to be randomized and participate in the study,&#xD;
      observation will be offered and these individuals will serve as an observational group with&#xD;
      similar follow-ups and will be asked to answer the same survey as the study groups will do.&#xD;

    <description>An active self-correction tailored to the individual type of curve and clinical presentation will be applied with the aim to correct the scoliosis in all three planes. Patients will also be informed and educated in task oriented activities of daily living. Training goals are directed towards postural control, spinal stability, muscular stabilization and endurance in corrective postures. Patients will have outpatient sessions once every two weeks the first 3 months and perform the exercises at home in 30-minutes sessions three times per week. Patients are encouraged to continue with non-specific self-mediated physical activities of moderate intensity at least 60 minutes daily. Compliance will be monitored through a mobile application (Physitrack) where the patients record their sessions and can have contact with the research personnel. A cognitive behavioral therapy approach to reinforce physical activity will be performed every 6 months.</description>
