  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer survivors are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD); it is therefore important&#xD;
      to identify patients at increased risk for cardiotoxicity, especially in the setting of CVRF&#xD;
      or pre-existing CVD, and to design personalized interventions to prevent cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity. In this background, cardio-oncology rehabilitation frameworks for specific cancer&#xD;
      patients have been proposed. Given potential beneficial effects of exercise among cancer&#xD;
      patients (including those at higher risk of CVD), data pertaining to optimal program designs&#xD;
      are of paramount contemporary importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the impact of a Cardiac Rehabilitation Program&#xD;
      (CRP) model versus a community-based exercise intervention plus usual care on&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), physical function domains and CVRF control in adult cancer&#xD;
      survivors who have been exposed to cardiotoxic cancer treatment and/or with cardiovascular&#xD;
      medical background. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline (M0) and after an 8&#xD;
      weeks-intervention (M1), comprising maximal aerobic capacity (peak oxygen uptake), muscular&#xD;
      strength, neuromuscular function, single CVRF control including physical activity&#xD;
      measurements and psychosocial parameters, health-related quality of life, fatigue, health&#xD;
      literacy, inflammatory response and feasibility metrics; an economic evaluation will provide&#xD;
      quantitative comparison, for a cost-effectiveness analysis&#xD;

    <description>Evaluated using the EuroQuol Five- Dimensional questionnaire ( EQ-5D-5L). It consists in five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ - Visual Analog Scale records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.</description>
