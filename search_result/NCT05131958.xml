  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Nasal polyposis is a chronic inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa which is characterized by&#xD;
      the development of polyps in the sinonasal cavities. In the general population, its&#xD;
      prevalence is 4% with a clear increase from the age of 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When drug treatment is not effective, and the patient's quality of life is impaired, surgery&#xD;
      is proposed. It allows to widen the nasal cavities with aerodynamic and acoustics effects on&#xD;
      speech. There are few studies, that have focused on the impact of NP and its treatment on&#xD;
      speech. Yet there is a real demand from patients to obtain answers related to the impact of&#xD;
      this surgery on their voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively and postoperatively, the resonance will be disturbed: polyps will impacted the&#xD;
      quality of the nasal sounds. And after surgery, the new anatomical shape can create an&#xD;
      excessive resonance in the nasal cavities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, there is a diversity of acoustic effects that differ according to the sinuses&#xD;
      involved, the nature and type of surgery and the anatomical and physiological specificities&#xD;
      of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impairment of acoustic properties after surgery is diverse and little known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery improves the communication between sinuses and nasal cavities but the real impact&#xD;
      on nasal resonance still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The particularity of this pathology stands in the obstruction of the sinonasal cavity by&#xD;
      polyps. On this study, it represents a model of nasality disturbance/impairment ? Indeed, all&#xD;
      aspects of nasality will be altered : the articulation by the obstruction of the sino-nasal&#xD;
      cavities, the aerodynamic by a disturbance of the circulation of the airflow within the nasal&#xD;
      cavity, acoustics by an alteration of the resonance of this flow, and finally the perception&#xD;
      of speech by others where the comprehension of speech is difficult. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      wish to observe this dysfunction in a multipara metric way in order to have an accurate&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This population is therefore ideal. In preoperative, it will allow to measure by aerodynamic,&#xD;
      articulatory, acoustic, and perceptive data taking this dysfunction, to give precise answers.&#xD;
      Then, postoperatively, these measurements will be repeated to observe a return to the&#xD;
      expected functioning of the nasal cavity. Indeed, the cavities being no longer congested, a&#xD;
      greater flow of nasal air would be expected, which would have acoustic consequences on the&#xD;
      resonance of nasal sounds. This could be accentuated because of the new anatomical&#xD;
      configuration due to the surgery. Perceptually, the voice after surgery should no longer be&#xD;
      considered as pathological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the linguistics aspect, this population has the particularity of having a&#xD;
      strongly impacted quality of life. The investigators would therefore like to measure this&#xD;
      impact on quality of life before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the main objective is to measure the articulatory, aerodynamics, acoustics&#xD;
      and perceptive impact of the nasal polyposis on speech before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the secondaries objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the differences in aerodynamic, acoustic, articulatory and perceptual changes&#xD;
           between the &quot;&quot;presence of polyps in the nasal and sinus cavities&quot;&quot; group and the&#xD;
           &quot;&quot;presence of polyps in the sinus cavities&quot;&quot; group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the modifications on the speech of the pathology before and after surgical&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the elements related to the quality of life impacted by this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the glottic compensation strategies induced by the pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare preoperative and postoperative nasal resonance and the relationship between&#xD;
           nasal and sinus cavities using 3D models&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validate the adequacy of the nasality-speech questionnaire for patients with sinonasal&#xD;
           polyposis&quot;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Nasal polyposis, a pathology related to speech Nasal polyposis (NP) is a chronic bilateral&#xD;
      inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa characterized by the development of polyps in the sinus&#xD;
      and nasal cavities. In the general population, its prevalence is 4% with a clear increase&#xD;
      from the age of 50 years. Two clinical forms of NP exist: primary polyposis which is isolated&#xD;
      or integrated in Widal's disease, secondary polyposis when it appears in the context of&#xD;
      diseases such as cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia or immune deficiencies. NP is a diffuse&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis, i.e. it affects both the anterior and posterior sinuses bilaterally. When&#xD;
      drug treatment is not effective, and the patient's quality of life is impaired, surgery is&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment consists of removing the polypoid mucosa to repermeabilize the nasal&#xD;
      cavities and/or to enlarge the ostia (communication openings between the nasal cavities and&#xD;
      the sinuses) and to allow drainage again. This surgery goes beyond the repermeation of the&#xD;
      sinuses since it will allow to widen the nasal cavity with aerodynamic and acoustic&#xD;
      consequences on speech; indeed, it will allow to bring a greater resonance of the vocal and&#xD;
      nasal duct. To our knowledge, there are few studies that have focused on the impact of NP and&#xD;
      its treatment on speech. Yet there is a real demand from patients to obtain answers related&#xD;
      to the impact of this surgery on their voice. A pathology such as NP falls directly within&#xD;
      the scope of clinical phonetics, i.e. the description and understanding of the mechanisms of&#xD;
      articulatory and acoustic production of speech, applied to the pathology. The NP will disturb&#xD;
      the communication on the production side by altering the nasal resonance essential in the&#xD;
      production for the distinction between oral and nasal sounds but also on the receiver's side&#xD;
      who will have difficulties to understand the message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, preoperatively and postoperatively, the resonant capacities will be disturbed: in the&#xD;
      sense of a hyponasality before surgery due to the presence of polyps which will affect the&#xD;
      quality of nasal sounds. Then potentially, the risk of a hypernasality after surgery because&#xD;
      of the new anatomical configuration. Indeed, there is a diversity of acoustic effects that&#xD;
      differ according to the sinuses involved, the nature and type of surgery and the anatomical&#xD;
      and physiological specificities of the patient. The alteration of acoustic properties of&#xD;
      phonemes after endonasal sinus surgery is diverse and not well known. It is known that NP&#xD;
      surgery allows better communication between the sinus and nasal cavities but the real impact&#xD;
      on nasal resonances is not known. The same is true for the activity of the vocal folds. There&#xD;
      is a link between nasality and voicing, i.e. the vibration of the vocal folds necessary for&#xD;
      the production of voiced sounds. Nasality favors voicing. Indeed, to establish voicing, the&#xD;
      maintenance of an airflow through the glottic plane is necessary, a passage of air through&#xD;
      the nasal cavity facilitates the maintenance of this flow. Preoperatively, since air cannot&#xD;
      pass through the nasal cavity, compensatory mechanisms may appear, such as increased voicing&#xD;
      or glottic thrust. Thanks to electroglottography, the quality of this voicing preoperatively&#xD;
      and postoperatively will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NP can therefore be an obstacle to the phenomenon of nasality. Indeed, the airflow in the&#xD;
      nasal cavities will be disturbed because of the presence of polyps, which will have&#xD;
      consequences on the resonance of these cavities as a whole. This project would provide a&#xD;
      deeper understanding of the mechanism of nasal production. It results from the coupling of&#xD;
      two cavities: the nasal and oral cavities, which will produce an anti-resonance phenomenon (a&#xD;
      resonance phenomenon specific to nasality) and make this resonance process extremely complex.&#xD;
      The impact of nasality on the acoustic signal is known (anti-formants etc.) but these&#xD;
      manifestations remain diverse and dependent on individual anatomical variability. The impact&#xD;
      of the sinuses on speech remains poorly understood today. The controversy between researchers&#xD;
      on their influence on speech, encourages us to better explore their role in speech. But also&#xD;
      to analyze the phenomenon of resonance before and after surgery to understand the&#xD;
      consequences on speech intelligibility and the predictability of the consequences on the&#xD;
      speech of patients postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding dysfunction in the context of NP will allow us to learn more about the&#xD;
      functioning and production mechanisms of nasality in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The articulatory approach is central to our project. The articulation of speech differs&#xD;
      according to the nature of the sound: the production of consonants will require a closure or&#xD;
      a constriction in the oral cavity while for vowels the free passage of air is necessary. In&#xD;
      addition to the mode of articulation, the sounds are also characterized by the cavity that&#xD;
      enters in resonance: only the oral cavity or in addition to this last the nasal cavity. The&#xD;
      resonance of the air within the nasal cavity will therefore allow the production of nasal&#xD;
      sounds. Thus, the volume of the sinonasal cavities and the relationship between the nasal&#xD;
      cavity and the sinuses have a role in the articulation of these nasal sounds. Medical imaging&#xD;
      is our means of studying their articulation since it will allow us to quantify and visualize&#xD;
      the sinonasal cavities and their mutual relationship. It will allow us to precisely grasp the&#xD;
      extent of the impact of the sinuses on speech. These scannographic data will be compared with&#xD;
      aerodynamic, acoustic and perceptual data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The particularity of this pathology lies in the obstruction of the nasal and sinuses cavities&#xD;
      by polyps. In the context of our study, it represents a model of disturbance of the nasality.&#xD;
      Indeed, all the aspects of the nasality will be altered: the articulatory by the obstruction&#xD;
      of the cavities, the aerodynamics by a disturbance of the circulation of the air flow within&#xD;
      the nasal cavity, the acoustics by an alteration of the resonance of this flow, the vibration&#xD;
      of the vocal folds by phenomena of compensation, and finally the perception of speech by&#xD;
      others where the comprehension of speech is difficult. Thus, this dysfunction should to be&#xD;
      observed in a multiparametric way in order to have a precise approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This population is thus ideal, in preoperative, it will allow to measure by aerodynamic,&#xD;
      articulatory, acoustic, and perceptive data taking this dysfunction and to give precise&#xD;
      answers. Then, postoperatively, these measurements will be repeated to observe a return to&#xD;
      the expected functioning of the nasal cavity. Indeed, the cavities being no longer congested,&#xD;
      a greater nasal airflow would be expected, which would have acoustic consequences on the&#xD;
      resonance of nasal sounds. This could be accentuated because of the new anatomical&#xD;
      configuration due to the surgery. Perceptually, the voice after surgery should no longer be&#xD;
      considered as pathological. And on the glottic level, the phenomena of compensation would no&#xD;
      longer be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the linguistics aspect, this population has the particularity of having a&#xD;
      strongly impacted quality of life. the investigators would therefore like to measure this&#xD;
      impact on quality of life before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research focuses on a voice recording: an aerodynamic recording with a mask and an&#xD;
      acoustic recording with a microphone and an electroglottograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, with the acoustic data, a perception test will be designed to observe whether naive&#xD;
      listeners perceive this alteration of nasality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research also focuses on self-assessment questionnaires of quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questionnaires allow to understand the image that the speaker has of his/her voice. In&#xD;
      the context of patients, the difficulties that people with rhino-sinus pathologies may have&#xD;
      in their daily life will be understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will complete two voice-specific questionnaires: the Voice Handicap Index&#xD;
      (VHI) and the Speech Handicap Index (SHI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a questionnaire of 4 questions dealing more specifically with the phenomena of&#xD;
      nasality will be proposed. But also on the adaptations put in place by the speaker to speak&#xD;
      and on the difficulty to read the corpus. One part of the questionnaire comes from a study by&#xD;
      Behrman &amp; al (2002) and the other one was made by investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multiparametric approach is necessary for phonetic studies and even more so in the case&#xD;
      of nasality, which is a complex phenomenon whose manifestations are different depending on&#xD;
      whether one is looking at it from the articulatory, aerodynamic or acoustic point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manifestations of nasality are different depending on whether one is looking at it from&#xD;
      the articulatory, aerodynamic or acoustic point of view. In order to have an optimal&#xD;
      understanding of nasality and its alterations in the context of NP, the observation cannot be&#xD;
      limited to aerodynamic, acoustic, and perceptual parameters alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no speech-related study has sought to quantify sinus volume. The use of&#xD;
      scannographic data (low-dose CT) is already used by the ENT surgeon to visualize the extent&#xD;
      of polyps in the sinuses preoperatively and to verify the effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
      It is essential to this study in order to theorize the morphological variability of the&#xD;
      sinuses: bilateral volume asymmetry. Knowing the variability of the sinuses will allow to&#xD;
      estimate their impact on nasal resonance and eventually on voice and speech. Postoperatively,&#xD;
      the CT scan will allow to quantify the anatomical changes related to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging data, with these two scans before and after surgery, will allow to quantify the&#xD;
      volumes of the nasal cavities and sinuses, and to quantify the volume of the polyps, which&#xD;
      will lead to a 3D reconstruction. The latter will lead to acoustic simulations. The&#xD;
      quantification of the volumes coupled with a 3D reconstruction will thus be central to this&#xD;
      project and will allow to deepen the knowledge and to target the relationship between the&#xD;
      sinuses and the resonance, and the relationship between the sinuses and the phenomenon of&#xD;
      nasality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the impact of NP and surgery on speech could therefore represent a major help&#xD;
      for the clinician to provide answers to patients and inform them of possible changes. Indeed,&#xD;
      at present, there are no models capable of predicting the possible acoustic and aerodynamic&#xD;
      consequences of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This articulatory aspect is particularly innovative because currently, to knowledge, there&#xD;
      are no correlations between the medical imaging data of the sinuses (volume, geometry of the&#xD;
      sinonasal cavities...) and the production of speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the active file of patients followed in the recruiting center&#xD;
      according to the eligibility criteria. After verification of the inclusion and non-inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the investigator will propose to the patients to participate in the study and will&#xD;
      deliver the information and collect their non-opposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the patient will be included in the study and an information and non-opposition form&#xD;
      for the research will be given to him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and para-clinical data (CT scan and nasal endoscopy), demographic and&#xD;
      socio-demographic data, medical history, sinus quality of life questionnaire (SNOT-22)&#xD;
      performed as part of the care will be collected in the observation booklet. In addition,&#xD;
      voice recordings and voice and nasal-specific quality of life questionnaires (VHI, SHI and&#xD;
      nasal-speech relationship) will be made for the purpose of the research. These data will be&#xD;
      collected during two visits of the patient's care (preoperative visit and 3 months&#xD;
      postoperative visit). The voice recordings will take place during these two visits and will&#xD;
      last approximately 20 minutes. They will take place in the same way preoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative visit: The voice recording and the quality of life questionnaires at the&#xD;
      preoperative visit will take place either during the visit with the ENT surgeon where the&#xD;
      non-opposition will be collected, or during the anesthesia consultation. This will be&#xD;
      determined according to the patient's expected waiting time during these appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, the recording will take place during the ENT check-up appointment scheduled&#xD;
      in the care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recording will take place as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A presentation of the recording equipment by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will place the mask on his face and the electroglottograph around his neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the recording, the patient will be asked to read a text.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Finally, the patient will fill in the 3 voice quality questionnaires. Once the patients are&#xD;
      recorded, a data processing phase will follow: segmentation of the recordings, analysis and&#xD;
      acoustic and aerodynamic measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be reviewed at their M3 postoperative follow-up appointment with the&#xD;
      same data collection and examinations as the preoperative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data related to the current care and the data of the questionnaires will be&#xD;
      collected in real time or a posteriori by the investigators and/or by the doctoral student&#xD;
      Amélie Elmerich on a paper support at first. The aerodynamic and acoustic data will be&#xD;
      collected on the doctoral student's professional computer simultaneously with the reading of&#xD;
      the text by the patient, using the acoustic and aerodynamic data acquisition software&#xD;
      QuickDaq.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data directly collected in the CRF will be the recording data: aerodynamic, acoustic,&#xD;
      electroglottographic recording, and the scores obtained from the questionnaires (VHI, SHI,&#xD;
      nasal-speech questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care-related data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-interventional study. All clinical, socio-demographic (age, sex, languages&#xD;
      spoken, professional status), para-clinical, medical history data, the practice of an&#xD;
      activity that requires an important use of the voice (singing, theater, wind instruments,&#xD;
      teaching...), the consultation of a professional for voice, language, speech problems will be&#xD;
      collected during usual care. All these data will be collected in a pseudonymized way (patient&#xD;
      reference in the study: center number - enrollment number in the center - initials) from the&#xD;
      patient's medical record (source record).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic data, the practice of an activity that requires an important use of the&#xD;
      voice (singing, theater, wind instruments, teaching...) and the consultation of a&#xD;
      professional for voice, language, speech problems. These data, specific to the individual,&#xD;
      will allow us to understand certain results, they can have an influence on the results. They&#xD;
      will also allow us to make hypotheses about a result that would be below or above the average&#xD;
      values (flow, value of formants...). But also to observe through certain parameters which&#xD;
      would be common (sex, age, profession etc.) between participants if there are similarities in&#xD;
      their aerodynamic or acoustic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research-related data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research-specific quality of life questionnaires will be collected in the Case Report Form&#xD;
      (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recordings (aerodynamic and acoustic data) will be collected by the doctoral student&#xD;
      Amélie Elmerich at the Bicêtre hospital simultaneously with the recording of the patient,&#xD;
      when he will read the text on the QuickDaq software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will then be analyzed by her at the Phonetics and Phonology Laboratory (Sorbonne&#xD;
      Nouvelle University).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of voice data (acoustic and aerodynamic recording, quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires) will take place at the Bicêtre hospital. Then these data will be transferred&#xD;
      to the Université Sorbonne Nouvelle where they will be processed by the doctoral student&#xD;
      Amélie Elmerich under the responsibility of Lise Crevier-Buchman and Angélique Amelot. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be carried out by the doctoral student Amélie Elmerich.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study is observational, there is no statistical justification for the number of&#xD;
      patients. This number of participants (30) is chosen because it allows to make sufficient&#xD;
      subgroups in terms of location of polyps and stage of severity in order to perform a phonetic&#xD;
      analysis later on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential and descriptive statistics will be performed. The descriptive statistics will&#xD;
      allow a first approach, it will be a question of using descriptive statistics in order to&#xD;
      obtain average values, standard deviations and the range of duration of the sounds, oral and&#xD;
      nasal airflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential statistics will allow to complete the descriptive approach thanks to hypothesis&#xD;
      tests (Anova for example) and thanks to the creation of a linear mixed model. The analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted within each group (&quot;&quot;Presence of polyps in the nasal and sinus cavities&quot;&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;&quot;Presence of polyps in the sinus cavities&quot;&quot;) by comparing different parameters (aerodynamic,&#xD;
      acoustic, articulatory and perceptual) in order to highlight significant changes between&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, variables such as gender or severity stage will be used to measure their potential&#xD;
      impact on statistical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A linear mixed model will be established to observe the effect of surgery, gender and stage&#xD;
      of severity on aerodynamic (oral and nasal airflow), acoustic (formant measurements) and&#xD;
      articulatory (sino-nasal cavity volume) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on a voice recording. In case of missing data in a recording, the rest of&#xD;
      the data present will still be taken into account and analyzed&quot;&#xD;
