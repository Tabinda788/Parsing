  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has over decades showed that marine food carries nutritional characteristics that&#xD;
      promote human health. As seen in epidemiological studies and based on in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      studies, it is hypothesized that unrefined salmon oil as dietary supplement have&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect. However, there is sufficient preliminary data to indicate bioactive&#xD;
      compounds effect for clinical use, and further clinical trials investigating effect are&#xD;
      needed. This trial will investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect and reduction in&#xD;
      the risk of cardio artery disease in patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive disease,&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, investigating unrefined&#xD;
      salmon oil, CARDIO®, additional to standard care for patients suffering from COPD. The&#xD;
      investigational product is an unrefined salmon oil based soft-gel formulation containing 21&#xD;
      different fatty acids (more than 99.1%), lipopeptides (less than 0.9%), antioxidants and&#xD;
      other micro metabolites. Research has shown that marine foods carry nutritional&#xD;
      characteristics that promote human health, particularly the high intake of long-chain n-3&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA), eicosapentaeonic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid&#xD;
      (DHA). Cell culture and mouse studies have shown that n-3 PUFAs, such as EPA and DHA, reduce&#xD;
      lung leucocyte infiltration and decrease inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence points to elevated circulating levels of oxidative low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (ox-LDL) as a key factor that couples COPD with coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
      When normal lipoprotein (LDL) becomes oxidized, the structural alteration confers highly&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory properties, inducing inflammation and oxidative stress processes central to&#xD;
      both COPD and CAD. Ox-LDL is a potent activator of eosinophils, after which the eosinophils&#xD;
      appear to mediate chronic inflammation. Based on the literature and studies on the&#xD;
      investigational product, the investigators will investigate if CARDIO® can influence&#xD;
      eosinophilic inflammation and ox-LDL. This could have positive consequences for improving&#xD;
      COPD control and reducing the risk of exacerbations and cardiovascular events. The&#xD;
      generalized anti-inflammatory effects and inflammation-resolution promoting effects of&#xD;
      unrefined salmon oil might reduce systemic inflammation and benefit COPD patients with&#xD;
      co-existing CAD. In this study, the investigators intend to recruit patients with raised&#xD;
      oxidative stress represented by patients with serum ox-LDL level at the 25th percentile and&#xD;
      above. Therefore, the investigators intend to recruit 20 participants (part 1) with the same&#xD;
      inclusion criteria as in part 2, but only measure/analysis serum ox-LDL. The ox-LDL levels&#xD;
      derived from part 1 of the study will provide a cut-off level of ox-LDL for patient inclusion&#xD;
      into the study part 2. Patient with an ox-LDL value above the 25th percentile will be asked&#xD;
      to participate in part 2 of the study. The investigators believe that this will provide the&#xD;
      most accurate inclusion of patients to part 2 of the study - the intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, clinical trials in humans diagnosed with COPD, have shown varied results&#xD;
      investigating n-3 PUFA supplementation. The objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      specifically the impact of CARDIO® compared to placebo, on ox-LDL, forced expiratory airflow,&#xD;
      blood eosinophils and markers of inflammation in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by pulmonary function tests (spirometry), blood sample, nutritional&#xD;
      log, quality of life questionnaires (CAT), and blood and stool collected for research&#xD;
      biobanking. Study intervention period will be 20 weeks, plus 4 weeks post-intervention&#xD;
      follow-up, foremost of safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical power calculations assure a recruitment of a sufficient number of patients to&#xD;
      allow the detection of significant changes if any exist.&#xD;
