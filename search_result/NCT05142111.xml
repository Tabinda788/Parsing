  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study patients with Multiple Sclerosis or Spinal Lesions will participate in two&#xD;
      different types of treatments that aim to improve sexual and sentimental life. Behavioral&#xD;
      (via questionnaires) and brain (via high-density electroencephalogram) effects associated&#xD;
      with treatment will be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with neurological diseases can experience sexual disorders that can affect their&#xD;
      quality of life. There are cognitive treatments to improve these aspects, but their&#xD;
      effectiveness is not clear. The aim of this study is to test the potential efficacy of two&#xD;
      treatments (mindfulness and sezual therapy) in two neurological populations (patients with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis and patients with spinal injury). To verify the effects of the treatment,&#xD;
      questionnaires and brain activity measurements, measured by electroencephalogram, will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in brain spectral power after viewing neutral and erotic videos</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after treatment (circa 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in response of brain networks at rest and during viewing of emotional stimuli with sexual content. The recording will consist of 5 minutes of resting state (recording at rest). 8 total minutes of viewing of stimuli consisting of videos with an erotic and neutral emotional content. In particular, the subject will see two videos with an erotic content and two with an emotionally neutral content (the duration of each video is about 2 minutes). These stimuli will be selected from a standardized and validated visual battery for scientific studies presented in (Maffei &amp; Angrilli, 2019).&#xD;
The spectral power across brain regions will be assessed by parametric spectral decomposition&#xD;
-presence and modulation of large scale patterns of correlated activity, assessed by means of measures of statistical dependency (correlation, mutual information)</description>

    <time_frame>Before and after treatment (circa 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire&#xD;
PWB (Psychological Well-Being Scale). Questionnaire aimed at defining the patient's psychological well-being profile through items that evaluate the dimensions of self-acceptance, autonomy, environmental control, life purpose, personal growth and positive relationships with others (Ruini et al., 2003).&#xD;
Questionnaire responses will be aggregated by factor analysis</description>

    <description>Assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire&#xD;
BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory). Questionnaire consisting of 21 items that describe anxiety in its subjective, neurophysiological and autonomic aspects. (Sica &amp; Ghisi, 2007; Starosta &amp; Brenner, 2018). The BAI has also been found to be a tool with high sensitivity to anxiety levels in patients with multiple sclerosis (Watson et al., 2014).&#xD;

    <description>Self-assessment questionnaires of the emotional content of stimuli, in particular the self-assessment manikin (SAM) will be used (Bradley MM, Lang PJ). With this questionnaire, through pictorial representations of &quot;mannequins&quot;, the patient will be asked to evaluate his emotional reactions while watching the videos, in terms of the intensity of the emotions felt and the positive or negative values of the sensations experienced during the vision.</description>
