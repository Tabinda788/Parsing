      This clinical trial is a phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and&#xD;
      immune persistence of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in healthy people aged 18 years and above.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the clinical trial including an open-label, single-arm Phase I study and a subsequent&#xD;
      randomized, blind, placebo-parallel controlled Phase II study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and immune persistence of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in healthy people aged 18-60&#xD;
      years and ≥18 years respectively, whose locations or circumstances put them at appreciable&#xD;
      risk of acquiring COVID-19 and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
