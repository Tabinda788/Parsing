      Covid-19 pandemic has affected hundreds of millions globally(https&#xD;
      ://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), and hundreds of thousands in&#xD;
      Egypt(https://www.care.gov.eg/EgyptCare/Index.aspx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the long-term consequences of the disease are still largely unknown. Data from&#xD;
      2002-2004 epidemics of SARS suggest that cardiovascular sequelae, such as microangiopathy,&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and impaired endothelial function, are to be expected also in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients.(Vittori et al, 2020) Hyperinflammation and immunosuppression are prominently&#xD;
      featured in COVID-19, causing a cytokine storm leading to development of micro-thrombosisand&#xD;
      disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). (Jose et al, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings can be extremely relevant for male and female sexual health: indeed, based on&#xD;
      these premises, there is quite enough evidence to hypothesize that consequences of COVID-19&#xD;
      can extend to sexual and reproductive health. (Sansone et al, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A self-administered questionnaire will be disseminated using online electronic social network&#xD;
      (Facebook, What's App) including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic age&amp; gender. Sexual dysfunction will be assessed using International Index&#xD;
      of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) for males, and Arabic Female Sexual Function Index (ArFSFI)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a first-time challenge for healthcare. Despite&#xD;
      of social distancing and isolation measures, the number of affected patients is growing&#xD;
      daily. (Isidori et al, 2020) As of November 14th , 2021, more than 253.2 million COVID-19&#xD;
      cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 5 million deaths&amp; more than 229.3 million&#xD;
      subjects have recovered from COVID-19 worldwide. (https ://coronaviru s.jhu.edu/map.html)&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in Egypt more than 343 thousand COVID-19 cases with more than 19 thousand deaths have&#xD;
      been confirmed&amp; more than 282 thousand recoveries.&#xD;
      (https://www.care.gov.eg/EgyptCare/Index.aspx)&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the long-term consequences of the disease are still largely unknown. Data from&#xD;
      2002-2004 epidemics of SARS suggest that cardiovascular sequelae, such as microangiopathy,&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and impaired endothelial function, are to be expected also in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. (Vittori et al, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperinflammation and immunosuppression are prominently featured in COVID-19, causing a&#xD;
      cytokine storm leading to development of micro-thrombosisand disseminated intravascular&#xD;
      coagulation (DIC). (Jose et al, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cytokine storm is strongly associated with the development of interstitial pneumonia&#xD;
      (IP), however, although lungs are the primarily targeted organs, the cardiovascular system is&#xD;
      globally affected.(Sun X et al, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence in this regard supports the notion that the exaggerated production of early response&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, increases the risk of vascular hyperpermeability,possibly&#xD;
      progressing to multiple organ failure and,ultimately, death.(Sansone et al, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, both venous and arterial thromboembolic complications as deep venous thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT) and stroke, including endothelial inflammation, have been reported. (Lodigiani et al,&#xD;
      2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, a growing body of evidence seems to support the theory that the endothelium is&#xD;
      targeted by the SARS-CoV-2; (Sardu et al, 2020) most importantly, the endothelium expresses&#xD;
      the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),through which the virus can access host&#xD;
      cells. (Zhang et al, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunctions, therefore, a pivotal determinant of COVID-19symptoms. (Jung et al,&#xD;
      2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings can be extremely relevant for male and female sexual health: indeed, based on&#xD;
      these premises, there is quite enough evidence to hypothesize that consequences of COVID-19&#xD;
      can extend to sexual and reproductive health. (Sansone et al, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is very limited literature on the incidence of sexual dysfunctions, particularly in&#xD;
      women.(McCabe et al, 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on the incidence of sexual dysfunction in women are scarce and there is a deficiency&#xD;
      of data available on this topic. In a recent study from the United Kingdom, Burri and Spector&#xD;
      found that 5.8% of women reported symptoms that constituted a diagnosis of Female Sexual&#xD;
      Dysfunction(FSD) and15.5% reported lifelong FSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few epidemiologic surveys addressing the incidence,as opposed to prevalence, of&#xD;
      sexual disorders in men and there are large differences among existing studies. These&#xD;
      differences can be explained by variations in study design, populations studied, and&#xD;
      definitions of sexual dysfunctions. Because of these variations, itis impossible to specify&#xD;
      the incidence of sexual dysfunctions inmen. Most research has been conducted on Erectile&#xD;
      Dysfunction(ED). The most important common theme of the studies is that the incidence of&#xD;
      sexual dysfunctions increases with age. (McCabe et al, 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A self-administered questionnaire will be disseminated using online electronic social network&#xD;
      (Facebook, What's App) including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociodemographic age&amp; gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sexual dysfunction will be assessed using International Index of Erectile Function-5&#xD;
           (IIEF-5) for males, and Arabic Female Sexual Function Index (ArFSFI) for females will be&#xD;
           applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Covid-19 related factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Duration of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Duration since recovery (in months)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Diagnosis done by (PCR, rapid test, other)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Complications (respiratory, vascular, cardiac, other)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Quarantine (ICU, hospital, home, other)&#xD;
