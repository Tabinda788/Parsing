    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      olaparib is an effective treatment for people with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer&#xD;
      or endometrial carcinosarcoma. The researchers will also look at the safety of the drug&#xD;
      combination and whether it causes few or mild side effects in participants.&#xD;
