  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to assess how the implementation of Float-REST&#xD;
      affects sleep quality, sleep structure, nocturnal physiology, subjective wellness, recovery&#xD;
      from stressors, and resultant effects on performance and well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional flotation therapy (Float-REST; Flotation Restricted Environmental Stimulation&#xD;
      Therapy) uses sensory deprivation tanks that consist of a very large warm water enclosure&#xD;
      with a high concentration of Epsom salt to create a completely buoyant environment. This,&#xD;
      along with a combination of temperature that is kept equal to skin temperature (94 degrees),&#xD;
      allows the participant to eliminate the gravitational effects on the body, and along with&#xD;
      lack of sound and low to no light (depending on comfort) allows the brain and body to&#xD;
      completely relax for augmented physical and mental recovery. Previous studies have examined&#xD;
      the effects of sensory-deprivation tanks on both subjective (e.g., perceived stress and&#xD;
      anxiety, self-reported muscle soreness) and objective measures of recovery (e.g., blood&#xD;
      pressure, skill performance) though findings are incomplete and contradictory. Additionally,&#xD;
      provided the growing understanding that sleep quality and quantity are at the forefront of&#xD;
      ensuring optimal human performance states, compounded by the deleterious effects of high&#xD;
      stress and anxiety on sleep, utilizing flotation therapy as a mechanism for enhancing sleep&#xD;
      requires further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify whether Float-REST influences sleep and related behaviors, an eight week design&#xD;
      will be executed that comprises an initial four weeks of baseline data collections followed&#xD;
      by four weeks of intervention application and measure. Intervention will consist of three 60&#xD;
      minute Float-REST sessions per week, for the first three weeks of the intervention block&#xD;
      (weeks 5-7 of the study). Data measures include wearable device monitoring, surveys, and&#xD;
      brief cognitive tasks that are collected at various timepoints throughout the study (intake,&#xD;
      monthly, weekly, daily, etc.).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will complete the following design. Women who experience menstrual flow will be scheduled to ensure that flow occurs on weeks 4 and 8 for consistency.&#xD;
Baseline block (weeks 1-4): At intake, participants will complete up to 13 surveys, which includes two baseline questionnaires, &amp; the first rendition of weekly and monthly surveys. Participants will complete daily surveys each morning &amp; night, &amp; wear wearable devices to monitor physiology during sleep. Additionally, a laboratory visit will occur once per week for completion of weekly surveys &amp; cognitive assessments; monthly surveys will also be completed during the fourth week.&#xD;
Intervention block (weeks 5-8): Daily, weekly, &amp; monthly activities described for the baseline block will continue. Additionally, during weeks 5-7, participants will complete three 60-minute Float-REST sessions per week; The final week of this block will only involve the daily, weekly &amp; monthly activities plus an exit survey.</intervention_model_description>
