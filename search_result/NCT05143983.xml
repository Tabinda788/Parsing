  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressed subjects display a cognitive bias of information processing and emotional&#xD;
      self-regulation, which reinforces negative experiences more than positive ones, known as the&#xD;
      negativity bias. The link between depressive disorder and negativity bias has been much&#xD;
      studied in terms of genetic, neurobiology, structural and functional neuroanatomy and&#xD;
      cognitive sciences. It has been admitted that depressed subjects show impairment of facial&#xD;
      expressions and prosody recognition, and of implicit memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of depressive or elated mood with musical excerpts listening in healthy subjects&#xD;
      influences facial emotions perception, respectively by reducing or enhancing recognition&#xD;
      skills. However, no study to date already explored the interest of music-induced positive&#xD;
      mood for alleviating negativity bias in depressed elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective : to assess the impact of exposure to positive valence musical excerpts, on&#xD;
      evaluation of facial emotions intensity, in a population of elderly patients hospitalized for&#xD;
      depression, compared to neutral valence music listening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives : to assess the impact of exposure to positive valence musical excerpts,&#xD;
      on facial and vocal emotions recognition, and on implicit memory of faces, compared to&#xD;
      neutral valence music listening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same methodology is also applied in a sample of control participants over 65 years to&#xD;
      study the mood induction effect by music in elderlies.&#xD;

      The duration of the study, from first to last included subject, is estimated at 6 months,&#xD;
      from January to June 2022. Each subject will participate for a period of 5 to 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressed group subjects will be pre-selected from all consecutive patients hospitalized or&#xD;
      seen in consultation in geronto-psychiatric ward at Centre Hospitalier Le Vinatier, who&#xD;
      agreed to participate in research. Patients will pass a basic cognitive task (MMSE) during&#xD;
      the inclusion visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls will be selected from relatives of patients admitted in Centre Hospitalier&#xD;
      Le Vinatier, who agreed to participate in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once included, subjects will be randomized, and will remain blind to study hypotheses until&#xD;
      the study end.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Two groups of participants will be recruited: depressed patients and healthy controls. Each of these groups will be divided in two arms: one group listening to positive music at the first testing visit and neutral music at the second one, and the other group being exposed to positive and neutral conditions in the reverse order.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional intensity score of facial expressions, rated by participants</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 days</time_frame>
    <description>This intensity score will be calculated for a subject as the mean of intensity scores (from 1 to 5) attributed to negative faces and reverse intensity scores attributed to positive faces. This will give a &quot;negativity score&quot;. The higher this score, the more negative emotions are judged as intense and the less positive emotions are judged as intense. This measurement will be collected by a computerized interface in two different sessions, one for each experimental condition.</description>
