  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of removal of&#xD;
      Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) using a new investigational equipment based on high-intensity&#xD;
      focused ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer in Europe, Australia and the U.S.A. The&#xD;
      general upwards age shift in the population in these regions is expected to be accompanied by&#xD;
      an increase in the incidence of this type of cancer. There are currently more the 20.000 BCC&#xD;
      registrations in Denmark every year, and occurrences on a global scale are counted in several&#xD;
      tens of millions per year. Finding new and more effective treatment methods are therefore&#xD;
      highly relevant from both a clinical and socioeconomic perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device used in the investigation is a Danish developed system capable of&#xD;
      making controlled and targeted thermo-mechanical treatment of small intradermal volumes&#xD;
      containing e.g. BCC cells, but without inflicting damage to the surrounding tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation involves an evaluation of the safety and efficacy profile 3 months after a&#xD;
      single 3-5 minute treatment. Subsequent follow-up of secondary endpoints is done every third&#xD;
      month until the end of the study one year after the treatment.&#xD;

The investigation is performed prior to CE mark to confirm safety and performance of the System ONE-M device when used as intended, i.e. as an non-invasive method to remove non-nodular basal cell carcinoma by 20 MHz high intensity focused ultrasound.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of each gender aged 18 years or older at the time of informed consent. There&#xD;
             is no upper limit of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received oral and written study information, accepted participation&#xD;
             and signed the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are willing and mentally and physically capable to understand and follow&#xD;
             the treatment and follow-up schedule including post-treatment care instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are willing to have photographs and images taken of the treated lesions&#xD;
             to be used anonymously or coded in evaluations and publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who have histologically and clinically verified basal cell carcinoma either&#xD;
             as newly diagnosed non-nodular cancer (one group) or as a recurrent cancer in a local&#xD;
             site (another group) previously treated with any method practiced in dermatology&#xD;
             clinics, hospital or the primary sector. Tumors of thickness more than 2.0 mm measured&#xD;
             by ultrasound or OTC are considered of the &quot;nodular&quot; type. Thus, only tumors of&#xD;
             thickness 2.0mm and less are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are less than 18 years at the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant or lactating at time of first treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with extensive, invasive or advanced skin cancer when another method in use&#xD;
             such as radiotherapy or Mohs' surgery has priority and offers the patient better&#xD;
             opportunity of cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cancers on anatomical sites where the ultrasound probe cannot be adapted for&#xD;
             anatomical reasons&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any systemic disease that according to investigator's assessment may interfere with&#xD;
             the spontaneous course of a skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition predisposing to treatment-related adverse effects or complications from&#xD;
             the ultrasound treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with abnormal scar formation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with impaired wound healing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with the basal cell carcinoma under study located nearby (&lt;5 cm) an implant&#xD;
             or a site injected with a dermal filler or paraffin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any other acute or chronic condition which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
