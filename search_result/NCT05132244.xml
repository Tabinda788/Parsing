  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether or not it is feasible to closely monitor and manage&#xD;
      glucose levels in people with pancreatic cancer. It will also investigate what impact glucose&#xD;
      management may have on pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study that will use continuous glucose monitors (CGM) to monitor glucose&#xD;
      levels in approximately 50 participants with pancreatic cancer. Participants will receive&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy with a combination of up to four drugs to treat their pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer: oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX). To treat high&#xD;
      glucose levels, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive anti-hyperglycemic treatment as guided by an endocrinologist with the aim of&#xD;
      maintaining glucose levels between 4 and 10 mmol/L; Group 2 will receive anti-hyperglycemic&#xD;
      treatment if their glucose levels are above 15 mmol/L, which is standard care. Participants&#xD;
      in both Groups 1 and 2 will receive standard anti-hyperglycemic treatments: metformin,&#xD;
      insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium glucose co-transporter&#xD;
      (SGLT2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX, the CGM will be removed but any anti-hyperglycemic treatments&#xD;
      will continue as needed. If participants discontinue treatment with FOLFIRINOX, they will&#xD;
      continue to be followed for survival and subsequent anti-cancer therapy and will continue&#xD;
      follow-up for glucose-related concerns at the discretion of their endocrinologist and/or&#xD;
      medical oncologist.&#xD;
