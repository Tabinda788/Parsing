  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous contrast media is commonly used for CT scans for improved image clarity in&#xD;
      pediatric emergency medicine. Children who feel discomfort during the administration of IV&#xD;
      contrast media may not remain still during the CT scan, which affects the overall study&#xD;
      quality and reliability. Therefore, many young patients often undergo procedural sedation in&#xD;
      anticipation of movement artifact degrading the diagnostic accuracy. Procedural sedation,&#xD;
      while a common procedure in the pediatric emergency department, does have significant&#xD;
      complications, and it increases the risk of adverse events for the patient. The risk of&#xD;
      airway compromise associated with procedural sedation is particularly concerning in children&#xD;
      requiring IV contrast for imaging of an upper airway pathology such as retropharyngeal&#xD;
      abscess, as the disease itself narrows the airway. This presents the physician with a dilemma&#xD;
      of assessing the extent of the disease without the additional risk of airway compromise by&#xD;
      using procedural sedation.Previous research has looked at premedication with steroids prior&#xD;
      to IV-contrast media administration to avert an allergic response. However, there has been no&#xD;
      investigation of premedication to abate the immediate adverse effects of discomfort&#xD;
      associated with IV contrast injection. The safety of IV lidocaine in pediatric patients has&#xD;
      been documented in studies of its use for post-operative pain, using doses from 1.0 to 1.5&#xD;
      mg/kg with no known adverse side effects. CT scans with IV contrast are performed on a&#xD;
      near-daily basis in the Maimonides pediatric emergency department, usually for the assessment&#xD;
      of acute appendicitis. The standard of care in children and adults receiving IV contrast does&#xD;
      not include pre-medication to prevent IV contrast-associated discomfort. This double-blinded&#xD;
      prospective study aims to determine whether pre-treatment with lidocaine can mitigate the&#xD;
      immediate discomfort of IV contrast in verbal children and adolescents who can comply with a&#xD;
      pre and post IV contrast pain assessment.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN Subjects: Patients aged from 7 to 17 years-old who present to the Maimonides&#xD;
      Medical Center's Emergency Department that require a CT scan with IV contrast. Research team&#xD;
      members will be notified when the patient requires CT scan with IV contrast and meets the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. Potential subjects will be recruited in the Emergency Department&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion criteria: Patients with age of 7 to 17 years-old who require&#xD;
      a CT scan with IV contrast. Exclusion criteria: Patients with history of seizures,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, presenting as a trauma, a history of anaphylaxis to lidocaine, or&#xD;
      children/adolescents with underlying neurodevelopmental conditions which would interfere with&#xD;
      their ability to respond to pre and post IV contrast pain assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective, double-blinded randomized control study that will be comparing&#xD;
      intravenous lidocaine to a placebo. Patients will be randomized with block randomization. The&#xD;
      randomization list will be generated EM Research Manager and given to the EM pharmacist a&#xD;
      priori of commencement of the study. The EM Research Manager and EM Pharmacist are not&#xD;
      blinded to the study. Once a potential subject has been identified, a member of the research&#xD;
      team will obtain consent from the parent or guardian of the subject. The research team member&#xD;
      involved with consent and data collection, provider, and subject will all be blinded to which&#xD;
      treatment arm they are assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team members will monitor each patient and in conjunction with the pharmacy will&#xD;
      deliver the assigned treatment to the subject's nurse to administer 10 min prior to the CT&#xD;
      scan. If selected for the treatment group, the patient will receive a 1mg/kg IV dose of&#xD;
      lidocaine with a max dose of 40mg.15 A patient selected to the control group will an equal&#xD;
      volume of normal saline infused. A research team member will be present during the&#xD;
      administration of assigned treatment until the completion of the CT scan. The patient will be&#xD;
      placed on a cardiopulmonary monitor for the duration of this period. Advanced airway&#xD;
      equipment, IV midazolam, and IV intralipids will also be available at bedside during infusion&#xD;
      and until completion of CT scan to treat any potential adverse effect associated with&#xD;
      lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nominal variables to be collected include gender, chief complaint, pain score at triage, use&#xD;
      of pain medication at triage and during the ED course, diagnosis, type of CT scan performed,&#xD;
      pre and post-intervention pain score, post-intervention pruritus score, post-intervention&#xD;
      burning pain score. The only continuous variable being collected includes age (in years-old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no interruption or deviation from the standard of clinical care provided to&#xD;
      each subject. This study will be run completely in the Pediatric Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures: Once a subject has been enrolled, the research team member will&#xD;
      review the chart and collect all pertinent information as shown in the data collection&#xD;
      template. A questionnaire will be completed prior to administration of the medication as well&#xD;
      as following the CT scan which will be administered by the research team member. We will use&#xD;
      a combination of the Baker-Wong FACES pain scale and 1 to 10 numerical scale for pain as well&#xD;
      as a 5-point Likert scale for discomfort. Once all data has been collected, it will be&#xD;
      recorded in password protected document located on a secure server only accessible to members&#xD;
      of the research team. All information about the patients will be de-identified. Study&#xD;
      investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at prior to&#xD;
      intervention, immediately following intervention, and 15 min following the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparing ED pharmacist, research manager, and statistician will be the only ones with&#xD;
      knowledge of the study arm to which each participant would be randomized. Treating providers,&#xD;
      participants, and the data collecting research team will be blind to the medication route&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded on data collection sheets, including patients' gender,&#xD;
      demographics, medical history, and vital signs, and entered into SPSS (version 27.0; IBM&#xD;
      Corp) by the research manager. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written&#xD;
      consent acquisition for all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the&#xD;
      research manager and statistician who will work independently of any data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be closely monitored for any change in vital sings and for adverse effects&#xD;
      during the entire study period (up to 120 minutes) by study investigators.&#xD;
