  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Racial disparities result in Black infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      receiving less breast milk (BM) than White and Hispanic infants.1 BM improves infant health&#xD;
      yet mothers of critically ill infants produce insufficient amounts to provide these benefits&#xD;
      which is likely due to inadequate daily breast pumping frequency. Black mothers face unique&#xD;
      challenges to frequent breast pumping including returning to work earlier, working in&#xD;
      facilities with inadequate lactation support, and limited privacy for breast pumping at home.&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and potential&#xD;
      benefits of using a discreet, hands-free, wearable breast pump with an associated App that&#xD;
      tracks pumping frequency and BM production to increase lactation success in Black mothers of&#xD;
      infants admitted to the NICU. Specific aims include (1) evaluate the feasibility of a&#xD;
      discreet, hands-free, wearable pump in Black mothers of critically ill infants to increase&#xD;
      pumping frequency and BM production and (2) assess whether results indicate a signal of&#xD;
      effectiveness supporting a subsequent adequately powered randomized clinical trial (RCT).&#xD;
      Following delivery, 40 Black mothers of critically ill infants will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      two groups. Group 1 will be provided a discreet, hands-free, wearable breast pump with an&#xD;
      associated App and Group 2 will be provided a standard mechanical breast pump with no&#xD;
      associated App. Results will be used to revise the intervention and study processes and to&#xD;
      estimate outcome measurement variability and effect sizes needed for sample size calculations&#xD;
      for an adequately powered RCT.&#xD;
