    <textblock>
      The Diagnosis of a thoracic Aortic Aneruysms usually made when imaging an abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm which has reached threshold or as an incidental finding during a chest scan by&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these imaging&#xD;
      modalities are expensive, involve radiation exposure and can cause anaphylaxis and other&#xD;
      allergic reaction from the contract agents used. In addition CT scans are contraindicated for&#xD;
      those who have: allergic reactions to the contrast, radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid&#xD;
      disease, metformin use, and chronic or acutely worsening renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that is cheaper than the methods currently used&#xD;
      for TAA detection and surveillance. Echocardiography is limited in assessing the TAA as it is&#xD;
      not sensitive to image beyond the proximal ascending aorta which is why it is currently not&#xD;
      used for screening or surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study found that ultrasound has the potential to be used as a diagnostic modality for&#xD;
      thoracic aortic aneurysms and may have a role in surveillance in patients for whom CT&#xD;
      scanning is contraindicated. They found that the sensitivity and specificity of detecting TAA&#xD;
      was 100% and 70% for a threshold of 35 mm, and 84% and 90% for a threshold of 40 mm. However,&#xD;
      further validation of this methodology is required for it to be considered as a method of&#xD;
      diagnosis and surveillance for this patient group. This study was only carried out by one&#xD;
      experienced sonographer so it important to repeat this study to see if other sonographers are&#xD;
      able to obtain the necessary views.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to validate the protocol used by pilot study to assess&#xD;
      whether thoracic aortic aneurysms can be detected and measured accurately using ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can ultrasound be used to detect thoracic aortic aneurysms?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can ultrasound be used to accurately measure thoracic aortic aneurysms?&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results of this study show that ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      detecting thoracic aortic aneurysms, it could lead to a thoracic aorta screening programme.&#xD;

      It is important to state that patients involved in this study will not have any changes made&#xD;
      to their routine care as a result of this study. All patients recruited would have had a&#xD;
      recent CT scan which will be used for the comparison and will not be exposed to any&#xD;
      additional radiation as part of the study. The CT scan used will be from the last 3 years so&#xD;
      no new diagnoses are expected as a result of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients There will be two different groups recruited for this study; Group 1- patients with&#xD;
      known thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and Group 2- patients with known abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm (AAA) but no thoracic aortic aneurysm. The known TAA group will be obtained from&#xD;
      those who are currently having CT surveillance for either a known TAA or TEVAR (Thoracic&#xD;
      Endovascular Repair). The known AAA but no TAA will be obtained from patients who are either&#xD;
      under for CT surveillance AAA or EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair). All patients recruited&#xD;
      for this study will be under CT surveillance at Southampton General Hospital or Queen&#xD;
      Alexandra hospital and would have had a CT scan within the last 3 years at University&#xD;
      Hospital Southampton so no new findings would be expected to come from the study. In&#xD;
      addition, the CT scan used will be part of their routine care and there will be no change to&#xD;
      their routine care or surveillance as a result of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Males and Female participants will be recruited for the study and there will also be a&#xD;
      minimum age of 18 as gender will not influence the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment Any patients eligible for the study will be contacted to see if they&#xD;
      are interested in taking part and given a participant information sheet. The participant&#xD;
      information sheet (PIS) will entail the full details of the study and what it will involve&#xD;
      for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is interested in participating in the study, a telephone call appointment will&#xD;
      be arranged between a member of the research team and the patient. This phone call will&#xD;
      involve going through the PIS, answering any questions, and obtaining verbal informed&#xD;
      consent. During this appointment, an ultrasound scan appointment will also be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A referral for the scan will be placed by Ben Patterson using the hospitals e-quest system&#xD;
      under the patients hospital number so that images can be stored and a report can be generated&#xD;
      and recorded for the patients record. The referral will placed using the code UAOTD and when&#xD;
      the referral is on the CRIS system, one of the researchers will insure that the patient is&#xD;
      changed to a research scan to ensure that it does not interfere with routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the ultrasound assessment, written informed consent will be obtained prior to the scan&#xD;
      being carried out and there will also be another opportunity for patients to ask any&#xD;
      questions. If patients' are unable to consent to the study themselves as they are deemed to&#xD;
      have a lack of capacity, they will not be included within the research study and will&#xD;
      continue with their routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of demographic data Patients age and gender will be recorded for the study. No&#xD;
      other demographic information will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound scan protocol A single vascular sonographer (Hannah Davey) will complete all&#xD;
      ultrasound scans for this study and will be blinded to the CT diagnosis, location, and extent&#xD;
      of the aortic pathology in all patients. This will be achieved by a member of the research&#xD;
      team arranging the patients' appointment and having a study participant code for the scan&#xD;
      referral so that the different groups cannot be identified. The vascular sonographer will&#xD;
      also not complete any of the consenting in order to ensure they are blinded to any patient&#xD;
      identifiable information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum diameter (inner wall to inner wall) of the different areas of the thoracic aorta&#xD;
      will be measured; primarily focusing on the descending thoracic aorta from the isthmus to the&#xD;
      level of the diaphragm will be obtained and recorded for the study. The sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of detecting TAA will be test at measurements of both 35mm and 40mm&#xD;
&#xD;
      All scans of the thoracic aorta will be performed using a Philips Epiq 5 or Epiq 7 machine&#xD;
      with 2 MHz phased array transducer. The patient will lay supine on an ultrasound scan couch&#xD;
      which can be tilted in order to optimise the patient position and views required for the&#xD;
      scan. The measurements will be taken in B-mode but colour Doppler imaging may be used to&#xD;
      identify the thoracic aorta if it is obscured by artefacts. The measurement will be taken&#xD;
      inner wall to inner wall and several images will be taken to check reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different acoustic windows will be used to image the thoracic aorta:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Suprasternal window- To visualise aortic arch and the three major supra-aortic vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parasternal long axis window- To visualise the mid descending thoracic aorta&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Apical two chamber views- To visualise the distal end of the thoracic aorta and proximal&#xD;
           segment of the abdominal aorta Ultrasound assessment will be considered satisfactory&#xD;
           when at least two of the three regions of the descending thoracic aorta were visualised,&#xD;
           partially satisfactory when a single view was obtained and inconclusive when none of the&#xD;
           three windows could be obtained The ultrasound scan appointment is estimated to take&#xD;
           approximately 30 mins for obtaining written informed consent and completing the scan.&#xD;
           All images and measurements taken during the scan will be stored on PACS and a report&#xD;
           for the scan will be written on CRIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Scan protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consultant vascular surgeon (Mr B Patterson) at Southampton General Hospital will review&#xD;
      the CT scans and measure the maximum diameter (inner wall to inner wall) of the thoracic&#xD;
      aorta. He is highly experienced in imaging patients with thoracic aortic pathology so the&#xD;
      measurements will be reliable and valid. All CT scan measurements will be carried out on the&#xD;
      picture archiving systems (PACS) at Southampton General Hospital and will also be compared to&#xD;
      the measurement reported on system. Similarly to the ultrasound protocol, the maximum&#xD;
      diameter of the different areas of the thoracic aorta will be obtained and recorded for the&#xD;
      study. The diameter used for the study will be measured inner wall to inner wall in order to&#xD;
      allow for comparison and accuracy to the ultrasound scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CT scan used for the measurement will be taken from the most recent aorta scan on the&#xD;
      CRIS and PACS systems at Southampton General Hospital or Queen Alexandra Hospital. Patients&#xD;
      will not be having any additional scans as part of this study and measurements will only be&#xD;
      used from scans as part of their routine care. This is in order to minimise the amount of&#xD;
      radiation each patient is exposed too and to make sure that their routine care is not&#xD;
      interrupted by them participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images from both the ultrasound scan and CT scan will be stored on a Picture archiving and&#xD;
      communication system (PACS). Measurements of the maximum diameter for the ultrasound scan&#xD;
      will be completed at the time scan and will be done using the measurement software in the&#xD;
      ultrasound machine. The CT scan measurements will be carried out on the PACS system and will&#xD;
      be compared to the value reported in the original report to check the accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements from both the ultrasound and CT scan will be recorded on Microsoft Excel. For&#xD;
      each group, mean and standard deviation will be calculated. The sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of the ultrasound scan will be analysed using cut-off points of both 35mm and 40mm. This will&#xD;
      be done using the CT scan measurement as a reference for comparing the accuracy of the&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement. Statistical analysis will be carried out on Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (SPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound, a Clopper-Pearson&#xD;
      confidence interval will be carried out on Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS). The statistical analysis will be completed with a 95% confidence interval and will be&#xD;
      calculated at both 35mm and 40mm cut-offs.&#xD;
