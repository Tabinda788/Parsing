      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open label, interventional basket trial to evaluate&#xD;
      autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) infusion followed by IL-2 after a&#xD;
      non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion preparation for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic refractory gynecological cancer including cervical, ovarian,&#xD;
      endometrial and breast carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) infusion is highly personalized cancer&#xD;
      immunotherapy with strong anti-tumor efficacy and tumor specificity. TILs were extracted from&#xD;
      autologous fresh tumor tissues, and after ex vivo stimulation, activation and extensive&#xD;
      expansion, are reinfused to patients. TIL-based therapies have only been offered in small&#xD;
      phase I/II studies in a few centers and revealed a high objective response rate (ORR) in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic, recurrent or advanced melanoma, non-small cell long carcinoma and&#xD;
      cervical carcinoma. However, the efficacy of TIL-based therapies still needs more clinical&#xD;
      trials to prove. In this proposal, a one-arm, open, multicenter, phaseⅠ/Ⅱ trial was designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in treatment&#xD;
      of patients with advanced or metastatic refractory gynecological cancer including cervical,&#xD;
      ovarian, endometrial and breast carcinoma.&#xD;
