    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of the ADAM System for implantation into&#xD;
      the vas deferens in 25 healthy males at 2 sites. This is a prospective, non-randomized, open&#xD;
      label interventional trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two cohorts to monitor safety in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: The first 10 subjects will be reviewed for safety by a Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
           Board (DSMB) at 30 days post-implantation. The 10 subjects will then be followed up to&#xD;
           36 months or until the average of two semen analyses is ≥ 15 million sperm/mL (the&#xD;
           duration between collection of both specimens is ≥2 days and ≤7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: An additional 15 subjects will be enrolled and implanted with ADAM after the&#xD;
           DSMB Safety Review of the first 10 subjects at 30 days. They will be followed up to 36&#xD;
           months or until the average of two semen analyses is ≥ 15 million sperm/mL (the duration&#xD;
           between collection of both specimens is ≥2 days and ≤7 days).&#xD;

    <description>The ADAM System consists of an injectable hydrogel and delivery apparatus that is intended to provide long-lasting, non-permanent vasal occlusion for men, resulting in azoospermia. ADAM is designed to be inserted into the vasa deferentia through a minimally invasive procedure, similar to the no-scalpel vasectomy.</description>

&#xD;
          3. Subject has a normal semen analysis (≥ 15 million sperm/mL, ≥40% total motility)&#xD;
             defined by the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen&#xD;
             (5th Edition), based on the average of two semen samples ≥2 days and ≤7 days apart&#xD;

&#xD;
               7. Subject currently taking or planning to take any type of systemic medication&#xD;
                  which could affect sperm count or ejaculation (e.g., anabolic steroids,&#xD;
                  chemotherapy, alpha blocker)&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Subject had a previous successful or unsuccessful vasectomy or vasectomy reversal&#xD;
&#xD;
