  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, research efforts have focused on interventions such as collagen&#xD;
      supplementation as an alternative treatment for pain and physical function in patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Hydrolyzed collagen (HC) is a mixture of collagen peptides with a molecular&#xD;
      weight of less than 5,000 Da. It is obtained from the gelatinization and subsequent enzymatic&#xD;
      hydrolysis of native collagen from animal tissues rich in this protein. In this line, several&#xD;
      studies show that HC is more easily absorbed enzymatically, has a higher bioavailability, is&#xD;
      distributed to joint tissues, and has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties,&#xD;
      consistently showing symptom-relieving effects, thus improving joint function and reducing&#xD;
      joint pain, as well as optimizing the patient's quality of life. In this randomized pilot&#xD;
      study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effect on pain and other parameters related to&#xD;
      physical function of an oral dietary HC supplement composed of lemon flavoring, anhydrous&#xD;
      citric acid (acidifier), calcium ascorbate (vitamin C), sucralose (sweetener) and stevia&#xD;
      (sweetener). A 10.728 g dose provides 10 g of HC and 80 mg of vitamin C. Each placebo packet&#xD;
      contained sucralose (sweetener) and stevia (sweetener) in identical proportions to the active&#xD;
      preparation. Both the active and the placebo were manufactured by NutraResearchÂ© SL&#xD;
      (Barcelona, Spain) under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).&#xD;
