    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome-CoV-2 in unvaccinated sickle cell patients living in an area with high viral&#xD;
      circulation and at risk of high viral transmission, after the 4th epidemic wave of COVID-19&#xD;
      in Ile-de -France, over a period of 3 months (for example, last quarter of 2021).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is a very widespread genetic disease affecting 300,000 births worldwide,&#xD;
      with a prevalence of one affected child for 1736 births in France, the most common genetic&#xD;
      disease in France. France is the European country with the highest prevalence of the disease&#xD;
      while Ile-de-France is the region with the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease and&#xD;
      COVID-19. The medical management of sickle cell patients raises many challenges related to&#xD;
      the complexity of their disease and the comorbidities that may be associated with their&#xD;
      conditions (arterial hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension, nephropathy and renal&#xD;
      failure, cerebral vasculopathy).Our seroprevalence study will focus on the sickle cell&#xD;
      population living in an area with high circulation of severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome-CoV-2; it will start after the 4th epidemic wave of COVID-19 during the vaccination&#xD;
      campaigns, in order to collect on the one hand seroprevalence data (proportion of&#xD;
      unvaccinated seropositive sickle cell patients) and persistence of humoral immunity&#xD;
      (quantitative) after infection in unvaccinated subjects and on the other hand, to assess the&#xD;
      vaccination coverage in this specific population (adults and adolescents) as well as its&#xD;
      impact (occurrence of vaccine failures).&#xD;
