  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies in mice demonstrated that dietary phosphate (Pi) loading that mimic the level of US&#xD;
      adult consumption leads to reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, exercise capacity, and&#xD;
      reduced resting metabolic rate when in normal mice by impairing skeletal muscle mitochondrial&#xD;
      function and fat oxidation. However, relevance of this findings in humans remains unknown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a randomized, crossover study to determine if lowering dietary&#xD;
      Pi intake from 1,200 mg/day to recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 700 mg/day increases&#xD;
      skeletal muscle ATP synthesis, raises exercise oxygen uptake (VO2) during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      testing. To ensure stable Pi intake prior to randomization, Pi consumption will be estimated&#xD;
      by food recall during a run-in and washout phase for 2 consecutive days, using the Automated&#xD;
      Self-Administered 24-Hour (ASA24Â®) Dietary Assessment Tool&#xD;
      (https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/). After the run-in period, all participants will be&#xD;
      maintained on a low Pi diet (700 mg/d) and a low Na diet of approximately 1,930 mg/d&#xD;
      throughout the study for 8 weeks. Subjects will also be randomized to receive Sodium&#xD;
      Phosphate 2 capsules daily (containing a total of 500 mg of Pi, 372mg of sodium) for 4 weeks&#xD;
      during the high Pi phase (total Pi intake 1,200 mg/d) vs 2 capsules of Sodium Chloride (NaCl,&#xD;
      containing a total of 372mg of sodium) to match Na content to Sodium Phosphate without extra&#xD;
      Pi daily for 4 weeks during the low Pi phase (total Pi intake = 700 mg/d). The total Na&#xD;
      intake during the entire study will be at recommended level of 2,300 mg/d. Investigational&#xD;
      drug service at UT Southwestern will dispense Sodium Phosphate vs. NaCl tablets and the study&#xD;
      subjects will be blinded to the type of supplement they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the periods of high and low Pi phases, the investigators will monitor 24-hr urinary Pi&#xD;
      excretion (UPiV) to ensure adherence. Since approximately 70% of ingested Pi is absorbed and&#xD;
      excreted in the urine, we expect 24-hr UPiV excretion to be approximately 840 mg during the&#xD;
      high Pi phase and 490 mg during the low Pi phase. If 24-hr UPiV is &lt; 800 mg during the high&#xD;
      Pi diet or &gt; 500 mg during the low Pi diet, the research dietitian will provide additional&#xD;
      counseling to improve adherence to the menu plan. If needed, the research diet will be&#xD;
      altered to be more compatible with the participant's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-hr urinary Pi, Na, K, Cr, and Ca excretion will be assessed after weeks 2 and 4 of the low&#xD;
      and high Pi phases. Serum electrolytes and Pi will be monitored every 2 weeks. Serum FGF23,&#xD;
      and soluble Klotho levels and cardiopulmonary testing and P31 MRS of quadriceps muscle will&#xD;
      be obtained after 4 weeks on the study diet. The order of study supplement will be&#xD;
      randomized. Subsequently, participants will stop the first study supplement and undergo&#xD;
      washout for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of washout, they will receive the 2nd study supplement.&#xD;
      Measurement of skeletal muscle ATP synthesis and VO2 at rest and during exercise will be&#xD;
      repeated in the same fashion.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>oxygen uptake (VO2) during peak exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VO2 (ml of oxygen consumed /min) will be measured using a metabolic cart (Medgraphics) during exercise in a stationary bicycle. Standard breath-by-breath respiratory gases (VO2) will be measured at rest and after 3 minutes of steady state exercise at both 20 and 40 Watts using a cycle ergometer (Lode). Then, the partcipants will be asked to perform exercise to maximal level to obtain peak VO2.</description>

    <measure>Resting ATP synthesis</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Resting ATP synthesis (mM/min) will be measured using a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The rate of exchange of high energy phosphates between phosphocreatine and ATP will be used to calculate resting ATP synthesis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phosphocreatine (PCr) depletion</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PCr depletion (%) will be measured in the calf muscle after measurements of resting ATP synthesis by MRS. Participants will be asked to perform plantar flexion exercise for 1 min of foot-pushing against a magnet-compatible pulley system mounted on the scanner table constant workload (20% of estimated lean body weight at 2 s/cycle, 1 second of contraction/1 second of relaxation). Two bouts of exercise are performed by each subject with 10 min recovery between each bout and the results are averaged.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VO2 (ml of oxygen consumed /min) will be measured using a metabolic cart (Medgraphics) during exercise in a stationary bicycle. Standard breath-by-breath respiratory gases (VO2) will be measured at rest and after 3 minutes of steady state exercise at both 20 and 40 Watts using a cycle ergometer (Lode) to obtain levels of sub maximal oxygen uptake</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac output (CO)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CO (ml/min) will be measured at rest and during the same stationary bicycle exercise while VO2 is monitored, using an inert gas rebreathing method. The Innocor rebreathing system (Innovision A/S, Odense, Denmark) uses a combination of both an inert soluble gas (0.5% nitrous oxide) and an inert insoluble gas (0.1% sulfur hexafluoride) and has been shown to provide a reliable assessment of lung volumes and cardiac output non-invasively.</description>
