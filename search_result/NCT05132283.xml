      This research study involves the use of two navigation systems, the 3D Slicer-based&#xD;
      navigation system, and the Siemens Monaco systems, which will simplify the complexity of&#xD;
      image-guided lymphadenectomy procedures (surgery to remove one or more lymph nodes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the navigation systems (3D&#xD;
      Slicer and Monaco) as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, our hypothesis is that the use of the navigation systems (3D Slicer&#xD;
      and the Siemens Monaco system) may simplify the complexity of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      (The procedure in which a small incision is made in the lower abdomen to reach the lymph&#xD;
      nodes) in regions of urologic interest, by resulting in better visualization and more&#xD;
      accurate localization of the diseased lymph node and allowing for improved surgical and&#xD;
      patient outcomes, fewer complications, and better clinician performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of our program is to demonstrate that the navigation system (3D Slicer and&#xD;
      the Siemens Monaco system) increase the efficiency and reduce the morbidity or the likelihood&#xD;
      of any medical problems associated with the resection or removal of radiologically defined&#xD;
      lesions, within urologic regions of interest, associated with any type of urologic cancer.&#xD;
      The first clinical application of the system will be in resecting radiologically positive&#xD;
      lymph nodes displayed by CT or FDG PET (an imaging test used to identify lymphomas and other&#xD;
      cancers) in the Advanced Multimodality Image-Guided Operating (AMIGO) Suite at Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital (BWH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The navigation system has been used with similar protocols, specifically 5 parathyroid&#xD;
      surgeries, 13 tracked endoscopic ultrasound (minimally invasive procedure to assess digestive&#xD;
      and lung diseases) and over 30 tracked colonoscopy experiments (exam used to detect changes&#xD;
      or abnormalities in the large intestine (colon) and rectum) on human subjects at BWH with no&#xD;
      difficulties or reportable incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take you up to 4 weeks to complete this study. During that time you will have two&#xD;
      study visits and one standard of care follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and standard of care follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of Patients Completing Intended Procedure (Feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month, up to 45 days after registration</time_frame>
    <description>The Slicer-Monaco prototype navigation platform will be used to resect enlarged and/or fluorodeoxyglucose avid lymph nodes. The successful navigational use of this platform will be considered as completed. The proportion of patients completing this intended procedure will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients with Laparoscopic Videos Recorded</measure>
    <time_frame>One month, up to 45 days from registration</time_frame>
    <description>During the first phase of the project on 10 patients, we will store real-time laparoscopic videos using the KARL STORZ 3D Video system that can be analyzed offline. During the second phase of 10 patients, we will provide an optional video overlay option in the navigation system. The navigation system will be similar to that used on the first 10 patients. The only difference will be that the virtual endoscopy view will be overlaid on the laparoscopy video in the 3D Slicer navigation system.</description>

    <measure>Velocity Kinematic Metric</measure>
    <time_frame>One month, up to 45 days after registration</time_frame>

    <measure>Acceleration Kinematic Metric</measure>
    <time_frame>One month, up to 45 days after registration</time_frame>

    <measure>Jerk Kinematic Metric</measure>
    <time_frame>One month, up to 45 days after registration</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental/Physical/Temporal Demand on Physician</measure>
    <time_frame>One month, up to 45 days after registration</time_frame>
    <description>The mental, physical and temporal demand on physicians will be assessed using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), a multidimensional assessment tool that rates perceived workload in order to assess the performance of a task. The NASA task load index has a scoring range of 1 to 10 for mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, effort, and frustration with 1 representing a very low value and 10 representing a very high value. A mean score out of 10 will be given for each operation and a mean score for all 20 operations will be given (out of 10). Assessment will be filled out by investigators.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean absolute difference in distance from Instruments to Organs</measure>
    <time_frame>One month, up to 45 days after registration</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of localization of the organs will be quantified by pointing to specific structures and evaluating the distance of the registered instrument from the structures in the image space.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Further, the pathology of the lymph node resected using the navigation system will be compared to the other lymph nodes resected in urologic regions of interest.</measure>
    <time_frame>One month, up to 45 days after registration</time_frame>
    <description>To ensure quality control of the procedure, the lymph node removed with the navigation system will be compared to the other lymph nodes resected in urologic regions of interest without the use of the navigation system.&#xD;
The unit of measure will be the accuracy of targeting the PET-avid lymph node as confirmed by pathology, i.e., binary decision variable for two categories (using the navigation system or not). Using the navigation system: malignant or not, versus not using with the navigation system: malignant or not. The measurement tool will be the pathological analysis.</description>
