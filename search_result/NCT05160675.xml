  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish the longitudinal microbiome and bone trajectories from&#xD;
      birth to 3 years, and to evaluate the influence of nutrition on these trajectories.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to understand the influence of nutrition and dietary&#xD;
      patterns on microbiome and bone trajectories during early life. Specific research objectives&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the reference trajectories of gut microbiome maturation index and bone&#xD;
           development in healthy Chinese children aged 0-3years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of early life nutrition on gut microbiome trajectory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the influence of microbiome, early life parameters and nutritional&#xD;
           parameters on bone health&#xD;
