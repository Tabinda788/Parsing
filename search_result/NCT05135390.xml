      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. About 310&#xD;
      maintenance hemodialysis patients with moderate or above chronic kidney disease-associated&#xD;
      pruritus are planned to be enrolled. They will randomized into the treatment group (HSK21542,&#xD;
      0.3 μg/kg) and the control group (placebo) at a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of subjects with an improvement of ≥ 3 points from baseline in the weekly average of the daily Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) after 12 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>In the NRS score, 0-10 represents different degrees of itching, the larger the number, the more severe the itching</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in subjects' quality of life (evaluated using the Skindex-16 scale ) after 12 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Skindex-16 Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past week. The questions cover 3 domains: symptoms, emotions, and functioning domain. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in subjects' quality of life (evaluated using the 5-D itch scale) after 12 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D Itch Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past 2 weeks. The questions cover five dimensions of itch including the degree, duration of itch/day, direction (improvement/worsening), disability (impact on activities such as work), and body distribution of itch. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>
