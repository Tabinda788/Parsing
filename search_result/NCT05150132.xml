  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that interactive power toothbrushes (PTBs), developed in recent years,&#xD;
      provide more successful results in plaque control and effective use of brushing time by&#xD;
      enabling patient collaboration and self-treatment, thanks to the application features&#xD;
      associated with mobile phones. Interactive PTB synchronized with smartphones, including&#xD;
      real-time feedback, session length, applications that prevent excessive brushing force, and&#xD;
      focus brushing on specific areas with position detection technology, increases the brushing&#xD;
      performance by increasing oral hygiene motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies report that both power and manual toothbrushes cause gingival abrasion, a localized&#xD;
      reversible lesion of the epithelium. While the opinions about the cause of gingival abrasion&#xD;
      are not clear yet, the discussions regarding brush strength yet continue. While it is&#xD;
      possible to control the interactive PTB force thanks to the mobile application, it is known&#xD;
      that these high-speed rotating brushes control plaque effectively, but there is not enough&#xD;
      evidence about its effect on gingival abrasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this clinical study is to determine whether interactive power&#xD;
      toothbrush with application feature provides an additional benefit on plaque removal efficacy&#xD;
      and reduction of gingival inflammation. In addition, this study aims to determine the effect&#xD;
      of interactive power toothbrush with application on gingival abrasion by comparing it to&#xD;
      interactive power toothbrush without application and manual toothbrush. The study's null&#xD;
      hypothesis in terms of gingival abrasion is that interactive power toothbrushes do not show a&#xD;
      significant difference from other brushing methods.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth surfaces stained with Mira-2 Toneblue® were evaluated with six different scores: Score 0 = No plaque, Score 1 = Plaque stains on the cervical edge of the tooth, Score 2 = A thin, continuous strip of plaque (up to 1 mm) at the cervical edge of the tooth, Score 3 = band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than one-third of the dental crown, Score 4 = Plaque covering at least one-third but less than two-thirds of the dental crown, Score 5 = Plaque covering two-thirds or more of the dental crown.</description>

    <description>The presence/absence and amount of bleeding were graded on a 0-2 scale within 30 seconds of probing by probing the gingival margin at an angle of approximately 60 to the long axis of the tooth (0 = no bleeding, 1 = punctate bleeding, 2 = excessive bleeding).</description>

    <description>The records in PTB group without-app and MTB were obtained with digital timer. In contrast, these records were obtained at the last appointment of the study; in Group PTB-A, the last brushing time records were sent to the researcher via e-mail by using the integral timer of the toothbrush, which is a feature of the mobile application.</description>
