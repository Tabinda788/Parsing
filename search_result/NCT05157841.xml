      The study is conducted sequentially in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: The purpose is to obtain information on PK profile, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and to assess the performance of 266 mg EXPAREL vs 133 mg EXPAREL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the preferred dosage of EXPAREL&#xD;
      from Part A compared with bupivacaine HCl.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active controlled study in&#xD;
      approximately 180 subjects undergoing bunionectomy. The study will be conducted in two parts&#xD;
      (Part A and Part B). Part A will be completed and analyzed before enrollment in Part B is&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be screened up to 45 days prior to the day of surgery but eligibility must be&#xD;
      re-confirmed on the day of surgery prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following screening procedures will be performed after the ICF is signed (if not standard&#xD;
      of care): assess eligibility, record medical/surgical history, record prior and concomitant&#xD;
      medications, record demographics and baseline characteristics, record subject height and&#xD;
      weight for body mass index (BMI) calculation, assess chronic opioid use in the past 30 days,&#xD;
      conduct urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, perform 12-lead EKG, record&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAEs) starting when the ICF is signed, and record medications for&#xD;
      treatment of SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, prior to sciatic nerve block, study staff will review Pain Rating Guide with the&#xD;
      subject and record their responses to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NRS score on the worst pain of their operative foot in the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NRS score on the average pain of their operative foot in the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will enroll approximately 60 subjects undergoing bunionectomy into 1 of 3 arms. They&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1:1 to either EXPAREL 266 mg, EXPAREL 133 mg, or 0.25% bupivacaine HCl&#xD;
      (50mg). Part A subjects will be asked to perform sensory function assessments, perform motor&#xD;
      function assessments and obtain PK samples. Based on the findings of the interim analysis&#xD;
      after completion of Part A, the study may stop for futility or proceed to Part B. Part B is a&#xD;
      2-arm study with 120 subjects being randomized 1:1 to either the better performing dosage of&#xD;
      EXPAREL from Part A (266mg or 133mg) or 0.25% bupivacaine HCl (50mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects will receive Celecoxib 200 mg, orally (PO) pre-operatively within four&#xD;
      hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: On Day 1, Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive a sciatic (in the popliteal&#xD;
      fossa) nerve block with a single dose of either: EXPAREL 266 mg, EXPAREL 133 mg, or 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine HCl (50 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: will continue enrolling with one of the EXPAREL arms (EXPAREL 266 mg arm or EXPAREL&#xD;
      133 mg arm) and the bupivacaine HCl arm. Therefore, the EXPAREL study arm that fails to show&#xD;
      efficacy (conditional power less than 30% in the Part A analysis) will be dropped and the&#xD;
      study will continue with two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the conditional power of one EXPAREL arm is less than 30% and the other EXPAREL arm&#xD;
           is greater than or equal to 30%:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The EXPAREL arm with conditional power less than 30% will be dropped in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If both EXPAREL arms have a conditional power greater than or equal to 30%:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the conditional power of the 266 mg EXPAREL arm is more than 10% greater than&#xD;
                the conditional power of the 133 mg EXPAREL arm, then the 266 mg EXPAREL arm will&#xD;
                be kept and the 133 mg EXPAREL arm will be dropped. Otherwise, the 133 mg EXPAREL&#xD;
                arm will be kept and the 266 mg EXPAREL arm will be dropped in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the conditional power of both treatment arms is less than 30%:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study will stop for futility&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The final analysis will include subjects from both Part A and Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a dose of 1000 mg of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen at the time of&#xD;
      surgical incision. All subjects will receive one post-operative dose of 1000 mg IV&#xD;
      acetaminophen, administered approximately 8 hours after the first dose (approximately 8 hours&#xD;
      after incision). The maximum total dose will not exceed 2000 mg. No additional acetaminophen&#xD;
      is permitted after the second IV acetaminophen dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications will be administered on an as needed (PRN) basis; opioids should not be given on&#xD;
      a predetermined schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 96 hours, the analgesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually as deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the physician responsible for postsurgical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NRS Pain intensity scores (for pain experiencing in operative foot right now, for the worst&#xD;
      pain experienced in the operative foot in the last 24 hours, and for the average pain in the&#xD;
      operative foot in the last 24 hours) will be asked from the end of surgery to 96 hours&#xD;
      post-surgery at designated timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Part A and Part B will be discharged after the completion of the 168h and 96h&#xD;
      assessments, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medication use, a follow-up phone call will&#xD;
      be made on POD 14 (Â±3 days).&#xD;

Additionally, efforts will be made to prevent the subject from observing the study drug syringe. Staff members conducting study-specific, postsurgical assessments and the subjects will remain blinded to the assigned treatment throughout the study in part by not being present during the administration of the nerve block.
