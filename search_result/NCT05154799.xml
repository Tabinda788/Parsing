  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) corresponds to a clumsiness, a slowness and an&#xD;
      inaccuracy of motor performance. This neurodevelopmental disorder affects 6% of school-aged&#xD;
      children, and disturbs daily life activities and academic performances. The etiology of DCD&#xD;
      is still unknown. An understanding of this disorder is necessary to improve interventions and&#xD;
      therefore quality of life of these people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A deficit of the so-called internal models is the most commonly described hypothesis of DCD.&#xD;
      Indeed, children with DCD exhibit difficulties in predictive control. Internal models, useful&#xD;
      for motor control, are closely related to the sensory system, as they are elaborated on and&#xD;
      constantly fed by sensory feedback. Deficits in sensory performance are described in DCD,&#xD;
      mostly in the visual system, which could in turn partly explain poor motor performance.&#xD;
      However, visuo-perceptual deficits cannot explain the entire motor difficulties because some&#xD;
      activities in daily life, as buttoning a shirt, are often performed without visual control.&#xD;
      Although the integrity of proprioceptive and tactile systems is necessary for the building of&#xD;
      internal models, and therefore for a stable motor control, these sensory systems have been&#xD;
      very little investigated in DCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, using a tool is often disturbed in children with DCD. In neurotypical subjects,&#xD;
      tool use induces a plasticity of body representation, as reflected by modifications of&#xD;
      movement kinematics after tool use. Proprioceptive abilities are necessary for this update of&#xD;
      the body schema. Thus, potential deficits of the proprioceptive system in children with DCD&#xD;
      could impair the plastic modification of the body schema, and hence of motor performance,&#xD;
      when using a tool. The aim of this study is to identify the main cause of the DCD, both by&#xD;
      evaluating the tactile and proprioceptive abilities and by assessing the body schema updating&#xD;
      abilities in children with DCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While some daily life activities improve with age, some motor difficulties persist in adults&#xD;
      with DCD. To our knowledge, perceptual abilities have never been investigated in adults with&#xD;
      DCD and it is thus unknown whether perceptual deficits are still present in adulthood. This&#xD;
      information could allow us to understand if motor difficulties in adult DCD are caused by&#xD;
      enduring perceptual deficits and/or impaired plasticity of body schema. The second aim of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate abilities of perception and of body schema plasticity in adults&#xD;
      with DCD.&#xD;

    <description>Difference in localization error distance between manual response and ocular response: measure in mm between the target and the response of the subject.&#xD;
Task 1 : proprioceptive localization with manual response Task 2 : proprioceptive localization with ocular response Task 3: tactile localization with manual response Task 4: tactile localization with ocular response&#xD;
In the 4 tests, we will measure the deviation (in mm) between the localization response of the subject and the reference point.&#xD;
For tasks 1 and 2, the reference point is the position of the hidden index finger of the subject.&#xD;
For tasks 3 and 4, the reference point is the position of the tactile stimulation applied to the hidden arm of the subject.&#xD;
For the manual response, the subject must designate with his other index finger where he considers the target to be.&#xD;
For the ocular saccadic response, the subject must shift his gaze and look where he considers the target to be.</description>

    <description>In the first part of the study, the subject must designate a target in 2 ways: manual pointing or ocular saccadic response.&#xD;
In the second part of the study the subject will have to reach and grasp a rectangular block of wood placed on the table at a distance of 35 cm. He will have to catch the wooden block, lift it a few centimeters and put it back on the table. Tool use and control phases: the subject grasps the wooden block with a tool or without the tool but with a weighted bracelet loading his wrist by the same amount as the tool.</description>
