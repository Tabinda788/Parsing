    <description>In this pilot study, 15 patients age 18-75 with multiple myeloma will be admitted to the hospital and treated with a single dose of high dose melphalan. Stem cell infusion will occur per institutional standard of care. Patients will then receive plinabulin 40mg flat dose IV infusion, infused over approximately 30 minutes starting between 1-3 hours after stem cell infusion on day 0. Pegfilgrastim 6mg will be administered as per standard of care on day +1.</description>
