      Introduction: Although PACIFIC regimen definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed&#xD;
      by Durvalumab consolidation therapy is considered the standard of care for most of stage III&#xD;
      NSCLC patients, neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy followed by surgery has&#xD;
      shown the trend to be considered for some potentially resectable patients. The rationales for&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment are tumor regression effect before surgery, early eradication of&#xD;
      micrometastasis. Recently the investigators also find some clinical trials exploring the&#xD;
      adding of 45 Gy in 25 fractions radiation to the combination of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      immunotherapy neoadjuvant therapy and the investigators could see the safety is the most&#xD;
      concern, especially the pneumonitis incidence. Low dose radiation could help control the&#xD;
      toxicity induced by radiation and has synergic effect with immunotherapy. The aim of this&#xD;
      phase Ib study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the combination of the concurrent&#xD;
      low dose radiation, chemotherapy and Durvalumab neoadjuvant therapy, to explore which&#xD;
      radiation dose is the best among our three-dose designs and evaluate if the combining&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy could further improve MPR in the meantime no severe toxicities especially&#xD;
      the grade 3-4 pneumonitis would happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: 9 eligible patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC (potentially resectable&#xD;
      clinical stage III according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th staging system)&#xD;
      are enrolled. Patients receive Chemo (Day1 and 22 nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel 260&#xD;
      mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 5 ) and durvalumab (Day 1 and 22, 1500mg) and radiotherapy of 10 Gy&#xD;
      in 5 fractions, 20 Gy in 10 fractions, 30 Gy in 15 fractions respectively in our three groups&#xD;
      from Day1, followed by surgery. After surgery, patients are suggested to be treated with&#xD;
      durvalumab for one year (every 4weeks, 1500 mg). The primary endpoints are safety and&#xD;
      tolerability. The secondary endpoints are objective response rate (ORR), event-free survival&#xD;
      EFS), overall survival (OS), pathologic complete response (pCR), and major pathologic&#xD;
      response(MPR) in the primary tumor. biomarker analysis of PD-L1 using cancer tissue and LIPI,&#xD;
      ctDNA using blood sample will be conducted pre-and post- neoadjuvant and post-surgery.&#xD;
