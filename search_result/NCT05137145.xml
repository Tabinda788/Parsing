  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common reason of poor bowel preparation, which negatively influences the&#xD;
      quality of colonoscopy. Clinically to explore more effective and tolerant bowel clearance&#xD;
      programs is necessary for patients with chronic constipation.&#xD;

      Colonoscopy is an important method to screen, diagnose and treat colon lesions. The quality&#xD;
      of bowel preparation is requisite for the accuracy of diagnosis and safety of treatment. To&#xD;
      explore the application effect and safety of Linaclotide combined with Compound Polyethylene&#xD;
      Glycol Electrolyte Powder on colon cleansing before colonoscopy in patients with chronic&#xD;
      constipation. A prospective mult-centers, colonoscopist-blinded study was conducted. A total&#xD;
      of 300 patients with constipation who underwent colonoscopy in 8 hospitals from July to&#xD;
      December 2021 were selected as study subjects and divided into the control group, observation&#xD;
      group 1, observation group 2 and observation group 3 by random number table method, with 75&#xD;
      cases in each group. Intestinal cleanliness and the incidence of adverse reactions of&#xD;
      patients in each group were compared.&#xD;
