  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical intervention is a planned or unplanned procedure performed to eliminate the existing&#xD;
      or subsequent abnormal conditions in the individual's body, to reduce the effects of these&#xD;
      conditions, or to remove the abnormal structures from the individual's body to eliminate the&#xD;
      existing distress. While surgical interventions also cause anxiety in patients, it is known&#xD;
      that they also cause significant anxiety in patients' relatives.This study was planned as a&#xD;
      randomized controlled experimental study in order to examine the effect of this information&#xD;
      on the anxiety level of the relatives of the patients by informing the relatives of the&#xD;
      patients about the operation process with a short message during cardiovascular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In data collection; Introductory information form for the patient and patient relatives, a&#xD;
      short message follow-up form, state and trait anxiety inventory will be used during the&#xD;
      surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of the study will be the relatives of the patients who are willing to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Considering the change in the state anxiety scale scores between the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups in the study of Baydemir S. (2019), it is calculated that&#xD;
      there is a large effect size difference. Based on this finding, in order to test a large&#xD;
      effect size (d=0.8) difference in anxiety scale scores of patient relatives between our&#xD;
      experimental and control groups with 5% margin of error and 95% power, a total of 84&#xD;
      relatives of patients, 42 from each group, were included in the study. needed was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Informing by text message has no effect on the anxiety of patient relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Informing by text message has an effect on the anxiety of patient relatives.&#xD;
