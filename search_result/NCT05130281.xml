  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine different ways of motivating people to make use of Maya, a mobile&#xD;
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program for adolescents and young adults experiencing&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, and to assess whether social supports are as efficacious, or more&#xD;
      efficacious, than other non-monetary incentives. Subjects will use the Maya app for at least&#xD;
      20 minutes per day, 2 days per week, for 6 weeks. Assessments will include a weekly check in&#xD;
      with a member of the research team, questionnaires, and an optional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) recording.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is a growing need for easily accessed anxiety treatments designed for young adults.&#xD;
      Mobile app-based interventions can be disseminated more broadly than traditional psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions and may be particularly appealing to this age group, which uses mobile devices&#xD;
      frequently. Mobile apps can also collect real-time data about patient symptom severity and&#xD;
      provide tailored, in-the-moment coping strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine different ways of motivating people to make use of Maya, a mobile&#xD;
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) app for adolescents and young adults experiencing anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms, and to assess whether social supports are as efficacious, or more efficacious, than&#xD;
      other non-monetary incentives. Young adults with anxiety will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      conditions: a social support condition, a gain-framed condition in which participants can&#xD;
      earn &quot;points&quot; for completing their assigned sessions, and a loss-framed condition in which&#xD;
      participants lose &quot;points&quot; for failing to complete their assigned sessions. Subjects will use&#xD;
      the Maya app for at least 20 minutes per day, 2 days per week, for 6 weeks and will complete&#xD;
      assessments at baseline, week 3, week 6 (end of treatment), and a follow-up assessment at&#xD;
      week 12. Subjects may also choose to complete an optional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      recording at the baseline and end of treatment (week 6).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized clinical trial designed to assess the feasibility of Maya, an app-based CBT intervention, and provide preliminary efficacy data for three different incentive strategies. Participants will be randomized to one of three incentive conditions: 1) a social support condition, 2) a gain-framed condition in which participants can earn &quot;points&quot; for completing assigned therapy sessions, and 3) a loss-framed condition in which participants begin with a specified number of points that they can lose for failing to complete assigned therapy sessions on time.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 6 (end of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in anxiety between the three incentive conditions will be measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), a 14-item questionnaire measure of the severity of anxiety symptoms. The items measure both psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety, where higher scores, defined by a score range of 18-56, indicate a greater presence of symptoms and lower scores, defined by a score range of 0-17, indicate mild to no anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 6 (end of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in anxiety between the three incentive conditions will be measured using the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI). The ASI is an 18-item scale containing three subscales measuring physical, cognitive, and social concerns regarding anxiety. Higher scores, defined by a score range of 18-72, reflect greater self-reported concern and lower scores, defined by a score range of 0-17, reflect little self-reported concern.</description>

    <description>Change in anxiety between the three incentive conditions will be measured using the the Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). The LSAS is a 24-item scale measuring fear and avoidance across social situations. Higher scores, defined by a score range of 50-95 or greater, indicate greater fear and avoidance severity and lower scores, defined by a score range of 0-49, indicate mild to no fear or avoidance.</description>

    <measure>Number of sessions completed</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention (week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of sessions completed in the mobile app over the course of treatment will be totaled. A greater number of sessions completed over the course of treatment will indicate greater engagement.</description>

    <measure>Mean rating score on the Mobile Application Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention (week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Average of all three rating score on the uMARS throughout the intervention (average of week 1, 3, and 6) for each participant. The Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS) is a 26-item measure of mobile application engagement, functionality, aesthetics, quality of information, and perceived impact. Higher scores, defined by a mean score of 4 or greater, indicate greater application feasibility and lower scores, defined by a mean score of 3 or lower, indicate poorer application feasibility.</description>

Participants can identify a person they know to receive updates about their progress and support them throughout their time in the program. Participants will not be required to choose a person they know to receive updates about their use of the program; instead, they can choose to have a member of the study team serve as their social support if they are assigned to this condition.</description>
