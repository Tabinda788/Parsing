  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a retrospective observational claims data study of commercial and Medicare&#xD;
      Advantage with Part D (MAPD) patients initiating fingolimod.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study sample comprised commercial and MAPD enrollees who initiated fingolimod treatment&#xD;
      during the identification period of 01 January 2012 through 10 May 2018. The date of the&#xD;
      first fingolimod pharmacy claim during the identification period was the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were continuously enrolled in the health plan for 24 months. The 6-month&#xD;
      pre-index period, ending the day before the index date, was used to assess patients' clinical&#xD;
      characteristics (e.g., comorbid conditions and MS symptoms). The 18-month post-index period&#xD;
      started on the index date. The first 6 months of the post-index period (initiation period)&#xD;
      were used to assess MS symptoms and adherence. Months 7 - 18 of the post-index period&#xD;
      (post-initiation period) were used to measure adherence and outcomes. The 24-month&#xD;
      observation period for each patient comprised the 6-month pre-index and 18-month post-index&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥18 years old during year of index date with valid gender and geographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continuous enrollment (CE) in the health plan with medical and pharmacy benefits for&#xD;
             ≥6 months (180ii days) before the index date (pre-index period)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CE with medical and pharmacy benefits for ≥18 months (540 days) beginning on the index&#xD;
             date (post-index period)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients had uniform 6-month pre-index and 18-month post-index periods&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥1 medical claim with an MS diagnosis codei in any position during the pre-or&#xD;
             post-index periods&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥1 claim for fingolimod after the index date (i.e., from index date +1 to 539 days&#xD;
             post-index)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  By requiring ≥1 medical claim with an MS diagnosis code and ≥2 claims with an NDC&#xD;
                  for fingolimod, the inclusion criteria essentially incorporated the&#xD;
                  preferred/overall best performing MS case-finding definition validated by&#xD;
                  Culpepper et al. The criteria for that definition required at least 3 separate&#xD;
                  encounters from any of the following: MS-related ambulatory visits, MS-related&#xD;
                  inpatient stays, and DMT claims during a 12-month period. Slightly higher&#xD;
                  accuracy was found when a 24-month period was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        •≥1 pharmacy or medical claim for any MS DMT during the pre-index period&#xD;
