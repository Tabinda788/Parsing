  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project explores the association between learning and cognitive flexibility by testing&#xD;
      whether a cognitive behavioral intervention designed to improve flexibility in ASD changes&#xD;
      learning and associated neural activation using model-based functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (m-fMRI). The study proposes that variability in learning mechanisms is associated&#xD;
      with behavioral flexibility and explains differences in adaptive and treatment outcomes. The&#xD;
      study employs a longitudinal case-controlled design in 54 14-18 year old youth with ASD at 3&#xD;
      time-points 8 months apart, each including m-fMRI during learning and behavioral measurement&#xD;
      of executive and adaptive function. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that individual variation in&#xD;
      learning biases and their neural correlates predicts behavioral flexibility and is stable&#xD;
      over time. Aim 2 tests plasticity of learning mechanisms induced by a cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      intervention for flexibility. Aim 3 tests hypothesis about intervention-induced plasticity of&#xD;
      neural functional connectivity.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Executive Function Challenge Task (EFCT) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>8-12 months before intervention, at start of intervention, 8-12 months after intervention begins</time_frame>
    <description>The EFCT is an objective and ecologically valid task developed by our research team to assess flexibility and planning skills in a social context conducted by a trained research staff member masked to treatment condition. The EFCT uses a standardized, semi-structured protocol which does not provide explicit rules for completing the tasks to mimic the implicit, unspoken, unstructured expectations in everyday life. The EFCT consists of challenges across several activities and responses are scored on a 3-point scale for each task. The scale (0-good, 1-intermediate, 2-poor performance) has task-specific behavioral markers to guide scoring.</description>

    <measure>Change in Neural Response During Prototype Learning Task Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>8-12 months before intervention, at start of intervention, 8-12 months after intervention begins</time_frame>
    <description>The Prototype Task measures learning of abstract representations in the visual domain. The task requires classification into two categories of visual exemplars characterized by a number of features (e.g., cartoon fish with features such as a particular eye shape, fins, body shape etc.) for training with feedback. Following training, generalization of learned information is tested on exemplars that are similar to training items but have never been presented before. Participants perform the generalization phase in an MRI scanner for measurement of brain activation. Learning of abstract visual representation (e.g., prototype learning) on this task is indicated by engagement of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)</description>

    <description>This executive function group therapy curriculum for adolescents uses cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, and focuses on key functions needed for adult success, such as: self-advocacy, flexibility, time management, motivation, goal setting, developing plans, monitoring progress. Guided practice begins with concrete interventionist support and moves to interventionist cueing, self-cueing, and finally automatic use of the skills without support.</description>
