    <measure>Assessment of the degree of patient dependence according &quot;Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living&quot; KATZ scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measurement of the subject's ability to perform activities of daily living independently. The Index ranks adequacy of performance in the six functions of bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding. A high score (6) indicates full function (patient independent). 2 or less score, indicates severe functional impairment.(patient very dependent)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of patient's level of dependence through an appreciation of instrumental activities of daily living according Lawton scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The measure is calculated by summing the point values for each question. The maximum score of 8 indicates that all activities can be performed independently. A minimum score of 0 indicates that the measured activites of daily living can only be performed partially or not at all.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of depression according MINI Geriatric depression scale (Mini-GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>If the score is greater than or equal to 1: high probability of depression. If the score is 0: high probability of no depression.</description>
