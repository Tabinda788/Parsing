  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Patients with severe traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) have limited improvement in&#xD;
      visual function despite therapy. The hypothesis of the study is that the targeted shortwave&#xD;
      diathermy combined with perceptual training may enhance visual function in patients with&#xD;
      severe TON after endoscopic optic nerve decompression (EOND) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Clinical trial Subjects: Twenty-two subjects with severe TON after EOND surgery were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either a rehabilitation (Reh) group or nonrehabilitation (Nreh) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: High-resolution computed tomography and MRI were used to locate the impaired nerve.&#xD;
      The subjects in the Reh group received targeted shortwave diathermy therapy 5 days per week&#xD;
      for 4 weeks and perceptual training 5 days per week for 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: A thorough evaluation of visual function, visual evoked potential, and&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging was executed.&#xD;

      Study sample description Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) was diagnosed by a history&#xD;
      of blunt head or facial trauma combined with decreased visual acuity, color vision and a&#xD;
      relative afferent pupillary defect with a normal fundus during the early period of&#xD;
      post-trauma. The investigators excluded cases with direct trauma to optic nerve identified by&#xD;
      high-resolution CT scan of the orbital and optic canal. The patients with indirect TON were&#xD;
      intravenously administered methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day) every day for three&#xD;
      consecutive days. All consecutive subjects with indirect TON who were admitted to Xiangya&#xD;
      Hospital and managed with endoscopic optic nerve decompression surgery were recruited. The&#xD;
      subjects were randomly assigned to either a rehabilitation group or a nonrehabilitation&#xD;
      group. Since there were no grading criteria in evaluating the severity of indirect TON, TON&#xD;
      with Best-corrected visual acuity equal to or more than 1.85 LogMAR after endoscopic optic&#xD;
      nerve decompression surgery was considered severe TON and those patients were recruited in&#xD;
      this study. The subjects in the rehabilitation group will receive shortwave diathermy therapy&#xD;
      and perceptual training after endoscopic optic nerve decompression surgery. The subjects in&#xD;
      the nonrehabilitation group will not receive any rehabilitation treatment after endoscopic&#xD;
      optic nerve decompression surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic ON decompression surgery All operations were performed under general anesthesia by&#xD;
      a surgeon (Hua Zhang). Briefly, a routine endoscopic endonasal sphenoethmoidectomy was&#xD;
      performed to expose and resect the posterior ethmoidal lamina papyracea. After the optic&#xD;
      canal was exposed, the upper, medial and partial lower surfaces of the whole range of the&#xD;
      optic canal wall were removed. Finally, the ON sheath from the annulus of the Zinn to the&#xD;
      cranial cavity, along with the annulus of the Zinn, was incised, and the surface of the ON&#xD;
      was covered with a piece of gelatin sponge filled with methylprednisolone solution (40&#xD;
      mg/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortwave diathermy therapy The Shortwave diathermy (SWD) device applied in this study was&#xD;
      DL-CⅡ (Dajia®, Shantou, China). This therapeutic apparatus delivered at a frequency of&#xD;
      approximately 27.12±0.6% MHz in continuous modes with a power of 50 W±20%. In our study, two&#xD;
      sets of circular capacitive electrodes were used with a diameter of 80 mm for adults and 50&#xD;
      mm for children. The fracture areas were located using high-resolution CT scan. One electrode&#xD;
      was applied in the temporal area of the ipsilateral side of the injured nerve identified by a&#xD;
      three-dimensional alignment procedure through high-resolution CT scan. This area was not only&#xD;
      shorter distance from the skin to the injured nerve but was also as far away from the&#xD;
      crystalline lens as possible. To decrease the negative effects of SWD on the nerve systems,&#xD;
      another circular electrode of SWD was applied in the frontal area of the ipsilateral side of&#xD;
      the injured nerve. In the acute stage of the TON (within 10 days after injury), the athermal&#xD;
      mode of the SWD was applied to the marked areas for a 10-minute daily session. Ten days after&#xD;
      injury, the microthermal mode was used for a 15-minute daily session. All subjects in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation group received SWD therapy 5 days per week for 4 wks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceptual training Perceptive learning sessions were composed of a series of training&#xD;
      procedures. First, sensory stimulations including touch, stroking, tapping and pressing on&#xD;
      the local area of the ipsilateral eye as well as surface location of the injured ON were&#xD;
      offered. Second, light stimulation was applied at different intensities of bright based on&#xD;
      evaluation of the pupillary light reflex of the subject, 1 to 5 seconds each time, 10 to 15&#xD;
      times a day, and avoiding glare and longtime light stimulation on eye when training.&#xD;
      Additionally, the subjects were instructed to enter the bright room from the dark room when&#xD;
      the participants were wearing an eye patch in the intact eye. Third, differentiation of the&#xD;
      shapes and objects in dynamic or static states with different colors, different sizes and&#xD;
      different shapes was performed. Either real objects or pictures could be selected in the&#xD;
      training session. Fourth, different written words with different sizes and different&#xD;
      distances were discriminated in the different directions of the eye. Based on evaluation of&#xD;
      the visual acuity, the training sequence was from large words to small, from simple words to&#xD;
      complex, and from proximal to distal distance of the eye. Fifth, color vision was trained&#xD;
      using real objects or pictures. The subjects were instructed to select the color from the&#xD;
      single and bright to multiple and dark color. The color contrast was initiated from maximum&#xD;
      to minimal contrast. Finally, the visual field training was scattered in the above training&#xD;
      methods. Each training media including the light, objects, words and color was input from the&#xD;
      anterior, superior, inferior, nasal and temporal sides of the eye. These trainings started&#xD;
      from the center of the normal visual field to the terminal of the visual field. When the&#xD;
      training media reached the terminal of the visual field in every direction, ocular fixation&#xD;
      with 2-5 seconds was performed to increase the scope of the visual field. Each stimulation&#xD;
      was given 5-10 times for each direction. In the early periods of the training, when the&#xD;
      visual acuity was complete loss, the training sections were relatively independent. When the&#xD;
      visual acuity of subjects was partially recovered, the training sections were mixed. In&#xD;
      addition, many training techniques were used in this study. First, visual imagery training&#xD;
      was used when the patients had complete or severe visual loss. Visual imagery training can be&#xD;
      defined as &quot;a dynamic state during which the representation of a specific object is&#xD;
      internally reactivated within visual memory without any overt visual input and that is&#xD;
      governed by the principles of central visual control&quot;. The intervention of the VI training&#xD;
      was as follows: the subjects used the intact eye to observe the object for 5 seconds, then&#xD;
      the participants closed their eyes and imagined viewing the object using the injured eye for&#xD;
      10 seconds for 10 repetitions. Additionally, proprioceptive training, including going over&#xD;
      the barriers, going up and downstairs, walking the slope, and training the balance, was&#xD;
      executed. Finally, constraint-induced perceptive therapy was performed when the visual lesion&#xD;
      partially recovered. The subjects wore an eye patch on the intact eye for 30 minutes in one&#xD;
      section, 2 to 4 hours a day, 7 days per week. In constraint-induced perceptive training,&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADL), natural environmental training and fun games with colorful&#xD;
      objects were executed, and the subjects were instructed to complete the ADL, play gobang,&#xD;
      watch the green leaves and colorful flowers from proximal to distal distance. All the&#xD;
      subjects in the Reh group received perceptive learning therapy 5 days per week for 10 weeks&#xD;
      except constraint-induced perceptive therapy.&#xD;
