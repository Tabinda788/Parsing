    <textblock>
      The LATA trial will find out if taking a long-acting injectable form of HIV medicines, called&#xD;
      cabotegravir and rilpivirine, every 2 month works as well as taking tablet HIV medicines&#xD;
      every day in young people aged 12-19 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is organised by an international group of researchers from Europe and Africa, and&#xD;
      will include 460 young people, from Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of HIV treatment is to make sure the HIV virus in the blood remains very low; this&#xD;
      is called having an undetectable viral load (virological suppression). If this goal is&#xD;
      achieved and sustained life-long, then people with HIV infection can live a healthy life,&#xD;
      with a normal life expectancy. However, it is challenging to take medication every single day&#xD;
      for life. This may be an even bigger challenge for teenagers living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is now a new way of taking HIV treatment. This is through an injection form of the HIV&#xD;
      medicines. Two injections, one of cabotegravir and one of rilpivirine, have to be given in&#xD;
      the clinic every 8 weeks. One injection will be given in the left cheek of the buttock and&#xD;
      the other in the right cheek of the buttock at the same visit. This is called an&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In LATA, two different ways of taking HIV medicines will be compared. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomised, with an equal chance that they will either go into the long-acting injectable&#xD;
      group or get a daily tablet by mouth. This is what happens depending on which group they are&#xD;
      randomised to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-Acting Injectable Group: In this group, there are 2 options. The first is to stay&#xD;
           on current HIV medicines by mouth and then to start the injections around 4 weeks after&#xD;
           randomisation. If this is the choice, then at week 4, the first 2 injections will be&#xD;
           given, the second two will be given 4 weeks later, and then it's every 8 weeks from then&#xD;
           on. The second option is to switch to taking one tablet of cabotegravir and one tablet&#xD;
           of rilpivirine for approximately 4-5 weeks before starting the injections. The reason&#xD;
           that some people might choose to have the tablet forms first, is to make sure they&#xD;
           tolerate them. This is called an oral lead-in (OLI). For the OLI group, and as long as&#xD;
           liver test results at 4 weeks are within normal levels, the first two injections will be&#xD;
           given at around 5 weeks (about a week after the week 4 visit), the second two are given&#xD;
           4 weeks later, and then it's every 8 weeks from then on.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous Oral Treatment Group: this group will continue to take HIV medicines every&#xD;
           day by mouth. However, to join the trial, some participants will have to change some of&#xD;
           their oral medications as the combination being used is dolutegravir with tenofovir plus&#xD;
           either lamivudine or emtricitabine as a single tablet taken once a day, called TLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LATA trial will enrol 460 young people living with HIV-1 from Kenya, South Africa, Uganda&#xD;
      and Zimbabwe. People taking part need to be 12 to 19 years old, HIV-1-positive, have&#xD;
      undetectable HIV-1 viral load (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL) for at least the last year, on&#xD;
      combination ART, and never have switched HIV medication in the past because of treatment&#xD;
      failure. In order to join, adolescents who are at least 18 years old will need to sign the&#xD;
      consent form for themselves. The consent form describes what the trial is about and what is&#xD;
      required of participants. Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years of age will have to sign an assent&#xD;
      form - this assent form describes what the trial is about and what is required of&#xD;
      participants. The assent form can be signed without a parent or guardian in the same room.&#xD;
      The assent form has the same information in it as the consent form that their parent or&#xD;
      guardian will also need to sign as well, to agree to them taking part in LATA. Each person&#xD;
      taking part will stay in the trial for at least 96 weeks (about 2 years) although it may be&#xD;
      longer, between 3-4 years. Young women enrolled in LATA must not be pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
      when they join and must avoid getting pregnant during their time in the trial. For young&#xD;
      women in the long-acting injectables group, they must also avoid getting pregnant for at&#xD;
      least 12 months after the last injection is given; this is because not much is known about&#xD;
      the safety of these injections in pregnancy. If, however, a young woman does get pregnant&#xD;
      while they are on the long-acting injectables, they should immediately contact their clinic&#xD;
      for advice and support. More details will be provided in a separate information sheet and&#xD;
      consent form about options for HIV treatment during pregnancy, including staying on the&#xD;
      long-acting injectables with additional monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the trial everyone will be screened to make sure they meet the criteria&#xD;
      to participate, then they will be randomised - by a computer- to one of the groups in the&#xD;
      study. For the long-acting injectable group, there are the 2 options as described above and&#xD;
      one or two additional visits around 4-5 weeks after being randomised into the trial. People&#xD;
      taking part in the trial will be asked to visit the clinic every 8 weeks until the last&#xD;
      participant who joined the trial has been in the trial for 96 weeks. The trial research team&#xD;
      will ask questions about health, wellbeing and mood at some of the visits. For girls who have&#xD;
      started their periods, a pregnancy test will be done at each visit. Everyone will have their&#xD;
      viral load measured approximately every 6 months and they and their doctors will receive the&#xD;
      results, which show how much HIV virus is in the blood. At some visits a blood sample will be&#xD;
      stored, which may be looked at later for HIV viral load or for changes to the virus that may&#xD;
      stop some treatment working as well. An additional blood sample will also be taken at the&#xD;
      beginning and then once a year, and urine samples at the beginning and at week 96; these&#xD;
      stored samples will be used to look at the health of people's kidneys, bone, heart and other&#xD;
      organ systems; they are optional. In addition, to the main trial, there are sub-studies&#xD;
      (smaller studies within the main trial), which people taking part may be invited to take part&#xD;
      in. Some participants in LATA will be invited to take part in a social science sub-study&#xD;
      where there are interviews to find out how people feel about HIV and their medication. In&#xD;
      another sub-study, the mood (neuropsychiatric) sub-study, there are additional surveys to&#xD;
      find out if young people are having problems with feeling down or worried about HIV, their&#xD;
      medication and other things going on in their lives. A small number of participants may be&#xD;
      asked to take part in a study that measures the amount of HIV medicine in the blood. These&#xD;
      sub-studies require additional consent, so people can decide if they do or don't want to take&#xD;
      part in these sub-studies, and it won't affect being in the LATA trial. At selected sites, a&#xD;
      further sub-study is about checking the amount of muscle and fat in the body, using a monitor&#xD;
      placed on the arm, which doesn't hurt at all. The information for this sub-study is in the&#xD;
      main LATA information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be able to show whether the injection forms of HIV medicine work as well as&#xD;
      taking the daily tablets of HIV medicines in adolescents living with HIV. If the long-acting&#xD;
      injectables given every 8 weeks work as well as the daily oral tablet, it is hoped the HIV&#xD;
      guidelines will change to recommend this as an option for how adolescents and young people&#xD;
      take their HIV medicines.&#xD;
