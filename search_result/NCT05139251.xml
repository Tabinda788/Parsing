    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to strengthen the skills and self-efficacy of women by&#xD;
      addressing the social and emotional trauma that they have experienced from inter-personal&#xD;
      violence (IPRV) and homelessness and to promote positive parenting strategies through Play&#xD;
      and Learning Strategies (ePALS), an evidence based intervention.&#xD;

      We propose an intervention that provides counseling and social support to women who have&#xD;
      experienced IPRV (Recovering from Intimate partner violence through Strengths and Empowerment&#xD;
      (RISE)) and to teach Play and Learning Strategies (ePALS) to improve the well-being of women&#xD;
      experiencing homelessness and their children.&#xD;

    <description>RISE intervention will be implemented for a period of 4 weeks at the beginning of the program. Four components/modules of the RISE intervention which includes a) education on health effects of violence, b) improving coping and self-care, c) enhancing social support, and d) addressing sexual violence will be used. Toward the beginning of each session the participant will complete a brief survey including a 10-item general self-efficacy scale to be graphed and discussed together to provide more immediate feedback to women about their progress, and at times, inform module selection. At the conclusion of each RISE session, women are asked to set a goal related to the topic in consultation with the clinician</description>

    <description>Participants and their children will then receive 6 weekly sessions of ePALS. The ePALS sessions include rapport building, recognizing and understanding children's signals, contingently responding to signals, labeling objects and actions, learning book reading strategies, maintaining children's focus of attention, helping children with self-regulation, and language scaffolding techniques. Each parent will have a personal parenting coach who remotely supports their progress through the program.&#xD;
After a parent views a PALS coaching session, they will videotape themselves trying the strategy for that week with their child. Then their coach sets up a zoom call and together they talk about the PALS strategy and view the video. The coach facilitates parental appraisal of their behavior and discuss what they thought worked with their child and what they want to do differently.</description>
