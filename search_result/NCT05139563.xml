  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aims of SAMURAI (South African Male User Research on Acceptability of Implants&#xD;
      and Injections) are to assess acceptability of, and preferences for, novel long-acting&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (LA-PrEP) delivery formulation use among key end-users: heterosexual&#xD;
      men and men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in South Africa, a country most impacted by human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence and prevalence. Early involvement of men in product&#xD;
      development is an important opportunity to measure and address product acceptability and&#xD;
      factors that may influence adherence and to foster male ownership of novel HIV prevention&#xD;
      delivery modalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-acting (LA) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) offers a promising alternative to existing&#xD;
      HIV prevention methods. Research to assess end-user acceptability and actual experiences of&#xD;
      novel delivery formulations has neglected, however, to include male perspectives, despite&#xD;
      these products being appropriate for use by both men and women. This research aims to assess&#xD;
      acceptability of and preferences for novel LA PrEP delivery formulation use among key end&#xD;
      users: heterosexual men and men who have sex with men (MSM) in South Africa. Early&#xD;
      involvement of men in product development is an important opportunity to measure and address&#xD;
      product acceptability and foster male ownership of novel strategies, thereby enhancing&#xD;
      potential effectiveness and impact, and broadening male engagement in HIV prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LA PrEP delivered by implant or injection addresses user preferences for simplicity,&#xD;
      discretion, and longer dose duration. Currently, there are several PrEP implants in&#xD;
      preclinical development and a few injectable formulations in early human phase trials.&#xD;
      Biomedical strategies have two core components: the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the&#xD;
      delivery mechanism; both of which contribute to acceptability and successful use of products.&#xD;
      Research to assess acceptability of placebo use of LA PrEP delivery forms among end users&#xD;
      provides insight that may apply to the many products under development. The contraceptive&#xD;
      field provides substantial information about potential acceptability and use of LA delivery&#xD;
      methods among women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, there is a gap in knowledge&#xD;
      regarding acceptability of implant and injectable dosing platforms among men, particularly in&#xD;
      SSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a four-year study to comparatively examine acceptability and&#xD;
      preferences of placebo implants and injectables using a crossover-designed mixed methods&#xD;
      study among heterosexual men and MSM in Johannesburg and Cape Town, South Africa. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that men will find implant use acceptable as a delivery form and no&#xD;
      less acceptable than intramuscular injections. First, formative qualitative research with men&#xD;
      (n=40) will be conducted to assess knowledge and experiences and inform messages and&#xD;
      materials for our Aim 2 and 3 work. Subsequently, a clinical crossover study will be&#xD;
      conducted, in which men (n=200) will wear placebo implants for 6 months and have three&#xD;
      bimonthly injections in a randomized sequence. Preferences for these delivery forms and&#xD;
      product attributes of these LA methods, oral PrEP, and condoms will then be measured using a&#xD;
      discrete choice experiment survey.&#xD;
