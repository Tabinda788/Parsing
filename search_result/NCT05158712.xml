  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) is a rare syndrome associated with activating&#xD;
      mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, combining medullary thyroid cancer in approximately 100%&#xD;
      of cases and pheochromocytoma in 10-80% of cases. While it is accepted that the RET mutation&#xD;
      causes variable penetrance of pheochromocytoma in the MEN2A patient population, there is no&#xD;
      pathophysiological explanation for the phenotypic variability among patients with the same&#xD;
      mutation, including within the same family. The aim of our study is to better characterise&#xD;
      the genetic factors that may explain the variable penetrance of pheochromocytoma in MEN2. To&#xD;
      this end, we plan to perform a whole exome analysis in 2 families carrying the p. Cys634Arg&#xD;
      mutation causing NEM2A, followed in Marseille by the principal investigator: the 1st family&#xD;
      has 11 members all aged over 35 years, for which 8 are carriers of pheochromocytoma while 3&#xD;
      have not developed it (while their age is higher than the latest age of diagnosis of&#xD;
      pheochromocytoma in this family); the 2nd family has 3 members (father and daughter with&#xD;
      pheochromocytoma developed before 25 years; son without pheochromocytoma at an age of 42&#xD;
      years). We believe that the analysis of these patients should allow the isolation of variants&#xD;
      on genes potentially involved in the genesis of a pheochromocytoma in MEN2.&#xD;
