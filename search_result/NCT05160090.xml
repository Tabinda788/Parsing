  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of 2 different formulations of&#xD;
      bupropion after a single oral dose administration under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the Test&#xD;
      and Reference formulations in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover, single&#xD;
      dose study design, in which 34 healthy adult subjects will receive 1 of the study treatments&#xD;
      during each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject eligibility for this study will be determined at the screening visit and eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit at least 10 hours prior to drug&#xD;
      administration for each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study period, subjects will receive a single 300 mg oral dose of bupropion, under&#xD;
      fasting conditions and undergo a 96-hour PK sample collection. Subjects are to be discharged&#xD;
      from the clinic after the 36-hour postdose PK sample collection, and following medical&#xD;
      approval. However, they may be advised to stay at the clinical site for safety reasons, if&#xD;
      judged necessary by the physician in charge. Subjects will return to the clinic for blood&#xD;
      collections at 48, 72, and 96 hours postdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug administrations in each period will be separated by at least 14 calendar days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the clinical portion of this study (excluding the screening period) is&#xD;
      expected to be approximately 19 days. The actual overall study duration may vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests during study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alcohol breath test will be performed before each period of the study. Screening for drugs&#xD;
      of abuse will be performed before each period of the study. A C-SSRS questionnaire will be&#xD;
      performed prior to each study period, as well as before discharge of each period. Neurologic&#xD;
      Function Test will be performed at screening, approximately 26 hours after each drug&#xD;
      administration &amp; end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For female subjects, a serum pregnancy test will be performed before each period of the study&#xD;
      &amp; end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs will be measured prior to and approximately 2.5, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 36 hours&#xD;
      following each drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      neurologic function tests, and AE monitoring. Additional safety measurements may be performed&#xD;
      at the discretion of the investigator for reasons related to subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician in charge will be present at the clinical site for at least the first 6 hours&#xD;
      following each drug administration and will remain available at all times throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology, general biochemistry (including a serum pregnancy test for female subjects), and&#xD;
      urinalysis tests will be repeated along with the collection of the last blood sample of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete physical examination (including vital signs) will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioanalysis: Bupropion &amp; its metabolites plasma concentrations will be measured by a&#xD;
      validated bioanalytical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standards for Bioequivalence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical inference of bupropion will be based on a bioequivalence approach using the&#xD;
      following standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence interval calculated from the&#xD;
      exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference products for the ln-transformed&#xD;
      parameters Cmax, AUC0-T, AUC0-∞, should all be within the 80.00 to 125.00% bioequivalence&#xD;
      range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the metabolites (hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion) , the&#xD;
      same criteria will be applied and the results will be presented as supportive evidence of&#xD;
      comparable therapeutic outcome.&#xD;
