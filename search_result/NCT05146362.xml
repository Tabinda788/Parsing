  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Retaining Employment and Talent after Injury/Illness Network (RETAIN) demonstration is a&#xD;
      collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the Social Security&#xD;
      Administration (SSA) to improve employment outcomes for individuals who experience injuries&#xD;
      or illnesses that put them at risk of exiting the labor force and relying on disability&#xD;
      programs and other public supports in the long term. RETAIN projects include a combination of&#xD;
      medical provider services, stay-at-work/return-to-work (SAW/RTW) coordination services, and&#xD;
      other SAW/RTW services. This evaluation will focus on the Vermont Department of Labor's&#xD;
      implementation of &quot;Vermont RETAIN&quot; statewide. The evaluation will document how the project is&#xD;
      implemented, describe enrollees, estimate the project's impacts on enrollees' outcomes, and&#xD;
      assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Vermont Department of Labor is partnering with health care, employment, and other&#xD;
      entities to implement &quot;Vermont RETAIN.&quot; SSA contracted with Mathematica to conduct an&#xD;
      independent evaluation of the program. Under the RETAIN model medical providers receive&#xD;
      training and incentives to use occupational health best practices. The state agency also&#xD;
      coordinates SAW/RTW services for the enrollee, fosters communication among Vermont RETAIN&#xD;
      stakeholders about the treatment enrollee returning to work, and monitors the enrollee's&#xD;
      medical and employment progress. Providers at participating practices are trained in the&#xD;
      Vermont Best Practice Resources and Training, which explains how to identify early and then&#xD;
      manage the risk of work disability to help prevent long-term unemployment. Participants&#xD;
      undergo a systematic assessment of barriers to work, work goals, and function in order to&#xD;
      create a personalized RTW plan; RTW coordinators use a strength-based coaching model and&#xD;
      provide care coordination through a customized mobile health app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vermont plans to work with 68 primary care practices across the state and enrolls clusters of&#xD;
      medical practices to participate in the study. The evaluation team randomly assigns each&#xD;
      cluster to either a treatment or control group. Mathematica conducts random assignment of&#xD;
      clusters on a rolling basis as Vermont enrolls clusters. Vermont invites eligible individuals&#xD;
      who see a medical provider in either the treatment or control group to enroll in the study.&#xD;
      Individuals who see a provider that has been randomly assigned to the treatment group and who&#xD;
      enroll in the study are considered &quot;treatment group enrollees&quot; and are eligible for Vermont&#xD;
      RETAIN services. Individuals who see a provider in the control group and enroll in the study&#xD;
      are considered &quot;control group enrollees&quot; and are not eligible for Vermont RETAIN services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation team then compares the outcomes of the treatment and control groups and&#xD;
      gathers evidence on how RETAIN shaped the outcomes of enrollees who were eligible for its&#xD;
      services, regardless of whether they participated in those services. Data sources include&#xD;
      enrollment data, surveys, administrative records, program data, and qualitative data.&#xD;
