    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of donafenib combined with S-1 in treating Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer after&#xD;
      chemotherapy with Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While NG ( Nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) is one of the preferred first-line chemotherapy for&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer, we have to investigate possible therapeutic options after NG&#xD;
      regimen. In this single arm, open-label clinical trial, metastatic pancreatic cancer patients&#xD;
      will be received donafenib and S-1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until the disease&#xD;
      recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, death or begin a novel therapeutic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety data will be assessed through OS, ORR, DCR, PFS,TTP and adverse&#xD;
      effects as graded by NCI CTC-AE 5.0.&#xD;
