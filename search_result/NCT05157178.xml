  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare antibody response and safety of the Covid-19&#xD;
      (recombinante) vaccine according to different time intervals between the first two doses (4,&#xD;
      8 and 12 weeks) and serologic status immediately before the vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all participants giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be evaluated for eligibility criteria. At day 0, participants who meet&#xD;
      the eligibility requirements will undergo a thorough medical evaluation and a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test (if applicable). Eligible participants will be placed in one of three vaccination&#xD;
      interval groups (4, 8 or 12 weeks between the first two Covid -19 (recombinante) vaccine&#xD;
      doses) in a randomized manner, via a computer program created by the statistical annalist.&#xD;
      Both participant and research team will know the allocated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible and consenting participants will have a blood sample collected (IgG Anti-S&#xD;
      antibodies) and immediately after be administered a third dose of the Covid-19 (recombinante)&#xD;
      vaccine. Participants will be instructed to fill out an adverse events journal for solicited&#xD;
      adverse events for 7 days and non-solicited adverse events for 28 days after each dose. The&#xD;
      research team will contact the participant remotely at least twice during the first two&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will return for a follow-up visit to the research center 28 days after each&#xD;
      dose, to evaluate adverse events, collect blood samples (IgG Anti-S antibodies) and undergo a&#xD;
      thorough medical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will also return to the research center to collect blood samples (IgG Anti-S&#xD;
      antibodies) in two more follow-up visits: 6 and 12 months after vaccination with Covid-19&#xD;
      (recombinante).&#xD;
