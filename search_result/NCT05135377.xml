    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis is the most severe form of allergy that rapidly affects multiple body&#xD;
      systems and can be deadly. The highest incidence of anaphylaxis is in children and&#xD;
      adolescents. In Canada, approximately every 10 minutes there is an Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      visit for food allergy, and up to 80% of anaphylactic reactions in children are triggered by&#xD;
      food. The ambiguity in how physicians manage anaphylaxis adds a huge burden to health care&#xD;
      and further contributes to ED crowding. Current Canadian and international treatment&#xD;
      guidelines universally recommend that all patients present to the ED for a prolonged period&#xD;
      (6-24 hours) of in-hospital monitoring after initial reactions have been treated, to increase&#xD;
      detection of biphasic anaphylaxis (BA). BA is a second wave of symptoms after initial&#xD;
      resolution. These guidelines are based on poor or little evidence and have unintended&#xD;
      negative impacts on patient safety and quality of life. Furthermore, this 'one-size fits all'&#xD;
      approach to care leads to wasteful resource utilization that provides low value care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the study is to derive a clinical prediction rule that&#xD;
      identifies children with anaphylaxis who are at risk of BA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This prospective multicenter cohort study will enroll 1682 patients from 7 pediatric&#xD;
      EDs that are members of the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) network. We will&#xD;
      enroll patients &lt; 18 years of age presenting to the ED with an allergic reaction that matches&#xD;
      the diagnostic criteria of anaphylaxis. Research assistants (RA) present in the ED will&#xD;
      screen, obtain consent, and prospectively collect all study data. The Research Assistant or&#xD;
      Research Nurse will follow patients during their ED visit and ascertain, in conjunction with&#xD;
      the medical team, if the patient developed biphasic anaphylaxis in the ED. A standardized&#xD;
      follow-up survey conducted within 2-5 days of ED or hospital discharge will determine if a&#xD;
      biphasic reaction occurred following ED disposition. We established an advisory council&#xD;
      comprised of end-users and community partners external to the project team to monitor project&#xD;
      milestones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TEAM: We have established an international multidisciplinary team of experts in&#xD;
      pediatrics, emergency medicine, allergy/immunology, research methodology and statistics, and&#xD;
      knowledge translation. Our team is supported by the PERC network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOME: Providing the best evidence-based, value care at the lowest cost is a moral&#xD;
      and ethical imperative. Therefore, in alignment with national and international research&#xD;
      priorities, we propose to develop a robust prediction model for BA. This model will address a&#xD;
      significant gap in current knowledge and practice, with anticipated benefit for patient care&#xD;
      and health system efficiency worldwide. This trial will generate novel, clinically relevant&#xD;
      data on optimal ED management of children with anaphylaxis that integrates best value care&#xD;
      with patient safety.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome for this prospective cohort study of children who present to ED with anaphylaxis is the development of biphasic anaphylaxis (BA) in the ED or after hospital/ED discharge. As per the published consensus definition in 2019, to be classified as BA, an anaphylactic reaction must meet 3 criteria: 1) initial anaphylactic reaction followed by resolution of all initial manifestations for â‰¥1 h, with no new symptoms or treatment administered in that time; 2) the second phase of new or recurrent symptoms or signs that meet the consensus definition of anaphylaxis, and 3) the new or recurrent symptoms or signs are not caused by antigen re-exposure. This definition focuses on clinically important or major biphasic reactions. Mild symptoms that involve only the skin (e.g. urticarial rash) without any other systems involvement will be captured and classified as minor biphasic responses. However, these minor responses do not meet our case definition for BA.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &lt; 18 years of age presenting to the ED with an allergic reaction that matches&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis as defined by the World Allergy Organization (WAO)&#xD;
             in 2019. The 2019 WAO anaphylaxis guidelines clarify the involvement of two organ&#xD;
             systems to diagnose anaphylaxis, stating that &quot;although the diagnosis of anaphylaxis&#xD;
             usually depends on the involvement of multiple organ systems, anaphylaxis may present&#xD;
             as an acute cardiac or respiratory event as the only manifestation of anaphylaxis.&quot;&#xD;
             Thus, a patient with isolated hypotension, bronchospasm, or upper airway obstruction&#xD;
             after exposure to a known or potential trigger will be deemed to have anaphylaxis,&#xD;
             even if typical skin features are absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Language proficiency in English or French&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anaphylactic reaction that occurred in the context of a suicidal attempt or&#xD;
             intoxication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anaphylactic reaction that begins in hospital and managed outside ED (on an inpatient&#xD;
             or outpatient unit)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who is unable to complete the follow-up survey post ED discharge.&#xD;
