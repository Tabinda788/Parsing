  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been implemented to evaluate cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker&#xD;
      (CRT-P) implantations on a same-day basis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to show in the French centers selected for the same-day&#xD;
      organization that a same-day CRT-P implantation is safe, feasible, and associated with&#xD;
      significant cost-saving and a minimum conversion rate to full hospitalization by comparing&#xD;
      outcomes with patients routinely hospitalized for at least one night. The medical economic&#xD;
      evaluation will be based on the SNDS (National Health Data System) analysis.&#xD;

    <description>The patient current health state will be estimated from the answers given by EuroQoL 5D (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. The EQ-5D-5L is a self-administered two-part instrument. The first part consists of 5 questions to assess current health state in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The second part is a 20 centimeters visual analog scale that ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
