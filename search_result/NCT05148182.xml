      According to the Chinese cardiovascular disease report released in 2017, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease death is the leading cause of death of urban and rural residents, so cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk assessment is particularly important. The development of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      assessment model was dated from Framingham Heart Study which first proposed the concept of&#xD;
      risk factors, and then adjusted the model several times. In 2016, the China-PAR evaluated the&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk of Chinese population. However, the application of metabolomics&#xD;
      in coronary heart disease is a rapidly developing field and also a new field .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Describe the risk factors of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the characteristics&#xD;
      of metabolomics in Chinese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Establish an accurate prediction model of atherosclerotic heart disease. Research plan：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1869 risk-stratified people were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plasma samples were collected incluing disease status and other potential influencing&#xD;
           factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Through the high-throughput detection of body metabolites, combined with multivariate&#xD;
           statistical analysis, the metabolic markers with significant difference in different&#xD;
           risk levels were screened for risk prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All recruited people underwent coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The distribution of age and gender in each group should be matched and balanced as far&#xD;
           as possible.&#xD;

    <description>Metabonomics analysis uses a non targeted detection method to detect polar compounds and lipid compounds in blood. The characteristic peaks of substances that can be detected are detected by chromatography Series platform, and then these characteristic peaks are compared with the standard library containing more than 8000 metabolites to annotate the compounds and screen out the differential metabolites between groups.</description>

      The instrument platforms of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are used to metabonomic analysis. Small molecular&#xD;
      metabolites in blood were measured by LC-MS and GC-MS.The instrument platforms of GC-MS and&#xD;
      LC-MS are used. The samples tested on GC-MS platform need to be derivatized, mainly for the&#xD;
      detection of polar and weak polar metabolites with molecular weight not higher than 1000Da&#xD;
      and low boiling point; LC-MS uses different liquid phase systems to detect polar and weak&#xD;
      polar metabolites, lipids and lipid soluble metabolites respectively; The same sample needs&#xD;
      to be detected through five data acquisition modes on three mass spectrometry platforms.&#xD;
