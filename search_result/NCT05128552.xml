    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to investigate the effect of the LVR technique on cough&#xD;
      ineffectiveness, to determine its benefit as a simple, safe, and inexpensive cough&#xD;
      augmentation technique, and to determine how much the LVR method, for augmenting CPF, is&#xD;
      useful in enhancing the success of extubation and reducing the rate of reintubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An effective cough is so vital in protecting against respiratory tract infections, so the&#xD;
      importance of an intact cough mechanism is reflected in the occurrence of pulmonary problems&#xD;
      which are the most common cause of hospital admission in people with respiratory muscle&#xD;
      weakness who are unable to cough effectively. Ineffective cough results in a tendency to&#xD;
      retain bronchial secretions and an increased risk of pulmonary complications, such as&#xD;
      frequent or recurrent pneumonia, atelectasis, and infectious respiratory problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cough flow testing (expiratory flows testing) is useful as a monitoring or diagnostic tool in&#xD;
      clinical practice and research. Both peak expiratory flows (PEF) and cough peak flows (CPF)&#xD;
      have been described as useful clinical measures of respiratory muscle function and cough&#xD;
      effectiveness. Cough peak flow (CPF) gives an important measure of the cough strength which&#xD;
      determines the effectiveness of cough. It is the maximum expiratory flow recorded immediately&#xD;
      following the opening of the glottis during normal cough. Cough effectiveness is suboptimal&#xD;
      when cough peak flow (CPF) is less than 270 L/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical Ventilation &quot;MV&quot; has deleterious effects caused by the endotracheal intubation,&#xD;
      including changes in mucociliary clearance and inhibition of the coughing mechanism which, in&#xD;
      turn, favor areas of hypoventilation and atelectasis, thus increasing the risk of&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia. Respiratory compromise due to recurrent atelectasis,&#xD;
      inability to clear secretions, and respiratory infections also increase morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Prolonged MV results in respiratory muscle dysfunction shown in diaphragmatic&#xD;
      atrophy and contractile dysfunction (ic., Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction&#xD;
      &quot;VIDD&quot;) affecting the ability of the person to cough effectively. Indeed, the onset of VIDD&#xD;
      in both animals and humans is rapid as significant diaphragmatic atrophy and contractile&#xD;
      dysfunction occur within the first 24 - 48 h of MV. Although suctioning of secretions from&#xD;
      the trachea to remove tracheobronchial and upper airway secretions is the standard of care,&#xD;
      this method is ineffective for clearing peripheral airways and basal retained secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical practice guides referred to patients with respiratory muscles weakness like&#xD;
      after prolonged MV and in neuromuscular diseases recommend the usage of cough augmentation&#xD;
      and mucociliary clearance techniques in patients with CPF &lt; 4.5 L/s (270 L'min) and using&#xD;
      such techniques continuously in patients with CPF &lt; 2.7 L/s (160 L/min). Cough augmentation&#xD;
      techniques such as LVR are supposed to be used to reinforce cough effectiveness, particularly&#xD;
      for patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation. So, the importance and strength of this&#xD;
      study are to assess the effects of the LVR technique as a cough augmentation mean on CPF of&#xD;
      post-extubated patients with an ineffective cough which can cause risky respiratory&#xD;
      complications may lead to death in confronting to effects of traditional chest physiotherapy&#xD;
      and suctioning and therefore, their therapy or management program can be precisely and&#xD;
      appropriately planned. Moreover, the identification of effective, safe measures to optimize&#xD;
      cough efficacy is, therefore, key to improving quality of life and minimizing morbidity &amp;&#xD;
      mortality rates in those patients. Additionally, as a secondary purpose to determine how much&#xD;
      the LVR method, for augmenting CPF. is useful in enhancing the success of extubation and&#xD;
      reducing the rate of re-intubation that indicated if extubation failure occurred.&#xD;
