  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of different massage techniques on pain,&#xD;
      primary dysmenorrhea (PD)-related symptoms and functional and emotional influence in women&#xD;
      with PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menstrual cramps without an underlying pelvic&#xD;
      pathology or organic problem. Massage, which is one of the physiotherapy methods that reduces&#xD;
      pain by acting on the autonomic nervous system and circulation, has an important place in the&#xD;
      management of PD among non-pharmacological treatment approaches. In the literature, there are&#xD;
      studies on the use of classical massage and connective tissue massage in women with PD for&#xD;
      reducing menstrual pain and PD-related symptoms. However, to the best of our knowledge, no&#xD;
      study has been found comparing classical massage and connective tissue massage in PD&#xD;
      management.&#xD;

    <description>Classical massage will be applied to the lumbal and abdominal region 5 days a week, from the estimated date of ovulation until the next menstrual bleeding begins. The application will take approximately 15 minutes. During the massage, the physiotherapist will apply stroking and kneading movements by using baby oil. During the treatment of the lumbal region, the patient will be in the prone position; during the treatment of the abdominal region, the patient will be in the supine position.</description>

    <description>Connective tissue massage will be applied to the lumbosacral, lower thoracic, abdominal and anterior pelvic regions 5 days a week, from the estimated date of ovulation until the onset of the next menstrual bleeding. The application will take approximately 15 minutes. During the massage, the physiotherapist will bring the tip of the middle finger of the hand into contact with the patient's skin and apply traction to the skin. During the treatment of the lumbar region, the patient will be in the sitting position, during the treatment of the abdominal and anterior pelvic region, the patient will be in the supine position.</description>
