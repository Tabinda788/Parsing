  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the destruction of insulin-producing cells by effector T&#xD;
      cells (Teffs), due to a deficiency of regulatory T cells (Tregs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ciclosporin effectively blocks the Teffs and controls diabetes, but cannot be considered as a&#xD;
      long-term treatment. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) activates and expands Tregs in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, Ld IL-2 in patients in whom the autoimmune process was blocked early by a short&#xD;
      treatment (2 months) of cyclosporine should restore immune homeostasis and maintain some&#xD;
      insulin production over the long term.&#xD;

      Primary Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tregs' response profile, after 4 administrations of 1MIU/day of IL-2 (Day 63-66) in patients&#xD;
      with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes who have been treated with ciclosporin for 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary assessment criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in Tregs values at D67 compared to D63 (post-ciclosporin values)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and secondary assessment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in residual insulin secretion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AUC plasma C-peptide concentration after a mixed meal tolerance test at Month 6&#xD;
                (Day 179), Month 12 (Day 361) and after treatment discontinuation at Month 18 (Day&#xD;
                536) and Month 24 (Day 719) compared to baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Insulin requirement, HbA1c dosage and IDAA1c score at Month 3 (Day 88), Month 6&#xD;
                (Day 179), Month 9 (Day 270), Month 12 (Day 361) and after treatment&#xD;
                discontinuation at Month 18 (Day 536) and Month 24 (Day 719) compared to baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in Tregs values at Month 3 (Day 88), Month 6 (Day 179), Month 9 (Day 270), Month&#xD;
           12 (Day 361) and after treatment discontinuation at Month 18 (Day 536) and Month 24 (Day&#xD;
           719) compared to baseline and post-ciclosporin values (Day 63)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ciclosporin and ILT-101/placebo compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind trial in parallel-groups,&#xD;
      evaluating a treatment by cyclosporine 7mg/kg/day during 2 months followed by&#xD;
      ILT-101/placebo, 1 MIU daily for 5 days and 1 MIU every week, during 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female, aged between 16 and 35 years, with recent diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (&lt; 3&#xD;
      months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 24 Inclusion period: 12 months Duration of patient participation: 24&#xD;
      months (treatment period: 12 months, follow-up period: 12months) Total duration of the study:&#xD;
      37 months&#xD;
