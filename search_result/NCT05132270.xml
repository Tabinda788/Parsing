      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of Hydroxyurea and&#xD;
      thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the change in liver and spleen size of beta-thalassemia patients on the&#xD;
      combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-arm non-randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy&#xD;
      of hydroxyurea and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. It was a twelve months study.&#xD;
      Participants were monitored for six months on Hydroxyurea alone and then the combination&#xD;
      therapy of hydroxyurea and thalidomide for another six months. Findings of physical&#xD;
      examination, vital signs, laboratory, and ultrasound findings were recorded at baseline,&#xD;
      during and end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Population This study included 135 Beta-thalassemia patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy&#xD;
      of hydroxyurea and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. The participants were evaluated&#xD;
      on the basis of eligibility criteria, consent was obtained and baseline investigations were&#xD;
      performed on the screening visit. Participants were continued on Hydroxyurea (10-20mg/kg/day)&#xD;
      for the first six months and then for the next six months thalidomide (2-5 mg/kg/day) was&#xD;
      added to the intervention. Aspirin was also added (2-4mg/kg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance or rise in Hemoglobin (Hb) levels and changes in transfusion frequency before and&#xD;
      after the use of combination therapy was used to evaluate the efficacy of the combination&#xD;
      therapy. Good responders were the patients who were on transfusion and went off-transfusion&#xD;
      after the combination therapy or individuals who were already off transfusion and after&#xD;
      combination therapy demonstrated an increase in Hb of at least 1gm/dl. Responders were those&#xD;
      who remained on transfusion on combination therapy but displayed a 50% reduction in blood&#xD;
      requirements. Whereas, non-responders, were individuals who were off-transfusion before&#xD;
      combination therapy and had improvement in Hb of &lt;1gm/dl, or those who remained on&#xD;
      transfusion during combination therapy and did not experience transfusion reduction of at&#xD;
      least 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the drug was evaluated on the basis of the following parameters and intervention&#xD;
      was discontinued or put on hold if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine &gt;1.1mg/dl, Urea &gt;43mg/dl),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver function (SGPT &gt;35mg/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute Neutrophil counts&lt;2*109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelets &lt; 100*109/L&#xD;
