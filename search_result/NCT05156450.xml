    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II clinical study of TQB3616 capsules in combination with abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate plus prednisone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, to&#xD;
      determine the dose for further clinical studies and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      this combined therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TQB3616 is an inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), which reduces&#xD;
      intracellular protein phosphorylation levels, prevents cells from entering synthesis (S)&#xD;
      phase from first gap (G1) phase, and inhibits cell proliferation to combat tumors. TQB3616&#xD;
      has superior inhibitory activity to Palbociclib and Abemaciclib against CDK4/6 kinase and may&#xD;
      benefit metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients through a&#xD;
      complementary mechanism of action when combined with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators intend to perform this phase Ib/II clinical study of TQB3616&#xD;
      capsules in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in patients with mCRPC.&#xD;

                  of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Allergy or previous history of severe allergy; or known hypersensitivity to study&#xD;
                  drug excipient components.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Previous history of definite neurological or psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Combination of a serious or poorly controlled disease that the investigator&#xD;
                  determines may be at greater risk for entry into this study [e.g., type 1 or type&#xD;
                  2 diabetes mellitus not controlled by medication, thyroid disease].&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. History of pituitary or adrenal gland dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Major surgical treatment, incisional biopsy or significant traumatic injury&#xD;
                  within 28 days prior to the start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Long-term untreated wounds or fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. History of substance abuse or drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participation in another drug clinical trial within the previous 30 days or current&#xD;
             enrollment in a clinical study involving an experimental product, or enrollment in any&#xD;
             other type of medical study judged to be scientifically or medically incompatible with&#xD;
             this study. Have participated in any clinical trial in which treatment assignment&#xD;
             remains blinded, and if the patient is currently enrolled in a clinical trial&#xD;
             involving an unapproved use of a medical device, concurrence of the investigator and&#xD;
             the Center is required to determine Eligibility for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Recent live vaccination (within 4 weeks prior to the first dose). Receipt of&#xD;
             inactivated vaccine is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Insufficient estimated patient compliance to participate in this clinical study.&#xD;
