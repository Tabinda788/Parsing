    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if there are significant differences in the failure rate&#xD;
      of stainless steel and ceramic brackets. For this study, patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      divided into two groups, according to the type of brackets (stainless steel or ceramic) used&#xD;
      for orthodontic treatment. Failure rates will be recorded every month for 12 months and&#xD;
      survival analysis will be performed, together with skeletal and space analysis.&#xD;

      This clinical trial aims to investigate if there are differences in the failure rates of&#xD;
      stainless steel and ceramic orthodontic brackets. Patients willing to start orthodontic fixed&#xD;
      therapy and recruited for the study will be asked to sign the informed consent. Parents will&#xD;
      sign the consent for underage patients. After that, patients will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group MET: stainless steel brackets will be bonded on the vestibular surfaces of teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group CER: ceramic brackets will be bonded on the vestibular surfaces of teeth. The&#xD;
           following sequence of archwires will be adopted for the first six months: 0.014-in Niti,&#xD;
           .016-in NiTi, 0.017X0.025-in NiTi, 0.019X0.025-in SS. The failure rates of the brackets&#xD;
           will be recorded each month for 12 months. Each failed bracket will be recorded once.&#xD;
           For each patient, pre-treatment lateral cephalometric radiograph and study models will&#xD;
           be used to measure ANB angle, Wits, Skeletal Class, dento-alveolar discrepancy and&#xD;
           Little Index at the beginning of the treatment. Bond failures will be recorded together&#xD;
           with the archwire engaged at the moment of the failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size was calculated with the following assumptions: ability to detect a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference of 5.12% in the failure rates (primary outcome) of the two&#xD;
      groups with an alfa = 0.05 and power = 85%. The assumptions were based on findings of a&#xD;
      previous study with an expected value of 12.08% for the first group at the end of 12 months&#xD;
      of therapy. Therefore, 1000 brackets (50 patients) per group were required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be conducted with R software (R version 3.1.3,&#xD;
      R Development Core Team, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Wien, Austria). Fisher exact&#xD;
      test will be performed to evaluate the differences between the failure rates of the two&#xD;
      groups, between anterior and posterior sites and between upper and lower arches. Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      survival analysis of the bond failures will be performed among the 12 months of the study.&#xD;
      Linear regressions will be calculated to assess the effects on bond failure of the skeletal&#xD;
      and dental variables collected before the bonding procedure. Significance for all statistical&#xD;
      tests will be predetermined at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Orthophosphoric acid 37% acid (Gerhò Etchant gel 37%, Gerhò spa, Terlano, Italy) will be applied for 30 s for the etching of the vestibular surfaces of teeth. The, after rinsing and drying, a thin layer of Transbond XT Light Cure Adhesive Primer (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA) will be applied and then cured for 10 s with a LED unit. At last, Transbond XT Light Cure Adhesive Paste (3M Unitek) will be applied on the base of stainless steel brackets (Queen Series Low Profile Brackets MBT 0.022&quot;, Aestetika, Terni, TR, Italy); brackets will be applied on the vestibular surfaces of teeth with a light pressure and the extra paste will be removed. Curing will be performed with the LED unit at 2 mm distant from the enamel-bracket interface for 40 s, 10 s per each surface (mesial, distal, gingival and occlusal). Then, the following sequence of archwires will be adopted for the first six months: .014-in Niti, .016-in NiTi, .017X.025-in NiTi, .019X.025-in SS (Aestetika, Terni, Italy).</description>
