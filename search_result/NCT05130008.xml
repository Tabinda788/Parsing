    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of implementing a 30-day digitally-enabled community health worker intervention&#xD;
      compared to usual care with a community health worker in reducing heart failure 30-day&#xD;
      readmissions within a pilot randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a highly prevalent disease in the United States, with elevated&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Nearly 6.2 million people in the US are affected by HF and this&#xD;
      number is expected to rise to 8.5 million by 2030. Total direct medical costs of HF, mostly&#xD;
      generated by inpatient hospitalizations, are estimated to increase from $21 billion in 2012&#xD;
      to $53 billion by 2030. HF is the leading cause of 30-day readmissions in the US; a quarter&#xD;
      of these are considered to be preventable. Most patients with HF are readmitted to hospital&#xD;
      medicine services for non-HF co-morbidities (e.g. pneumonia) with clinical, social, and&#xD;
      behavioral factors driving readmissions. Despite numerous interventions designed to prevent&#xD;
      readmissions, including telemetry monitoring, only marginal HF outcome improvement has been&#xD;
      observed. HF readmission rates remain elevated and could be prevented by a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while&#xD;
      addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach that has demonstrated improved chronic disease outcomes by addressing social,&#xD;
      behavioral, and basic clinical barriers to care- and has yet to be formally studied in HF&#xD;
      populations- is community health workers (CHWs). CHWs are members of clinical teams who&#xD;
      address social, economic, educational, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing&#xD;
      health outcomes while fostering patient connections to care teams. CHW care delivery is one&#xD;
      of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. CHWs&#xD;
      have basic clinical knowledge of specific conditions, along with a skillset designed to&#xD;
      address social and behavioral drivers of health outcomes like 30-day readmissions. However,&#xD;
      CHW care is challenged by key factors, including intensive 1:1 care delivery, limiting its&#xD;
      scale and efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, a biotechnology company launched a HF digital platform within a mobile phone&#xD;
      application to help reduce 30-day readmissions in patients with HF by 1) leveraging&#xD;
      artificial intelligence to minimize false alarms in biometric monitoring, 2) promoting early&#xD;
      identification of decline in HF patients, and 3) encouraging digital and in-person&#xD;
      communication between patients and care teams. In preliminary findings, digital platform&#xD;
      clinical trial data has shown promise in reducing HF 30-day readmissions. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of this platform in combination with CHW care in reducing&#xD;
      readmissions for medically and socially complex patients with HF. Through a partnership with&#xD;
      the digital platform creators, our team has helped develop a prototype for patients with HF&#xD;
      cared for by CHWs (&quot;digitally-enabled&quot; CHW care). Specifically, the aim of this proposal are&#xD;
      to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a&#xD;
      digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions&#xD;
      within a pilot RCT (n=50) My central hypothesis is that pairing patients with a&#xD;
      digitally-enabled CHW intervention that addresses social and behavioral barriers to HF care,&#xD;
      promotes communication with clinical care teams, and improves CHW efficiency will reduce&#xD;
      30-day readmissions while improving patient engagement with HF care.&#xD;
