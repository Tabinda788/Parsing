      The first in human clinical study is planned as an open-label, dose-escalation, and&#xD;
      dose-expansion, multicentre, two-part, Phase 1/2a study of PBP1510 administered to patients&#xD;
      with advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study will be conducted in two parts, Part 1&#xD;
      as a PBP1510 single agent dose-escalation, and PBP1510 dose-escalation in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine, and Part 2 as PBP1510 dose-expansion at the RP2D in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine.&#xD;

      The first in human clinical study is planned as an open-label, multicentre, two-part, Phase&#xD;
      1/2a study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of PBP1510 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer. Part 1 (Phase 1) is a dose-escalation phase, wherein 2&#xD;
      cycles of PBP1510 will be administered, as monotherapy (monotherapy cohorts) or in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine (combination cohorts) in advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      patients whose tumours have progressed on at least one previous line of chemotherapy for&#xD;
      locally advanced/metastatic disease. The RP2D will be selected based on the analysis of the&#xD;
      PK, safety, and efficacy data. Part 2 (Phase 2a) will be an open-label study and patients&#xD;
      will be administered the RP2D of PBP1510 derived from Part 1, for 4 cycles in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine for advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer patients whose tumour has&#xD;
      progressed on one previous line of chemotherapy for locally advanced/metastatic disease.&#xD;

             postmenopausal state is defined as cessation of regular menses for at least 12&#xD;
             consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause and have a&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level confirming the postmenopausal state in women&#xD;
