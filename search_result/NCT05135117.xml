  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During exercise in the heat, the thermoregulatory system impacts performance in an athletic&#xD;
      population. Increased in core body temperature could lead to development of heat-related&#xD;
      illnesses and impair physical performance. To facilitate heat loss and optimize performance&#xD;
      during exercise in the heat, various cooling strategies, including cold water immersion and&#xD;
      wearable cooling devices have been previously explored. Although whole body cooling by cold&#xD;
      water immersion is considered to be the most effective way to reduce core body temperature,&#xD;
      this cooling method would not be feasible for athletes during practice or competition.&#xD;
      Therefore, previous studies strongly recommended neck cooling during exercise because of the&#xD;
      rate of heat dissipation through the large blood vessel and accessibility compared to other&#xD;
      body part. Furthermore, multiple studies reported that the neck cooling could improve aerobic&#xD;
      performance (i.e. running distance and time). In addition to physiological changes, human&#xD;
      prefer to be cool in the neck region as well as the face in hot environment. Thus, local&#xD;
      cooling of the neck is efficient way to reduce thermal discomfort during heat exposure. The&#xD;
      novel neck cooling collar device (NeuroRescue Inc., Lafayette, LA) used in the current study&#xD;
      may be able to produce powerful effect of conductive cooling, which result in improving&#xD;
      performance and also reduce thermal discomfort during exercise in the heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While this neck cooling collar would assist athletes in improving sports safety and&#xD;
      performance by decreasing skin temperature around the neck, the effectiveness of this neck&#xD;
      cooling collar on core temperature was not examined at this point. Moreover, other&#xD;
      physiological and perceptual changes are important to assess along with changes in core body&#xD;
      temperature. Therefore, this study aims to examine how internal body temperature, heart rate,&#xD;
      perceptual measures, and athletic performance are affected by the novel neck cooling collar&#xD;
      during exercise in the heat.&#xD;
