  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational, analytical, multicentre prospective cohort study will be conducted&#xD;
      throughout Colombia. A sample size of 1353 patients is needed to achieve significance in our&#xD;
      primary objective; however, convenience sampling is considered, as we aim to include all the&#xD;
      institutions and patients possible. The data collection will be carried out prospectively for&#xD;
      one week, and all patients will have a follow-up of a maximum of 30 days in-hospital. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be to determine the in-hospital mortality. We aim to contribute with&#xD;
      accurate information on in-hospital postoperative mortality in Colombia. Thus, by following&#xD;
      precisely the instructions created by The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery. The data&#xD;
      obtained will help formulate public policies in the surgical field adjusted to the Colombian&#xD;
      population, improving the quality of the surgical divisions in the different Colombian&#xD;
      institutions, positively affecting the attention and development of the Colombian healthcare&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of this research is to describe the in-hospital postoperative mortality&#xD;
      of patients who have had surgical procedures in Colombian institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also aim to characterize the sociodemographic and clinical variables of the patients that&#xD;
      underwent a surgical procedure in Colombia, determine the secondary postoperative clinical&#xD;
      outcomes associated with surgical procedures in Colombia and illustrate the installed&#xD;
      surgical capacity and infrastructure of the participating health centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out throughout Colombia. The largest number possible of&#xD;
      institutions in which surgeries are performed will be included. We expect to have at least 2&#xD;
      or 3 institutions per region. We currently have 65 confirmed participating institutions and&#xD;
      have conducted a preliminary interaction with 257 institutions throughout the territory. The&#xD;
      list of participating centres and researchers will be continuously updated, and the final&#xD;
      version of the list will be attached to the final report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size estimate of 1353 patients was made to establish the lower limit needed to&#xD;
      achieve significance in our primary objective. The estimate was made with the postoperative&#xD;
      mortality rate in Colombia obtained in the study by Hanna et al. of 0.74% (13), an alpha&#xD;
      value of 0.05, an accuracy of 0.5%, and a design effect of 1.2. Also, due to the nature of&#xD;
      the study, it is not possible to randomize. Nevertheless, convenience sampling is considered,&#xD;
      as we aim to include all the patients possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis of the data will be performed. The continuous variables will be&#xD;
      assessed whit normality tests (Shapiro Wilk or Kolmogorov Smirnov). If the variables have a&#xD;
      normal distribution, they will be expressed as mean (measure of central tendency) and as&#xD;
      standard deviation (measure of dispersion). Contrariwise, if the variables have a non-normal&#xD;
      distribution, they will be expressed as median (measure of central tendency) and as&#xD;
      interquartile range (measure of dispersion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous data with normal distribution will be studied with parametric tests according&#xD;
      to the number of comparators: we will use the student t-test or ANOVA if a comparison of more&#xD;
      than two groups is required. For continuous data with non-normal distribution, non-parametric&#xD;
      tests will be used: if two groups are compared, we will use the Mann Whitney test, and&#xD;
      between three groups, the Kruskal Wallis test. The P-value shall be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant &lt; 0,05. Categorical variables shall be presented with absolute frequencies and&#xD;
      proportions. Categorical data will be compared between two groups using the Chi-square test&#xD;
      or fisher's test at convenience to obtain data after collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression will be carried out multilevel by individual, city or municipality,&#xD;
      department, and country. It will evaluate the association between risk factors and primary&#xD;
      outcomes and adjust for differences in confounding factors. A multivariate logistic model&#xD;
      will be created for specific mortality comparisons that include all potential risk factors&#xD;
      associated with in-hospital mortality. The possible risk factors variables with a variance&#xD;
      inflation factor more significant than two were excluded to avoid collinearity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four strategies are proposed to attract interested researchers and institutions to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Because of the support of the Colombian Surgical Association&#xD;
      through the official mail of the organization, a generalized invitation will be sent to all&#xD;
      clinics and hospitals with surgical processes, throughout the country, with general&#xD;
      information of the research study to attract interest from these institutions. Additionally,&#xD;
      the journal and website of the Colombian Surgical Association in both the journal and on the&#xD;
      website of the society of general surgery the registration will be published so students,&#xD;
      interns, doctors, residents, and specialists interested in participating. Finally,&#xD;
      voice-to-voice communication and mass dissemination through ColombianSurg Collaborative&#xD;
      social networks (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Official Website) cannot be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coordination with institutions and departments: A hierarchical management organization was&#xD;
      set up to generate specific and personalized attention to each region and institution (Figure&#xD;
      3). In addition, researchers will be able to communicate with the ColombianSurg Collaborative&#xD;
      team and vice versa through different platforms that will be put at their services, such as&#xD;
      instant messaging groups, email, and official Websites.&#xD;
