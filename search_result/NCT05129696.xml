  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to examine the effects of integrating early child&#xD;
      development group sessions into the existing, at-scale, community health and nutrition&#xD;
      programs administered by the government in Madagascar.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research is a cluster-randomized trial that will assess the effects of integrating early&#xD;
      child development activities on community health worker time use and caregiver time use and&#xD;
      participation in the program. The evaluation will compare the addition of early child&#xD;
      development sessions to the status quo health and nutrition program, with an additional&#xD;
      intervention arm looking at the addition of toys to the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has four objectives, which will be measured at the community health worker level,&#xD;
      and at the caregiver level for caregiver-child dyads (where children are between 6-30 months&#xD;
      old at time of intervention launch):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure how the integration of ECD activities with standard nutrition programming&#xD;
           affects the time and task allocation of the community health workers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the extent, if any, that the addition of ECD activities crowds out community&#xD;
           health worker health/nutrition tasks that are part of the standard community program&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure how the integration of ECD activities affects rates of caregiver participation&#xD;
           in nutrition and health activities over time (e.g., during changes in seasonal&#xD;
           activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measure the impact of enhanced availability and maintenance of age-appropriate play&#xD;
           materials/activities on sustained caregiver participation rates in the program.&#xD;

    <description>Children area offered to participate in bimonthly group sessions. Each session will have materials and activities appropriate for children spanning a 6-month range (6-12 m, 12-18 m, 12-24 m, 24-30 m) and can accommodate a maximum of 10 children per age group. If more households are interested than can be accommodated by the program, interested families will be randomly selected for participation. A total of 40 children per site will be able to participate in the ECD activities at any one time. With bi-monthly meetings, each child will be exposed to 12 sessions for each age group, and is eligible to transition to the next.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for communities:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No other ECD programs present in the community or neighboring communities;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least 40 children monitored at the nutrition center in the target age range of 6-30&#xD;
             months (monitored is defined as attending at least one growth monitoring session&#xD;
             between July 2019 to August 2020);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Stable supervisory presence. Local NGOs are contracted to monitor and supervise all&#xD;
             community health workers and help to strengthen linkages with local structures such as&#xD;
             the community health committees and primary care facilities. Each NGO supervisor is in&#xD;
             charge to up to 9 communities, which they visit twice a month. The investigators&#xD;
             defined stable presence as not having had NGO turnover within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Among the communities included, children 6-30 months were eligible to participate in the&#xD;
        intervention. There was no inclusion criteria for community health workers.&#xD;
