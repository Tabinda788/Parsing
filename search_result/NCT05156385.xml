  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies describe the existence of an association between sexual dysfunction and high&#xD;
      blood pressure (hypertension), most often characterized by a decrease in the number of&#xD;
      orgasms and the existence of dyspareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension is a contributing factor, and nonadherence to medication could amplify it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several ways to assess adherence to treatment: the use of declarative&#xD;
      questionnaires, a method not without criticism because it is subject to the subjectivity of&#xD;
      the declaration by the patient; and drug dosages, a standard technique, although&#xD;
      insufficiently disseminated due to the high cost and greater weight of the survey protocols.&#xD;
      Drug non-compliance is multifactorial. In addition, it has been shown that having undesirable&#xD;
      drug effects and / or being afraid of developing them is one of the major causes of&#xD;
      non-compliance with antihypertensive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that DS is significantly more common among hypertensive women&#xD;
      treated with non-observers compared to hypertensive women treated with observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare the prevalence of sexual dysfunction between a group of&#xD;
      hypertensive women treated as observers and a group of hypertensive women treated as&#xD;
      non-observers.&#xD;
