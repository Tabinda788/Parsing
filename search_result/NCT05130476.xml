  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The parathyroid glands and their blood vessels are notoriously difficult to visualize and may&#xD;
      therefore be unintentionally and irrevocably damaged during thyroid surgery. This project&#xD;
      investigates new surgeon-performed imaging techniques that visualize the parathyroid glands&#xD;
      and their vessels in real-time during thyroid surgery. The purpose is to examine, in a&#xD;
      matched cohort study, whether the implementation of near-infrared-induced autofluorescence&#xD;
      for identification of the parathyroid glands, combined with indocyanine green near-infrared&#xD;
      angiography of the parathyroid feeding vessels, can reduce the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      hypocalcaemia in patients undergoing total and completion thyroidectomy at Odense University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common complication after thyroidectomy is postoperative hypoparathyroidism due to&#xD;
      unintentional intraoperative injury, excision, or devascularisation of the parathyroid&#xD;
      glands. This complication can be either transient (≤6 months), or permanent (&gt; 6 months). The&#xD;
      pooled results from four recent studies from three different Danish university hospitals show&#xD;
      that 117/945 patients (12.4%) suffered from permanent hypoparathyroidism after total and&#xD;
      completion thyroidectomy. This is a very high percentage, considering that the consequences&#xD;
      of hypoparathyroidism and its treatment may be severe and include prolonged hospitalization,&#xD;
      neuromuscular symptoms, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, premature cataracts, seizures,&#xD;
      basal ganglia calcification, and increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism, the standard approach to&#xD;
      thyroidectomy is to keep dissection as close to the thyroid capsule as possible while&#xD;
      visually scrutinizing the surgical field for the parathyroid glands and their delicate&#xD;
      feeding vessels. In spite of these measures, the reported incidences of transient and&#xD;
      permanent hypocalcaemia clearly demonstrate a need to further decrease the risk of&#xD;
      inadvertent injury to the parathyroid glands and their vessels during thyroid surgery. To&#xD;
      achieve this goal, surgeons need a reliable intraoperative aid that can 1) help them identify&#xD;
      the parathyroid glands in vivo and 2) locate their feeding vessels and evaluate their&#xD;
      perfusion in real-time during thyroid surgery. Recently, two near-infrared fluorescence&#xD;
      techniques have emerged, that could potentially meet the requirement of identifying the&#xD;
      parathyroid glands and assessing their vasculature using the same piece of technical&#xD;
      equipment. The techniques are: near-infrared-induced autofluorescence of the parathyroid&#xD;
      glands (NIRAF) for parathyroid identification, and indocyanine green near-infrared&#xD;
      angiography (ICGA) for the assessment of parathyroid vascularization. A recent systematic&#xD;
      review concluded that these most reported-on optical tools for parathyroid identification and&#xD;
      perfusion assessment are favourable for clinical application in terms of being real-time and&#xD;
      non-invasive, having a high sensitivity, an excellent safety profile, and involving no&#xD;
      exposure to ionizing radiation. Prior to a broader implementation, commercially unaffiliated&#xD;
      investigator-initiated studies are needed to evaluate the clinical effect of the bimodal&#xD;
      application of NIRAF and ICGA on the incidence of postoperative hypoparathyroidism after&#xD;
      total and completion thyroidectomy. This study intends to address this need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that near-infrared-induced autofluorescence (NIRAF) combined&#xD;
      with indocyanine green near-infrared angiography (ICGA) of the parathyroid glands can reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism after total and completion thyroidectomy to 1/3&#xD;
      or less of the incidence in a matched retrospective control group.&#xD;
