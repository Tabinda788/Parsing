  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) and to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      preliminary antitumor activity of NDI-101150 given as monotherapy or in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in adult male and female patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, two-part, first-in-human, Phase 1/2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 2 parts study, eligible patients will be enrolled in Part 1 (Dose Escalation Phase:&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NDI-101150 as monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion Phase: designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of NDI-101150 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      disease-specific (gastric and gastroesophageal junction [GEJ] cancer) dose expansion&#xD;
      cohorts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each part of the study will consist of 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Phase of up to 28 days during which patient eligibility will be reviewed and&#xD;
           approved by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Phase that will extend from Cycle 1 Day 1 until progression of disease (PD),&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, start of a new systemic anticancer&#xD;
           treatment, discontinuation of the patient by the Investigator, or termination of the&#xD;
           study by the Sponsor (and will include Safety Follow-up Visit 30 days [+3 days] after&#xD;
           the last dose of investigational medicinal product).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post treatment Follow-up Phase which will continue until lost to follow-up, withdrawal&#xD;
           of consent, or the End of the Study (whichever comes first).&#xD;
