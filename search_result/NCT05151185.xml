    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop the core competence and training model for case&#xD;
      management of dementia. In the previous year (phase I), the needs and competence assessment&#xD;
      stage, the investigators are conducting a survey of the connotation and needs of dementia&#xD;
      case management, and explore the role functions and competencies of dementia case managers as&#xD;
      the basis for developing the training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the second phase of the project. The first year is the establishment of the&#xD;
      training program and the pilot-test stage. The data collected in the previous period will be&#xD;
      integrated to plan a preliminary training program structure, and then the content and&#xD;
      training methods of the training program for dementia case managers will be established using&#xD;
      the Delphi method. Then, use this training program to carry out the pilot test of the&#xD;
      dementia case managers training program. The second year is the project implementation and&#xD;
      effectiveness evaluation stage, the intervention effectiveness evaluation of the training&#xD;
      course for dementia case managers will be conducted. The results of this study will serve as&#xD;
      a reference for the training program of dementia case managers in future.&#xD;

This scale is to rate how well prepared they believe they are for caregiving (Archbold et al.,1990; Huang, Kuo, et al., 2013).&#xD;
This 11-items scale was scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (unprepared) to 5 (well prepared).&#xD;
Scores range from 11 to 55, with higher scores representing greater preparedness for caregiving tasks.&#xD;

    <description>Dementia's behavioral problems were measured by the Chinese version of the CMAI, community form (Cohen-Mansfield, J et al. 1989, 1991, C.K.Y. Lai, pers. comm.).&#xD;
The 43-item CMAI has four subscales that assess four groups of behavioral problems: physically non-aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior, verbally aggressive behavior and verbally non-aggressive behavior.&#xD;
Each item's score ranges from 1 (never happened) to 7 (several times in an hour).&#xD;
Scores can range from 43-301, with higher scores representing more frequent or more types of behavioral problems.&#xD;

For each of the 43 behavioral problems identified by the Chinese version of the CMAI, caregivers are asked how confident they feel about handling the problem.&#xD;
Each AMSS item is scored on a Likert-type scale from 1 (not able to handle at all) to 5 (totally able to handle).&#xD;
Total scores range from 43-215. Higher scores represent greater caregiver self-efficacy to handle behavioral problems.&#xD;
