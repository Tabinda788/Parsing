      Triglyceride glucose index and a reliable alternative marker of insulin resistance and an&#xD;
      independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), which was defined as&#xD;
      the composite of total death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, and&#xD;
      hospitalization because of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesis that there is a relation between prediction of MACE in acute coronary syndrome&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary artery disease (CAD), is considered as a main&#xD;
      cause of death and disability in the developed countries as its responsible for about 1 in&#xD;
      every 5 deaths In the last few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is the most severe ischemic heart disease including&#xD;
      Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and unstable angina&#xD;
      has been one of the leading causes of death worldwide which leads to a large social and&#xD;
      economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been well recognized that the development of (CAD) is driven by multiple factors&#xD;
      including glycemic abnormality and lipid disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin resistance (IR) is a key metabolic abnormality leading to the development of T2DM,&#xD;
      and recent studies have also found that it could independently predict the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp (HIEC), as the gold standard&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of insulin resistance, is very difficult to be carried out in clinical work&#xD;
      due to its difficulty of operation and equipment requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triglyceride and glucose index (TyG index) was one of the alternative methods for evaluating&#xD;
      insulin resistance and is a novel marker Unlike the homeostasis model assessment and&#xD;
      quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, insulin is not included in the TyG index and a&#xD;
      reliable alternative marker of insulin resistance and an independent predictor of major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), which was defined as the composite of total death,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, and hospitalization because of&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TyG index was calculated as the ln (fasting triglyceride level [mg/dL] Ã— fasting glucose&#xD;
      level [mg/dL]/2) Normal cut-off values reported for the TyG in the literature are roughly&#xD;
      around 4 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the value of triglyceride glucose index as a short term predictor of MACE in&#xD;
      diabetic and non diabetic patients presented by Acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
