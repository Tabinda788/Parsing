  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to determine whether there are differences in access to,&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of Ocrelizumab in men and women of different racial and ethnic&#xD;
      origins and socio-economic backgrounds with RRMS and PPMS in two large academic MS Centers&#xD;
      with a high volume of patients on Ocrelizumab. The study is a retrospective analysis of&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis patients cared for at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Boston Medical&#xD;
      Center who were treated with Ocrelizumab during the 4 year study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will be a two-center retrospective/observational analysis with data collected from&#xD;
      the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR), Brigham Multiple Sclerosis Center Patient Database&#xD;
      (Oracle), and Boston Medical Center MS Clinic Database (BMC-MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the Oracle database, BMC-MS database and electronic medical records (EPIC), the&#xD;
      investigators will capture all MS patients who satisfy inclusion criteria. This study will&#xD;
      collect age, sex, race, socio-economic status by residence zip code, disease duration,&#xD;
      previous treatment, current treatment status, the reason for discontinuing or switching to&#xD;
      another treatment, expanded disability status scale (EDSS), and functional systems scores&#xD;
      (FSS) where available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will collect the date, dose, and interval between each&#xD;
      ocrelizumab infusion, as well as any pertinent laboratory values and MRI scan results.&#xD;
