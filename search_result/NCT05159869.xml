  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropsychiatric symptoms are the most difficult, distressing, and burdensome aspects of&#xD;
      dementia care and a catalyst for long-term care placement. Intervention studies have largely&#xD;
      focused on helping caregivers manage these symptoms. However, little has been done with&#xD;
      regard to persons at the earliest stages of dementia, nor have persons with dementia played a&#xD;
      direct and active, central role in helping to design intervention studies. This study focuses&#xD;
      on building, pilot testing, and evaluating a tailored activity plan developed with persons&#xD;
      with early-stage dementia. The goal of the intervention is to provide persons at this early&#xD;
      stage meaningful activities and a plan for adaptation with disease progression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia, a public health crisis, affects 47.5 million people worldwide and is projected to&#xD;
      double in prevalence every 20 years. A degenerative disorder, dementia leads to a decreased&#xD;
      ability to communicate and provide for oneself as the disease progresses, which often results&#xD;
      in unmet needs. Unmet needs that are associated with dementia include boredom/sensory&#xD;
      deprivation, loneliness, and the need for meaningful activity. The inability of persons with&#xD;
      dementia to express or fulfill these needs has a range of adverse outcomes, including the&#xD;
      manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS, e.g., agitation, aggression). As NPS are the&#xD;
      most difficult, distressing, and burdensome aspects of dementia care and a catalyst for&#xD;
      long-term care placement, intervention studies have largely focused on helping caregivers&#xD;
      manage these symptoms. However, little has been done with regard to persons at the earliest&#xD;
      stages of dementia, nor have persons with dementia played a direct and active, central role&#xD;
      in helping to design intervention studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of involvement of persons with dementia as study partners in the co-construction of&#xD;
      interventions results in interventions that may not be relevant to or address the needs of&#xD;
      the very population being targeted. Greater involvement of persons with dementia in&#xD;
      intervention development is now recognized as a critical strategy for enhancing the&#xD;
      relevance, acceptability and reach of interventions. Research suggests that some aspects of&#xD;
      the premorbid sense of self are preserved even in advanced stages of dementia. Failure to&#xD;
      recognize a person with dementia's continued awareness of sense of self can result in missed&#xD;
      opportunities for involvement as a study partner as well as for developing effective&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions. Thus, engaging persons with dementia in intervention development&#xD;
      in the early stages of the disease can increase the likelihood that interventions are&#xD;
      meaningful and linked to a sense of self throughout disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes persons with early-stage dementia in the development of a meaningful&#xD;
      activity plan. Prior activity intervention studies have primarily targeted participants at a&#xD;
      moderate or later stage of dementia; consequently, persons with early dementia have largely&#xD;
      been underrepresented in this line of research. As meaningful activity is considered central&#xD;
      to the well-being of persons with dementia and is known to decrease negative emotions, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that activity rooted in the interests and values of persons with early dementia&#xD;
      will facilitate well-being as the disease progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are as follows: 1) To identify delivery characteristics of an activity&#xD;
      intervention for persons with dementia at the early stage, 2) To evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and initial potential benefits of this protocol, and 3) To evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the revised protocol and examine its effects on outcomes. An exploratory aim&#xD;
      evaluates whether activities are used independently of the intervention. The first aim will&#xD;
      be accomplished through a series of focus groups with persons with dementia using best&#xD;
      practices for inclusion, where participants will assist in identifying the key delivery&#xD;
      characteristics participants would like to see in an intervention involving purposeful and&#xD;
      meaningful activity. This aim will result in a proto-type intervention protocol, which will&#xD;
      be evaluated through the second aim with approximately 10 persons with early stage dementia.&#xD;
      Findings of this open-label trial will then be shared with key informants and an expert&#xD;
      panel, and the protocol revised as needed based on feedback. The revised, testable protocol&#xD;
      will be submitted to further testing via a pilot, two-group randomized trial with 60&#xD;
      community-dwelling persons with early-stage dementia (aim 3). Outcomes examined will include&#xD;
      well-being, sense of control, frequency and severity of NPS, sense of self, and cognition.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The third phase of the study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial exploring the design and feasibility of a novel approach to dementia intervention development. Using a two-group randomized, parallel design, 60 persons with dementia will be assigned to treatment (the collaborative creation of a tailored activity plan) or wait-list control. Treatment group participants will receive the activity plan intervention, and will be reassessed at six months from baseline as well as 12 months. There will also be a &quot;check-in&quot; after three months' time. After four months, wait-list controls will receive the same intervention and will be reassessed at six and 12 months from baseline. This design allows for estimation of effect sizes using a randomized two-group design at four months, confirmation of treatment gains for wait-listed participants from four to 12 months, and evaluation of intervention acceptability for all 60 participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Premorbid cognitive function as assessed by the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>General intellectual abilities/premorbid cognitive functioning will be assessed via the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR). The WTAR is composed of 50 irregularly spelled words and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The test is discontinued when the participant provides 12 consecutive incorrect pronunciations. Each correct pronunciation is given a score of 1, and raw scores range from 0-50 with higher scores indicating higher premorbid cognitive function. The raw score is standardized by age and a scaled score is obtained by comparing to the participant's score to normative data based on their demographic classification.</description>

    <measure>Change in the cognitive domain of attention as assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Attention will be assessed via the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) digit span subtests. Digit Span Forward requires participants to repeat series of digits of increasing length in the same order as the examiner (score range: 0-12, with higher scores indicating better attention). Digit Span Backward requires participants to repeat series of digits of increasing length in the reverse order of the examiner (score range: 0-12, with higher scores indicating better attention). Digit Span Sequencing requires participants to sequentially order the numbers presented by the examiner (score range: 0-12, with higher scores indicating better attention and working memory). Every series on each digit span subtest consists of two trials, each of which is scored 1 or 0 points. Administration is discontinued when the participant scores 0 on both trials of an item. Raw scores are converted to a scaled score and percentile rank based on normative data.</description>

    <measure>Change in the cognitive domain of executive function as assessed by the Stroop Color-Word Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function will be assessed via the Stroop Color-Word Test. The Stroop contains a word page (the names of colors printed in black ink), a color page (rows of Xs printed in colored ink), and a word-color page (the words from the first page are printed in the colors from the second page, but the word meanings and ink colors are mismatched). Each page has five columns containing 20 items. The participant must look at each sheet and move down the columns, reading words or naming the ink colors as quickly as possible, within a time limit of 45 seconds. Three scores, as well as an interference score, are generated using the number of items completed on each page, with higher scores reflecting better performance and less interference on reading ability. Raw scores are converted to a scaled score and percentile rank based on normative data.</description>

    <measure>Change in the cognitive domain of memory and learning as assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function will be assessed via the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). Participants will hear a list of 16 nouns, read at one-second intervals, in fixed order, over five learning trials (list A). After each trial, the subject is asked to recall as many words as they can in any order. List B, an interference list that shares two categories from List A and has two unshared categories, is then presented. Free and cued recall of list A are tested immediately (short-delay), and again after 20 minutes (long-delay). A higher number of words (range 0-16) recalled for free and cued immediate and delayed recall indicate more intact memory and new learning abilities.</description>

    <measure>Change in the cognitive domain of immediate memory and learning as assessed by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status list learning subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Immediate memory and new learning will be assessed via the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) subtest of list learning. In list learning, 10 semantically unrelated words are orally and visually presented to the subject. The words are presented visually in lowercase letters at a two-second rate. Within the two seconds, each word is visible to the subject for 1.25 seconds, followed by a 0.75-second interval between one word and the next. The examiner reads the words aloud when they appear on the screen so the subject receives audio-visual information. The subject is asked to repeat as many words as possible after each of four learning trials. A higher number of words recalled (range 0-16) indicate more intact immediate memory. Raw scores are converted to a scaled score and percentile rank based on normative data.</description>

    <measure>Change in the cognitive domains of memory and learning as assessed by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status Story Memory subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Memory and new learning will be assessed via the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) subtest story memory. Story Memory is a twelve-item short story presented over two trials. The story is presented visually in three separate parts and read aloud simultaneously at a slow reading speed. After each presentation, the subject is asked to recall as much of the story as he or she can remember, with more items recalled indicating more intact immediate memory. A verbatim criterion is used. Raw scores are converted to a scaled score and percentile rank based on normative data.</description>

    <measure>Change in the cognitive domain of language as assessed by the Controlled Oral Word Association test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Language, specifically verbal fluency, will be assessed via the Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) test. Participants are asked to come up with as many words as possible that begin with a given letter within a one-minute time period. Participants are also instructed to exclude proper nouns, numbers, and the same word with a different suffix. The number of correct responses is totaled, with higher numbers indicating greater verbal fluency, and the sum compared with normative data.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the cognitive domain of language as assessed by the Boston Naming Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Language will be assessed via the Boston Naming Test (BNT). Participants are asked to name 60 line drawings of objects of graded difficulty, ranging from very common objects to less familiar ones. Objects must be spontaneously named within a 20-second period. If this time limit expires, two kinds of prompting cues (one phonemic, one semantic) may be given. Rules allow for discontinuation and for starting the test at an advanced level, thus saving considerable time for subjects without obvious impairment. The examiner will then total the number of spontaneously produced correct responses, the number of cues given, and the number of responses after phonemic cuing and after semantic cuing. A higher number of correct spontaneous responses indicates more intact language skills. Scores will be compared to normative data.</description>

    <measure>Frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with dementia as assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms is measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) as reported by the primary care partner. The NPI is comprised of twelve domains, and each of the domains contains a survey question that reflects key symptoms of that domain. Initial responses to each domain question are &quot;Yes&quot; (present) or &quot;No&quot; (absent). If the response to the domain question is &quot;No&quot;, the examiner proceeds to the next question.</description>

    <measure>Severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with dementia as assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms is measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) as reported by the primary care partner. The NPI is comprised of twelve domains, and each of the domains contains a survey question that reflects key symptoms of that domain. Initial responses to each domain question are &quot;Yes&quot; (present) or &quot;No&quot; (absent). If the response to the domain question is &quot;No&quot;, the examiner proceeds to the next question. If &quot;Yes&quot;, the examiner asks the proxy informant to rate both the Severity of the symptoms present within the last month on a 3-point scale and the associated impact of the symptom manifestations on care partner distress level using a 5-point scale. The NPI-Q provides symptom Severity and Distress ratings for each symptom reported, and total Severity and Distress scores reflecting the sum of individual domain scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in sense of self as assessed by the Identity-Alzheimer Moderate Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sense of self in persons with dementia will be measured by the Identity-Alzheimer Moderate test (I-AM). This requires participants to complete 20 sentences beginning with &quot;I Am...&quot; Due to the population under study, the sentences will be completed orally, i.e., dictated to the examiner. Responses will be scored according to the scheme developed by Watkins et al. Scoring categories include idiocentric, small-group, large-group, and allocentric responses. Scores are calculated for the overall number of statements generated, the number of responses belonging to each category or subcategory, the emotional valence, and the number of different categories/subcategories.</description>

    <measure>Change in sense of self as assessed by the IMAGE Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sense of self in persons with dementia will be measured by the IMAGE test (denoted only by the acronym IMAGE). This test is comprised of 24 descriptive statements, 21 of which refer to the concepts of identity, behavior, and self-satisfaction. Each component contains seven statements belonging to one of seven self-concept domains (moral-ethical, social, personal, physical, family, cognition, emotion). Responses are scored on a four-point Likert scale as follows: 1=totally false, 2=partly false, 3=partly true, and 4=totally true. The total score was obtained by summing all items (maximum score = 96), with higher scores indicating more intact sense of self in a given domain.</description>

    <description>After participants are recruited, participants will undergo neuropsychological testing prior to randomization in order to establish baseline cognitive functioning and verify that the participants are indeed in the early stages of dementia. Persons randomized to the User-Led Meaningful Activity intervention group will begin the treatment protocol right after randomization. The intervention will consist of 3-4 sessions lasting 60-90 minutes each in which participants receive feedback from the neuropsychological assessment, identify the basis/topic of the activity plan, receive dementia psychoeducation, and map out an activity gradation plan. A brief cognitive screening tool will be re-administered at six months and 12 months. The neuropsychological battery that was administered at baseline will be re-administered 12 months later. Follow-up will also involve solicitation of feedback from the person with dementia and his or her caregiver regarding participants' participation in the study.</description>

    <description>After participants are recruited, participants will undergo neuropsychological testing prior to randomization in order to establish baseline cognitive functioning and verify that the participants are indeed in the early stages of dementia (i.e., &quot;mild&quot; dementia). Those who meet criteria will be randomly assigned. Persons randomized to the wait-list control group will begin the treatment protocol after four months' time.</description>

    <intervention_name>User-Led Meaningful Activity Plan</intervention_name>
    <description>The User-Led Meaningful Activity Plan integrates persons with dementia as partners in the co-construction of an intervention involving personally meaningful activity. Activities are graded to correspond with disease progression. For example, (1) an individual who is/was a researcher may continue to maintain a job, conduct research, and even publish papers in the early stages of dementia. (2) As the dementia progresses, he or she may be able to continue to run analyses and read/access literature in his or her field. (3) In the moderate stages of dementia, this participant may read his or her existing publications or go to museums showcasing research of interest. As the disease approaches the severe stage, the participant may read very basic books about his or her former profession. (4) In the severe stages of dementia, this study participant may watch videos related to the former profession, e.g., British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) or National Geographic.</description>

             anti-dementia medication (memantine or a cholinesterase inhibitor), the investigators&#xD;
             will require that participants have been on a stable dose for 60 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment (typical time frame in clinical trials) to minimize possible confounding&#xD;
             effects of concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia in the moderate or severe stages&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bed-boundedness, defined as confined to bed or chair for at least 22 hours a day for&#xD;
             at least four of the previous seven days&#xD;
