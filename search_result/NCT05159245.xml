      This is a prospective non-randomized national clinical phase 2 trial that aims to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy and toxicity of commercially available EMA approved targeted anticancer drugs or&#xD;
      combinations for treatment of patients with advanced cancer with a potentially actionable&#xD;
      variant as revealed by a genomic, RNA-molecular or protein expression test.&#xD;

      This is a prospective non-randomized clinical trial that aims to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity of commercially available EMA approved targeted anticancer drugs or combinations for&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced cancer with a potentially actionable variant as revealed&#xD;
      by a genomic, RNA-molecular or protein expression test. The study also aims to facilitate&#xD;
      patient access to approved targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by&#xD;
      collaborating pharmaceutical companies and to perform next generation sequencing and further&#xD;
      deeper analysis on tumor biopsies and/or liquid biopsies for biomarker analyses and&#xD;
      resistance mechanisms. Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor for which standard&#xD;
      treatment options no longer exist and acceptable performance status and organ function. A&#xD;
      tumour DNA, RNA or protein expression analysis is required and the results must identify at&#xD;
      least one potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Molecular&#xD;
      profiling will be utilized to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in&#xD;
      the protocol. Drug selection will be guided by a list of potential profiles, the molecular&#xD;
      tumor board and databases of identified targets for review and approval of the recommended&#xD;
      treatment. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any&#xD;
      drug-specific eligibility criteria and overall study criteria are met. Data for standard&#xD;
      efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as&#xD;
      duration of treatment will be collected for all patients receiving treatment within the&#xD;
      trial. In addition, treatment related toxicity will be collected according to CTCAE 5.0.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult (age &gt;18 years) patient with a histologically-confirmed locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic solid tumor including lymphoma who is no longer benefitting from standard&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined below. However, specific&#xD;
             inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in the drug-specific study manual will take&#xD;
             precedence:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 mmol/l&#xD;

               3. Platelets &gt; 75 x 109/l&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. AST and ALT &lt; 3 x institutional ULN (or &lt; 5 x ULN in patients with known hepatic&#xD;
                  metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 40&#xD;
                  mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have objectively evaluable or measurable disease (by physical or&#xD;
             radiographic examination, according to RECIST v1.1 for patients with solid tumors, or&#xD;
             according to Lugano, RANO, PCWG3 or GCIG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Results must be available from a tumor molecular profiling. Eligible tests may include&#xD;
             any of the following technologies: fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), next&#xD;
             generation sequencing (NGS) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). The test may have been&#xD;
             performed on the primary tumor or a metastatic lesion, in a diagnostic laboratory or&#xD;
             within the context of another commercial platform (eg Foundation Medicine), and must&#xD;
             reveal a potentially actionable variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a tumor profile for which treatment with one of the EMA approved&#xD;
             (or under revision for approval) targeted anti-cancer drugs included in this study has&#xD;
             potential clinical benefit based on preclinical data or clinical information (see&#xD;
             section 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A new (obtained ≤6 months before inclusion after which no further anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             is allowed) fresh frozen and FFPE tumor biopsy specimen or liquid biopsy for extensive&#xD;
             biomarker testing is mandatory before the start of treatment with a targeted agent&#xD;
             included in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             and comply to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral&#xD;
             medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Because of the risks of drug treatment to the developing fetus, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation, and for four&#xD;
             months following completion of study therapy. Male patients should avoid impregnating&#xD;
             a female partner. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e. post-vasectomy)&#xD;
             must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during&#xD;
             the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug, or completely abstain from sexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ongoing toxicity &gt; grade 2, other than alopecia or &gt; grade 1 neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is receiving any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or&#xD;
             hormonal other than for replacement). Required wash out period prior to starting study&#xD;
             treatment is at least two weeks. An exception is made for:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients suffering from CRPC are allowed to continue androgen deprivation&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an&#xD;
                  anti-cancer effect (e.g., megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates). These medications&#xD;
                  must have been started ≥ 1 week prior to enrollment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with known active progressive brain metastases. Patients with previously&#xD;
             treated brain metastases are eligible, provided that the patient is clinically stable&#xD;
             and off steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with clinically significant preexisting cardiac conditions, including&#xD;
             uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, uncontrolled atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45% are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with stroke (including TIA) or acute myocardial infarction within 3 months&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with any other clinically significant medical condition which, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the treating physician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the&#xD;
             study or which could jeopardize compliance with study requirements including, but not&#xD;
             limited to: ongoing or active infection, significant uncontrolled hypertension, or&#xD;
             severe psychiatric illness/social situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For each drug included in this protocol, specific inclusion and exclusion criteria (based&#xD;
        on the Package Insert or manufacturers recommendations) may also apply. These can be found&#xD;
        in the supplemental information for each agent included in the drug-specific study manuals.&#xD;
        Drug-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will take precedence over the&#xD;
        inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above.&#xD;
