  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination is the best way to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but&#xD;
      the vaccine immunogenicity may be quite variable from person to person. There is increasing&#xD;
      evidence suggesting that the gut microbiome is a major determinant of vaccine immunogenicity.&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators investigated the relationship between gut microbiota and humoral&#xD;
      immune response after COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;

    <description>From Febrary 25, 2021 to July 16, 2021, healthy healthcare workers were prospectively recruited at a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea, and they were assigned to get ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) (n=26) vaccines. Participants were excluded if they had history of medication which would affect gut microbiota in the past 1 month, including antibiotics, laxatives, and motility drugs; previous history of positive SARS-CoV-2 test on nasopharyngeal PCR; or positive serum Spike IgG results.</description>
