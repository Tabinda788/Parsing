      Firalis SA and its affiliate Amoneta Diagnostics SAS are developing novel in-vitro diagnostic&#xD;
      (IVD) tests for diverse diagnostic applications for major human diseases, including&#xD;
      cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. These tests measure in blood and other&#xD;
      peripheral body fluids; long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs),&#xD;
      messenger RNAs (mRNAs), circulating proteins, lipids and metabolites. In addition, since&#xD;
      2020, Firalis is producing the salivary test EasyCOV for detection of Covid-19 positivity in&#xD;
      both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Firalis group is the sponsor of a pipeline of&#xD;
      various clinical studies conducted in diverse National and European clinical sites of&#xD;
      excellence, enrolling patients affected by the targeted diseases studied such as acute&#xD;
      myocardial injury, Alzheimer disease for the proof of performance phase of the biomarkers and&#xD;
      IVD test candidates. The present specific study aims to collect biological samples to&#xD;
      complete the analytical validation of its diverse IVD tools namely the evaluation of the&#xD;
      stability of the biomarkers and the effect of age, gender, nutrition and inter-period on the&#xD;
      expression level of the studied biomarkers.&#xD;
