  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bile reflux gastropathy is caused by the backward flow of duodenal fluid into the stomach. A&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study was performed to declare if the therapeutic biliary interventions&#xD;
      cause bile reflux gastropathy, and to estimate its prevalence and risk factors, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the gastric mucosa endoscopic and histopathologic changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bile reflux gastropathy is a pathological condition in the form of the backward flow of&#xD;
      duodenal fluid that consists of bile, pancreatic juices, and secretions of the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa into the stomach and esophagus, causing mucosal lesions. Bile acids, in combination&#xD;
      with gastric acid, have been shown to cause bile reflux gastropathy symptoms (heartburn,&#xD;
      regurgitation, epigastric pain, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile reflux gastropathy frequently occurs after gastric surgeries that that damages the&#xD;
      pyloric sphincter, and after biliary surgeries and procedures as cholecystectomy, endoscopic&#xD;
      sphincterotomy (EST), endoscopic stenting, or choledochoduodenostomy that cause the sphincter&#xD;
      of Oddi malfunction.[4] Bile gastropathy is a normal physiological event in a prolonged&#xD;
      fasting period (primary bile reflux gastropathy).In non-responsive individuals to PPI&#xD;
      medication, the total prevalence of biliary reflux was 68.7%. These people have acid and bile&#xD;
      reflux at the same time and have never had biliary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) became an increasingly popular modality&#xD;
      for both the diagnosis and the treatment of biliary tract disorders. It represents one of the&#xD;
      most demanding and technically challenging procedures in gastrointestinal endoscopy, which&#xD;
      must be performed effectively and safely by operators with substantial training and&#xD;
      experience to maximize success and safety. Cholecystectomy is a surgical operation of&#xD;
      gallbladder removal. It can be performed either laparoscopically, using a video camera, or&#xD;
      via an open surgical technique. Pain and complications caused by gallstones are the most&#xD;
      common reasons for cholecystectomy.&#xD;

    <description>Gastric mucosa alterations as erythema, bile existence in the stomach, gastric folds thickening, erosions, and petechiae were also recorded (Olympus single-channel CLK-4). Multiple biopsies were taken from gastric mucosa for histopathological study. Via Triple Lumen ERCP Cannula, 5 mL of gastric fluid was aspirated through the suction channel of the endoscope and collected in a sterile trap placed in the suction line, to be sent for analysis. Quantitative determination of gastric aspirate total bilirubin level was performed (Gen.3® kit and Cobas 8000 analyzer). The pH monitoring of gastric aspirate was performed during the gastroscopy just after collection with a glass electrode pH meter (Adwa®).</description>
