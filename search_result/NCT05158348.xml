      A comparative study to measure the effect of nebulized dexmedetomidine - lidocaine for&#xD;
      controlling postoperative pain after tonsillectomy in adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most common procedures in ear, nose, and throat surgery. It is&#xD;
      usually performed as a day-stay procedure. [1] Pain is the most common reason for physician&#xD;
      contact after discharge, indicating that post-tonsillectomy pain is intense and undertreated.&#xD;
      [2] Patients need analgesics that are effective and can be used safely at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults have a different pattern of pain compared with children; this is related to the&#xD;
      different indications and techniques of tonsillectomy. [3, 4] In adults, the surgery is&#xD;
      usually performed for chronic infection with scarred tonsils that requires dissection with&#xD;
      coagulation, thus causing intense and longer-lasting pain. [5] In children, the indication is&#xD;
      usually hypertrophy or recurrent acute infections with smaller changes in tonsil tissues than&#xD;
      in adults. [6] Multimodal analgesia has become the standard of care in postoperative pain&#xD;
      management. Combinations of analgesics with different sites or modes of action are commonly&#xD;
      used to improve analgesia and to reduce the doses of individual analgesics (especially&#xD;
      opioids) and to reduce adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic reviews on various analgesics for post-tonsillectomy pain have been published for&#xD;
      paediatric and adolescent patients.(7,8) Paracetamol (alone and in combination with&#xD;
      ibuprofen)NSAIDS,dexamethasone or gabapentenoids(9) Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective&#xD;
      adrenergic Î±-2 agonist that does not cause respiratory depression and can be used as a&#xD;
      sedative for various procedures. [10,11] Recently, the use of dexmedetomidine as an additive&#xD;
      to local anaesthetics was reported to have several advantages over conventional intravenous&#xD;
      administration. [12,13]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nebulized dexmedetomidine combined with other anaesthetics as a premedication for outpatient&#xD;
      paediatric dental procedures has also been reported to provide smoother induction of general&#xD;
      anaesthesia with a more rapid recovery and no significant side effects. [14] Nebulized&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine-lidocaine inhalation as a premedication for flexible bronchoscopy was well&#xD;
      tolerated during bronchoscopies performed under moderate sedation and was associated with a&#xD;
      reduced incidence of moderate to severe coughing, a shorter recovery time and reduced&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor consumption(15).However, there are no data regarding the use of nebulized&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine-lidocaine for controlling postoperative pain after tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative study II. Study setting and location This study will be conducted at Kasr Al-Ainy&#xD;
      tertiary Hospital, Cairo University after being approved by the anesthesia department&#xD;
      Research committee and obtaining written informed consent of patients III. Study population&#xD;
      60 patients undergoing tonsillectomy operation will be enrolled in this study divided into 3&#xD;
      groups each of 20 patients. Group A will receive intra-operative local infiltration of saline&#xD;
      in tonsillar bed and post-operative nebulised dexametomidine and lidocaine. Group B will&#xD;
      receive intra-operative local infiltration of saline and post-operative will receive&#xD;
      nebulised lidocaine and group C will receive intra-operative local infiltration of lidocaine&#xD;
      and post-operative nebulised saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion criteria Patients of either sex, aged between 18-50 years old, ASA physical&#xD;
           status I, II undergoing tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria Patients were excluded if they had clinically important coronary&#xD;
           atherosclerotic heart disease, a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, Sinus&#xD;
           bradycardia or heart block, coagulopathy, peritonsillar abscess, any infection at the&#xD;
           site of injection, Known allergy to the study drugs (lidocaine, dexmedetomidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Randomization (in RCT only) All procedures will be performed by the same team, which&#xD;
      include an ENT surgeon using the same technique in all study groups which is dissecting the&#xD;
      tonsils by bipolar diathermy technique and surgeon will do the infiltration technique also&#xD;
      and a specialized anaesthesiologist for the inhalational technique ,the patients will be&#xD;
      informed about the procedure ,technique of the intra-operative and post-operative pain&#xD;
      control and the VAS scoring system before the operation. Randomization and drug masking will&#xD;
      be completed by a specialist who will not be directly involved in the trials. The patients&#xD;
      will be divided into 3 groups; Group A will receive intra-operative local infiltration of&#xD;
      saline in tonsillar bed and post-operative nebulised dexametomidine and lidocaine. Group B&#xD;
      will receive intra-operative local infiltration of saline and post-operative will receive&#xD;
      nebulised lidocaine and group C will receive intra-operative local infiltration of lidocaine&#xD;
      and post-operative nebulised saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol Upon arrival to the operating room, a pulse oximetry, capnography, continuous&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), and non-invasive blood pressure measurement device will be connected&#xD;
      to the patient. A large bore cannula will be inserted. Pre-medications will be given;&#xD;
      Antiemetics as metclopromide(10mg) or dexamethasone(8mg) to decrease laryngeal edema&#xD;
      postoperatively. Anesthesia will be induced with IV Propofol, 1.5 mg/kg and IV fentanyl 1&#xD;
      mic/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. Patients will be intubated and ventilated with oxygen&#xD;
      maintaining ETCO2 at 35-40 mmHg. Anesthesia will be maintained with oxygen, isoflurane and&#xD;
      atracurium providing muscle relaxation as a maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A will receive intra-operative local infiltration of saline in tonsillar bed by&#xD;
           the surgeon and post-operative nebulised dexametomidine(0.6mic per kg) and lidocaine(1&#xD;
           mic per kg)by specialized anesthesiologist. Group B will receive intra-operative local&#xD;
           infiltration of saline by the surgeon and post-operative will receive neublised&#xD;
           lidocaine(1 mic per kg) by specialized anesthesiologist and group C will receive&#xD;
           intra-operative local infiltration of lidocaine(1 mic per kg) in the tonsillar bed by&#xD;
           the surgeon and post-operative nebulised saline by the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
