      Background: Left uterine displacement (LUD) has been questioned as an effective strategy to&#xD;
      prevent aortocaval compression after spinal anesthesia (SA) for cesarean delivery (CD). The&#xD;
      investigators tested if LUD has a significant impact on cardiac output (CO) in patients&#xD;
      undergoing CD under SA during continuous non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Forty-six patients were included in the final analysis. The investigators considered&#xD;
      4 timepoints of 5 minutes each: T1=baseline with LUD; T2=baseline without LUD; T3=after SA&#xD;
      with LUD; T4=after SA without LUD. LUD was then repositioned for CD. Primary outcome was to&#xD;
      test if CO decreased from T3 to T4. We also compared CO between T1 and T2 and other&#xD;
      hemodynamic variables: mean, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (respectively MAP, SAP and&#xD;
      DAP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure&#xD;
      variation (PPV), contractility (dP/dt), dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn) at the different&#xD;
      timepoints. Data on fetal Apgar scores and umbilical arterial and venous pH were collecte&#xD;

      The primary outcome was to test if CO decreases significantly after LUD removal in patients&#xD;
      under SA for CD. This is a prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were gathered from pregnant patients who, in addition to standard monitoring, underwent&#xD;
      perioperative non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring by ClearSight system on the Edwards&#xD;
      Lifesciences HemoSphere platform (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters were recorded at 20 seconds-intervals. The investigators considered 4&#xD;
      timepoints. T1 were the baseline values recorded for 5 minutes, after initial stabilization&#xD;
      of parameters, with the patient laying down on the operating table with LUD. At T2, LUD was&#xD;
      removed and we considered for the analysis hemodynamic data of the subsequent 5 minutes. The&#xD;
      investigators indicated as T3 the 5 minutes following SA with a satisfactory sensory block&#xD;
      and as T4 the subsequent 5 minutes following LUD removal. Figure 1 summarizes the timepoints&#xD;
      of our analysis. LUD was accomplished by positioning a wooden wedge wrapped with cotton, to&#xD;
      make it comfortable, and medical sheets with a measured angle of 15° under the right flank of&#xD;
      the laying down patient. In all patients, after T4 the 15° wooden wedge was positioned again&#xD;
      and surgery was performed with LUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was standard spinal procedure, fluid management was left to the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending anesthesiologist was blinded to the advanced hemodynamic parameters from the&#xD;
      ClearSight system except for the continuous BP values. The investigators defined hypotension&#xD;
      as an absolute value of MAP &lt; 65 mmHg. This value was considered as trigger for the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist for the administration of norepinephrine 5 mcg. Norepinephrine boluses were&#xD;
      repeated to reach a MAP&gt;65mmHg. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate of &lt; 60 bpm. Atropine&#xD;
      0.5 mg was administered for the treatment of bradycardia combined with hypotension, or for an&#xD;
      absolute value of heart rate &lt; 45 bpm. After delivery, Oxytocin was administered to&#xD;
      facilitate the uterine contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also evaluated the impact of maternal blood pressure and CO on fetal outcome collecting&#xD;
      neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth, and umbilical cord arterial and venous&#xD;
      pH.&#xD;
