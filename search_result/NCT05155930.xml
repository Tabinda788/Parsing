      Evaluation study of IFS therapy among trauma-impacted adults in order to explore the&#xD;
      applicability of IFS with this population, ensure fidelity of treatment administration, and&#xD;
      examine initial efficacy. Evaluate the utility of IFS in reducing symptoms of PTSD,&#xD;
      dissociation and depression and increasing self-regulatory capacity, self-awareness and&#xD;
      self-compassion. 15 subjects between the ages of 18 and 56 who are receiving 16, 90-minute&#xD;
      sessions of IFS therapy by certified IFS practitioners in the community will be recruited for&#xD;
      this evaluation study. Blind evaluators will assess treatment effects at pre-treatment,&#xD;
      mid-treatment, post-treatment and at one-month follow-up, measuring change in symptoms of&#xD;
      PTSD, dissociation and depression, as well as self-regulation, self-compassion, and&#xD;
      interoceptive awareness.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Internal Family Systems (IFS) model of psychotherapy is a trauma-informed promising practice that has shown promise for individuals who struggle with trauma related symptoms including PTSD, dissociation and depression, as well as disruptions in self-concept and self-regulation. IFS places a heavy emphasis on aiding individuals in building an internalized sense of self-efficacy and self-compassion that may then support the development of self-regulatory capacity and reductions in trauma-related symptoms.</intervention_model_description>
