    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacologic treatment, alone&#xD;
      and combined, for improvements in weight loss, cardiovascular risk factors, and psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning following metabolic and bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic and bariatric surgery is currently the most effective treatment for severe obesity;&#xD;
      however, a substantial proportion of patients attain suboptimal weight losses and continue to&#xD;
      struggle with obesity, weight regain, and related medical comorbidities after surgery. Thus,&#xD;
      this study aims to perform a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a rigorous manualized behavioral weight loss treatment and a FDA-approved&#xD;
      weight loss agent (naltrexone+bupropion), alone and in combination, for improving weight&#xD;
      loss, cardiovascular risk factors, and psychosocial functioning after metabolic and bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. This study will produce important new clinical findings regarding the utility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and behavioral weight loss for a rapidly growing obesity&#xD;
      subgroup and will inform care models for managing chronic and refractory obesity to enhance&#xD;
      outcomes after metabolic and bariatric surgery.&#xD;
