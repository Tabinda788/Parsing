  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to bridge the knowledge-to-action gap regarding psychosocial treatment&#xD;
      &quot;dosing&quot; for youth with bipolar disorder (BD). In psychiatry, pragmatic collaborative&#xD;
      decisions between patient and care provider about pharmacological titrations and tapers are&#xD;
      common. Less frequently are there considerations made regarding the pragmatic dosing of&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions. Whereas some youth clearly require full/&quot;high-dose&quot; treatment,&#xD;
      others may benefit from &quot;lower-dose&quot; interventions, alongside re-evaluation of dosing needs&#xD;
      over time. Furthermore, there is a subset of youth who do not require or do not want the&#xD;
      intensity and frequency of treatment that current interventions provide. This research&#xD;
      presents a unique opportunity to better understand different levels of care within a&#xD;
      subspecialized outpatient mental health clinic serving youth with BD who vary greatly in&#xD;
      terms of risk indicators, type and severity of symptoms, associated distress, and compounding&#xD;
      functional impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) in adolescence is associated with poor outcomes, including impaired&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning, substance use, and suicidality. Preliminary data using DBT as a&#xD;
      treatment for youth BD shows improvement in depression symptoms and suicidality. At the same&#xD;
      time, the reality is that BD is a chronic disease, and it stands to reason that a pragmatic,&#xD;
      adaptive management approach is warranted. Developing a multi-level DBT-informed approach is&#xD;
      advantageous for a number of reasons, in particular because this approach embraces clinical&#xD;
      heterogeneity within and between individuals. Whereas some youth clearly require&#xD;
      full/&quot;high-dose&quot; treatment, others may benefit from judicious use of &quot;lower-dose&quot;&#xD;
      interventions, alongside re-evaluation of dosing needs over time. Furthermore, there is a&#xD;
      subset of youth who do not require and/or do not want the intensity and frequency of&#xD;
      treatment that current interventions provide. Thus far, the leading evidence-based&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment studies in the field of youth BD have taken an &quot;all or nothing&quot;&#xD;
      approach and have only been studied at one dosing level. While such an approach has certain&#xD;
      advantages, it lacks person-centered consideration regarding pragmatic dosing. This study&#xD;
      endeavors to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a multi-level treatment model&#xD;
      with dosing decisions driven by a combination of risk indicators and symptom severity (with&#xD;
      an emphasis on emotional dysregulation, suicidality, and functional impairment; key treatment&#xD;
      targets in dialectical behavior therapy), along with patient preference. This study proposes&#xD;
      to implement three intensity levels of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)-informed&#xD;
      intervention that differ in regards to the number and frequency of sessions, parental&#xD;
      involvement, and treatment components. This research will seek to understand the outcomes of&#xD;
      three different levels of therapy and will examine what factors lead to the escalation of DBT&#xD;
      dosing levels in this population.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is targeted toward youth with BD who, at intake, do not want and/or require full DBT. Participants will be enrolled into Level 1 - Enhanced Care or Level 2 - DBT Skills Training; for those whose circumstances change during the course of the study, such that they want and/or require full dose DBT, the intervention also includes potential dose escalation up through Level 3 - DBT Full Intervention. As the levels escalate, frequency of therapy sessions and contact with study therapist will increase. Dosing decisions will be driven by a combination of risk indicators and symptom severity, with an emphasis on emotional dysregulation, suicidality, and functional impairment, along with patient preference. Participants who are initially enrolled into Levels 1 or 2 will be able to escalate to Level 3 up until the end of their first year of enrollment. This is to ensure that they will have time to receive one full year of the DBT intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Children's Affective Lability Scale (CALS) is a reliable 20-item adolescent- and parent-reported measure of mood lability, derived from the adult Affective Lability Scale that was specifically designed for adults with BD. It yields a total score as well as an angry/depressed factor and a disinhibited/impersistent factor. Total scores can vary from 0 to 80, with lower scores indicating a lesser degree of affective lability.</description>

    <intervention_name>Enhanced Care</intervention_name>
    <description>Enhanced care aims to educate participants about bipolar disorder using a didactic approach, in addition to teaching and practicing DBT skills in an applied and relevant manner based on the participant's needs. Participants will receive a total of four sessions (approx. 60 minutes in duration), to occur once a month, at a minimum. The content will be split up into psychoeducation (2 sessions) and selected DBT skills (2 sessions). Psychoeducation will be specific to youth bipolar disorder, covering topics such as symptoms of depression and hypo/mania, medications used to treat bipolar disorder, the role of biology and the environment in emotions, and vulnerability and protective factors to emotion dysregulation and mood episodes. The content of skills sessions will be individualized and based on participant needs and goals (e.g., learning and applying skills to optimize their overall functioning, address problem behaviors and/or stressors, and/or maintain commitment to treatment).</description>

    <description>In DBT Skills Training, participants will only receive skills training and can choose to do this individually and/or with their individual family unit by including their parent(s) and/or sibling(s). Participants will receive 15-20 sessions (approx. 60 minutes in duration), to occur at least biweekly. Skills training will include the five standard youth DBT modules: psychoeducation about DBT and bipolar disorder, mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and walking the middle path. The primary focus of the skills training is to impart knowledge and acquire and strengthen pragmatic skills to replace dysfunctional behaviors. If participants choose to include their family members, they will be encouraged to coach one another in effective use of skills.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dialectical Behavior Therapy Full Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The DBT full intervention is based on Miller et al.'s DBT for suicidal youth, with modifications for youth with BD. Participants will receive the full 1-year DBT intervention (approx. 40 sessions) alternating between individual and skills training sessions. Family involvement in skills training will be strongly encouraged, however will be up to the participant to decide. Participants in Level 3 will complete diary cards tailored for this population, assessing daily mood, suicidality, sleep, and medication adherence. Participants will report use of specified DBT skills on the diary card, and individualized treatment goals will be incorporated into the diary card (e.g., alcohol use). In addition, Level 3 will include skills coaching by phone (via phone and/or text). These brief, structured calls and/or texts function to promote skills generalization by helping the participant and any participating family member(s) use skills to achieve goals and solve problems.</description>
