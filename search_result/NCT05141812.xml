  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur during non-contact&#xD;
      mechanisms.This suggests that an individual's movement technique is a significant factor in&#xD;
      the cause of the injury. Hence, ACL injuries are increasingly being framed as an error in&#xD;
      motor planning and execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehab following an ACL reconstruction (ACLR) commonly follows a pathway of: regaining ROM,&#xD;
      strength development, power development, running, return to training and then return to&#xD;
      competition. However, several studies utilising functional brain MRI and electroencephalogram&#xD;
      have demonstrated dysfunction within the somatosensory and visual systems in the ACLR&#xD;
      population even after the completion of rehabilitation. This has been suggested to indicate&#xD;
      that the ACLR population becomes reliant on their visual system during motor planning and&#xD;
      execution, potentially increasing the risk of reinjury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated in studies utilising functional brain MRI and EEG that following&#xD;
      ACLR, individuals have increased activation of the visual system during simple motor tasks as&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls. This is suggested to represent an increased reliance on the&#xD;
      visual system during motor planning and execution. Increased reliance on the visual system&#xD;
      may negatively affect an individual's ability to respond to sporting situations which are&#xD;
      often chaotic in nature, resulting in an inappropriate movement technique being employed.&#xD;
      This may then result in an increased risk of reinjury. However, no study to date has been&#xD;
      able to assess how visual reliance affects change of direction biomechanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit individuals who are 7 months post-ACLR and intend on returning to&#xD;
      multi-directional field sport. Individuals will complete a stepping down task (eyes open&#xD;
      versus eyes closed) to identify participants who are reliant on their visual system.&#xD;
      Participants will then complete a 90 deg change of direction task in a planned and then&#xD;
      unplanned condition. Those who are visually reliant will be compared to those who are aren't&#xD;
      with regards to their unplanned change of direction biomechanics and also the change in their&#xD;
      biomechanics from a planned to unplanned condition.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change of direction biomechanics- planned versus unplanned</measure>
    <time_frame>at 7 months post-ACLR</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will perform 90 degree cut within a 3D lab utilising using an eight-camera motion analysis system (200Hz: Bonita-B10, Vicon, UK) and integrated force plates (1000Hz BP400600, AMTI, USA). Timing gates (Smartspeed, Fusion Sport) will be used to time the change of direction and also provide the participant a visual stimulus as to which direction they need to cut to. The lights will be on during planned change of direction and 3 trials will be taken for each direction. During the unplanned change of direction, the target timing gates (right or left) will only switch on 2 metres prior to the participants approaching the force plates. 3 trials will be taken in the unplanned condition</description>

    <time_frame>at 7 months post-ACLR</time_frame>
    <description>sensory tablet (Senaptec, USA) with preloaded assessment tasks to across multiple visual processing domains including near far quickness task. The task requires the participants to correctly answer a task on a screen 3 metres away. Upon entry of the correct answer, a task appears on a device 70-100cm from the participant. The task will then continue to move between the 2 screens over a 30 second period, with the number of correct responses and time taken to input a response being calculated. The number of correct responses over 30 second test period is reported with a higher score indicating better function</description>

    <measure>Near far quickness reaction time to target (as part of visual processing software)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 7 months post-ACLR</time_frame>
    <description>sensory tablet (Senaptec, USA) with preloaded assessment tasks to across multiple visual processing domains including near far quickness task. The task requires the participants to correctly answer a task on a screen 3 metres away. Upon entry of the correct answer, a task appears on a device 70-100cm from the participant. The task will then continue to move between the 2 screens over a 30 second period, with the number of correct responses and time taken to input a response being calculated. Average response time is calculated for individual to input correct response for a far target and a near target. A lower value indicates quicker reaction time and hence better function.</description>

    <description>sensory tablet (Senaptec, USA) with preloaded assessment tasks to across multiple visual processing domains including multiple object tracking task. In the task, a set of circles are highlighted to the participant. The circles then spin around the screen in conjunction with other circles before coming to a stop. The participant is then tasked with correctly identifying the circles that were initially highlighted.The software provides a proportional and composite score. A higher score indicates better function</description>

In the task, the participant places both index fingers on the screen, a flashing red image indicates which finger needs to be removed from the screen. The participant is advised to remove their finger from the screen as quickly as possible. Reaction times are provided by the software for each side (dominant hand and non-dominant hand) and also as an average between the two sides. A lower time indicates better function</description>
