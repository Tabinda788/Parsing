  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implant placement is the solution of choice for replacing missing teeth in a fixed way.&#xD;
      However, dental practitioners and surgeons are reluctant to place implants in the population&#xD;
      of patients with special needs. They argue different arguments which involve various risk&#xD;
      factors. A systematic review shows that it is clear that there is a gap in knowledge about&#xD;
      implant placement in patients with special needs in order to argue the choices of prosthetic&#xD;
      rehabilitation or abstention based on a scientific evidence-based approach. There is a need&#xD;
      of studies with a large number of patients and implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Unit of Special Care Dentistry at the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand started to&#xD;
      place implants in 2007. This study should present the evaluation of the survival, success and&#xD;
      failure rate of implants placed under general anesthesia and of the prosthesis rehabilitation&#xD;
      that followed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with special needs face multi-level barriers to dental care. Their oral health is&#xD;
      worse than those of the general population. Delayed care in one of many reasons that lead to&#xD;
      advanced dental disease and a need of more dental treatments. So, patients with special needs&#xD;
      are at higher risk of early edentulism, especially since they also are at higher risk of&#xD;
      extraction perfomed rather than conservative care. As a result, in addition to social and&#xD;
      psychological impacts, this influences largely the oral functioning. Functional problems&#xD;
      (mastication, swallowing) appear or are aggravated. A high prevalence of tooth loss&#xD;
      exacerbates chewing and swallowing problems. This increases the risk of aspiration and&#xD;
      choking, which is a major risk to general health, with bronchopulmonary disease being the&#xD;
      leading cause of death in special needs patients. The maintenance of oral functions is&#xD;
      therefore essential. However the conventional therapies are not adapted to patients with&#xD;
      special needs. In particular, removable prostheses are very poorly tolerated by these&#xD;
      patients because of the discomfort and the limitation of autonomy. The maintenance is&#xD;
      complicated (higher prevalence of loss and repair). Many authors put forward the difficulty&#xD;
      or even the impossibility of making removable prostheses for patients with disorders, Down's&#xD;
      syndrome patients, patients with mental retardation or physical limitations and epileptic&#xD;
      patients who present a risk of aspiration or ingestion of the prosthesis during seizures. In&#xD;
      addition, the presence of associated xerostomia contraindicates the removable prosthesis and&#xD;
      indicates the fixed solution. Implant placement is the solution of choice for replacing&#xD;
      missing teeth in a fixed way. However, dental practitioners and surgeons are reluctant to&#xD;
      place implants in the population of patients with special needs. They argue different&#xD;
      arguments which involve various risk factors. A systematic review was performed to summarize&#xD;
      the literature available about implant survival rates in patients with special needs. Twelve&#xD;
      articles could have been included in a meta-analysis. A mean survival rate of 92% at 47,2&#xD;
      months on average, for an average of 23 patients and 81 implants per study was obtained. It&#xD;
      is clear that there is a gap in knowledge about implant placement in patients with special&#xD;
      needs in order to argue the choices of prosthetic rehabilitation or abstention based on a&#xD;
      scientific evidence-based approach. There is a need of more studies with a large number of&#xD;
      patients and implants.&#xD;
