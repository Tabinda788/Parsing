    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of bone marrow neoplasms. MDS mostly affect&#xD;
      elderly people. The drugs used to treat MDS are not always effective, and the only curative&#xD;
      treatment is stem cell transplant. Researchers want to see if a new drug can be used to treat&#xD;
      MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if BMS-986253 is a safe and effective treatment for MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults aged 18 and older with MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, medication review, and physical exam.&#xD;
      They will answer questions about how well they are able to take care of themselves. Their&#xD;
      temperature, blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate will be monitored. They will have&#xD;
      an electrocardiogram to see how well their heart is working. They will give blood and urine&#xD;
      samples. They may have a bone marrow biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to a specific group. They will receive either BMS-986253 alone&#xD;
      or in combination with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given in 28-day cycles. Participants will get BMS-986253 as an infusion on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Some participants also will take oral DNMTi on days 2-6 of each&#xD;
      cycle. They will receive treatment until their disease gets worse or they have bad side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study visits, some screening tests will be repeated. Some of the samples that are&#xD;
      collected will be used for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after treatment ends, participants will have a follow-up visit to see how they&#xD;
      are doing. After that, follow up will occur via phone every 3-6 months until the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH will cover the costs for some travel expenses.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal bone marrow neoplasms characterized&#xD;
      by ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenia, and high risk for transformation to acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDS is primarily a disease of the elderly, with about 80% of participants being older than&#xD;
      65-years of age; with 10,000 new diagnoses per year in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only curative treatment for participants with MDS is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) and only a small portion of participants are eligible. Depending on&#xD;
      risk stratification, the median survival of high- and low-risk MDS participants is 1.5 to 5.9&#xD;
      years, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) are the standard of care therapy for high-risk MDS.&#xD;
      However, less than half of participants respond to DNMTi, and even the best responses are&#xD;
      transient and non-curative. More effective and less toxic therapies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a proinflammatory chemokine from the CXC family and a potent&#xD;
      chemoattractant of granulocytes and related cells to the site of inflammation. IL-8 is&#xD;
      uniquely upregulated and found at high levels in both the peripheral blood and bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirates of MDS participants. In purified MDS/AML long-term/short term stem cells and&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells both IL-8 and the IL-8 receptor, CXCR2, are&#xD;
      overexpressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data showed that CXCR2 inhibition led to significantly reduce proliferation of&#xD;
      leukemic cell lines. In addition, MDS CD34+ cell cultures treated with neutralizing anti-IL-8&#xD;
      showed improvement in erythroid colony formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMS-986253 is a fully humanized IgG1 neutralizing antibody that showed a favorable safety&#xD;
      profile in participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatment with DNMTi and BMS-986253 may improve treatment responses in&#xD;
      participants with MDS by attenuating chemoattraction of myeloid derived suppressor cells to&#xD;
      the bone marrow, indirectly disinhibiting NK- and T-cell responses against MDS stem cells,&#xD;
      reducing neoangiogenesis, and improving cytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: To determine the optimal biological dose (OBD) and RP2D of BMS-986253 with or&#xD;
      without DNMTi (decitabine and cedazuridine) therapy in MDS participants, and to describe the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of BMS-986253.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To determine ORR to BMS-986253 with or without DNMTi (decitabine and cedazuridine)&#xD;
      therapy in MDS, measured according to the proposed revised IWG 2018 response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed MDS according to 2016 WHO&#xD;
      criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      And, for Phase I: received a minimum of 2 and maximum of 8 cycles of DNMTi&#xD;
&#xD;
      have higher-risk (HR) MDS (R-IPSS &gt;= 3.5) or&#xD;
&#xD;
      have lower risk (LR) MDS (R-IPSS &lt;3.5), at least one cytopenia and are either ineligible or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory to other standard of care therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      And, for Phase II: received a minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 cycles of DNMTi&#xD;
&#xD;
      have HR-MDS (R-IPSS &gt;= 3.5) or&#xD;
&#xD;
      have LR-MDS (R-IPSS &lt;3.5), at least one cytopenia and are either ineligible or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory to other standard of care therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;=18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status &lt;=2 (KPS &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: safety evaluation with determination of OBD of BMS-986253 with or without DNMTi&#xD;
      (decitabine and cedazuridine), and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: efficacy evaluation of BMS-986253 with or without DNMTi (decitabine and&#xD;
      cedazuridine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both Phase I and II, participants will be enrolled into two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Higher-risk cohort (HR-MDS), including high-risk and higher intermediate-risk disease,&#xD;
      defined as those with R-IPSS &gt;= 3.5: treatment with BMS-986253 in combination with DNMTi&#xD;
      (decitabine and cedazuridine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Lower-risk cohort (LR-MDS), including low-risk and lower intermediate-risk disease&#xD;
      participants, defined as those with R-IPSS &lt;3.5: treatment with BMS-986253 given as&#xD;
      monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase I, the safety endpoint will be DLT by D28 with the objective of defining the OBD&#xD;
      and RP2D for BMS-986253. In addition, follow up for safety will be assessed 30 days after the&#xD;
      end of the treatment cycle. For Phase II, the primary endpoint will be overall response rate&#xD;
      after 6 cycles, reported separately by cohort.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;=18 years&#xD;

             BMS-986253 as monotherapy or in combination with DNMTi in participants &lt;18 years of&#xD;
             age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric&#xD;
             trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;=2 (Karnofsky &gt;=60%).&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or women presently breast-feeding their children are excluded due to&#xD;
             unknown risks to a developing fetus or infant.&#xD;
