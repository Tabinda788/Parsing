  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a single-center randomized controlled trial at the Affiliated Drum Tower&#xD;
      Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School. There were patients who underwent clinical&#xD;
      follow-ups since 2018 in POF clinic. Patients were given treatment of either UCA-PSC or&#xD;
      WJ-MSC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At entry, all patients had already received a standard non-physiologic hormone replacement&#xD;
      regimen. According to blinded preferences for participation, patients were randomized into&#xD;
      two treatment groups after an initial 2-month washout period of no therapy. One group&#xD;
      received UCA-PSC transplantation plus horone replacement treatment (HRT) (UCA-PSC group),&#xD;
      while the other group received WJ-MSC transplantation plus HRT (collagen/WJ-MSC group)&#xD;

    <description>After vaginal sterilization, TVUS-guided transplantation was performed by the senior-level medical physician B Wang), using a SIEMENS ACUSON ANTANES premium edition system (SIEMENS AG Healthcae Sector, Erlangen, Germany), equipped with a 6-10 MHz probe. The solution (a total number of 2×10^7cells, 1×10^7 /400 μL for unilateral ovarian injection) was injected into the ovary by using 21G PTC needles (Hakko Medical Co, Japan) under TVUS guiance. Each patent received up to three transplantations.</description>
