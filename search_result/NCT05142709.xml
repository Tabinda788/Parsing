      This study is a multi-center, non-interventional study. Patients' background, treatment&#xD;
      pattern, treatment outcome, efficacy will be collected in metastatic esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (ESCC) patients who were treated with ICIs as 1st line treatment at approximately&#xD;
      26 institutions. The patients should have received at least 1 cycle of anti-PD-1&#xD;
      immunotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Based on these data, overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) from start of 1st line treatment and the role and efficacy of&#xD;
      radiotherapy for these patients will be assessed.&#xD;
