      This study determines patterns of cannabis use among cancer patients. Information collected&#xD;
      in this study may help doctors to understand patient use of cannabis therapy, their knowledge&#xD;
      and experiences with this therapy, benefits and risks associated with its use, and whether or&#xD;
      to what extent they are discussing it with their health care providers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the frequency, modes, and duration of cannabis use, assess experiences with&#xD;
      obtaining and using cannabis, as well as reasons for use and perceived risks and benefits of&#xD;
      its use among cancer patients who are undergoing or have recently completed active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To uncover disparities in use of cannabis, perceptions of use, and communication with&#xD;
      providers among cancer patients who are identify as racial and ethnic minorities, have low&#xD;
      health or digital literacy, are of older age or low socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Among cancer patients with a known medical marijuana certification, assess the impact of&#xD;
      cannabis on pain management, anxiety, anorexia, and quality of life, as well as their&#xD;
      communication with their oncology team about their procurement and use of cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a survey about knowledge and awareness of medical cannabis, perceived risks&#xD;
      and benefits of cannabis, mode and frequency of use (if applicable), impact on cancer-related&#xD;
      symptoms, patient provider discussions about cannabis, and demographic characteristics&#xD;
      including health and digital literacy.&#xD;
