  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that prolonged mechanically ventilated adults who participate in an&#xD;
      early mobilization and endurance exercise training protocol, have an improved pulmonary&#xD;
      outcome and functional capacity and more functionally independent at hospital discharge&#xD;
      compared to patients receiving the usual physiotherapy care. Further, the investigators&#xD;
      expect improvements in weaning rate from mechanical ventilator, less time on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, a shorter length of stay in the respiratory care center and the hospital, and a&#xD;
      higher quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge compared to patients receiving&#xD;
      usual care. The investigators will conduct a prospective, single-center, allocation concealed&#xD;
      and assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial with superiority design and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. The study is being conducted in the interdisciplinary respiratory care center of&#xD;
      Taichung Tzu Chi Hospital, Taiwan. To be eligible to participate in the study patients must&#xD;
      be aged 18 to 75, be expected to stay on mechanical ventilator for at least 21 days, which&#xD;
      reflects a prolonged stay at mechanical ventilator. Standard care (control group)&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the control group will receive usual physiotherapy and respiratory&#xD;
      care center standard care, which includes weaning protocols and bed exercise program based on&#xD;
      previous publications. In this procedure, physiotherapy and mobilization will start after&#xD;
      medical prescription. Treatments are based on the therapist's assessment and are accordingly&#xD;
      individually tailored. Sessions will usually take place once daily from Monday to Friday. The&#xD;
      participants randomised to the experimental group will receive a standardised exercise&#xD;
      program involving early mobilization and endurance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endurance training will be conducted with grading exercise level. In the course of&#xD;
      endurance training, The participants will be prompted verbally for at least 10 min. The aim&#xD;
      during all mobilizations will be to involve the participants as actively as possible to&#xD;
      promote independence.&#xD;

      The primary hypothesis is that prolonged mechanically ventilated adults who participate in an&#xD;
      early mobilization and endurance exercise training protocol, have an improved pulmonary&#xD;
      outcome and functional capacity and are, therefore, more functionally independent at hospital&#xD;
      discharge compared to patients receiving the usual physiotherapy care. Secondary hypotheses&#xD;
      are that this early training protocol is as feasible and as safe as standard therapy&#xD;
      protocol. Further, The investigators expect improvements in weaning rate from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator, less time on mechanical ventilation, a shorter length of stay in the respiratory&#xD;
      care center and the hospital, and a higher quality of life at 6 months after hospital&#xD;
      discharge compared to participants receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design The investigators will conduct a prospective, single-center, allocation&#xD;
      concealed and assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial with superiority design and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up. The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Taichung Tzu Chi&#xD;
      Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Taiwan. This trial is conducted according to&#xD;
      Taiwan law and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study is being conducted in the interdisciplinary respiratory care&#xD;
      center of Taichung Tzu Chi Hospital, Taiwan. To be eligible to participate in the study&#xD;
      patients must be aged 18 or older, be expected to stay on mechanical ventilator for at least&#xD;
      21 days, which reflects a prolonged stay at mechanical ventilator. The participants with&#xD;
      prior muscle weakness, such as a preexisting neurological or neuromuscular disease with&#xD;
      functional deficits or a prolonged bedridden for at least 2 months prior to the respiratory&#xD;
      care center admission, are excluded from the study. Further exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      contraindications to cycling (mainly fractures or recent surgical procedures to the lower&#xD;
      limbs, acute thrombosis, preexisting open wounds, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)&#xD;
      and body weight of more than 150 kg), patients who are already enrolled in another&#xD;
      intervention study, patients receiving palliative care, patients with a diagnosis on&#xD;
      admission that excludes the possibility of walking at hospital discharge (for example,&#xD;
      paraplegia) and lastly patients who do not understand either traditional Chinese and&#xD;
      Taiwanese language. Standard care (control group) Participants randomised to the control&#xD;
      group will receive usual physiotherapy and respiratory care center standard care, which&#xD;
      includes weaning protocols and bed exercise program based on previous publications. Current&#xD;
      physiotherapy practice consists of positioning, respiratory therapy, passive range of&#xD;
      movement exercises for nonresponsive participants or active exercises if arousable, and early&#xD;
      mobilization. In order to start as early as possible, physiotherapists screen participants&#xD;
      regularly focusing on prevention and treatment of functional and pulmonary impairment.&#xD;
      However, subject to the internal procedure, physiotherapy and mobilization will start after&#xD;
      medical prescription. Treatments are based on the therapist's assessment and are accordingly&#xD;
      individually tailored. Sessions will usually take place once daily from Monday to Friday and,&#xD;
      if deemed necessary (e.g. severe weakness, intensive rehabilitation and weaning period,&#xD;
      retained airway secretion or atelectasis in extubated participants), this includes treatment&#xD;
      at the weekend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention (experimental group) Participants randomised to the experimental group&#xD;
      will receive a standardised exercise program involving early mobilization and endurance&#xD;
      training. The clinician in charge will decide before study inclusion, whether there are any&#xD;
      contraindications to include the patient, and during the study, if at any time the treatment&#xD;
      should be stopped, e.g. in case of an adverse event (decreased SaO2). Therefore, the&#xD;
      intervention will be started as soon as it is deemed safe by the treating respiratory care&#xD;
      center team and will occur from Monday to Friday and, if deemed necessary, at the weekend.&#xD;
      Throughout all activities, progression will be increased successively, depending on an&#xD;
      individual's tolerance and stability. If needed, the physiotherapist will split the delivery&#xD;
      of the exercise program into one or more sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of treatments, its content and duration will be noted for both the control and&#xD;
      experimental group. The endurance training will be conducted with grading exercise level. In&#xD;
      the course of endurance training, patient's participation will be prompted verbally. After&#xD;
      achieving patient's active participation in sitting on the bed, the goal will be to train for&#xD;
      at least 20 min. If this is accomplished, exercise level and training period increased until&#xD;
      a maximum of 7 on modified RPE. Tolerance and stability will be judged by the responsible&#xD;
      physiotherapist according to patient's modified perceived level of exertion (modified RPE&#xD;
      Scale). If a participant is able to perform the exercises correctly, he will be given a&#xD;
      tutorial with pictures in order to train independently with nurses or family members. If&#xD;
      unable to perform the exercises, the physiotherapist will use tactile facilitation or passive&#xD;
      range of movement for all joints and their possible directions. If the previous exercises are&#xD;
      well-tolerated, bed mobility and sitting upright in bed will be started. If these are&#xD;
      well-tolerated and no contraindications as per medical prescription exist, the treatment will&#xD;
      be further advanced to mobilizing participants to the bedside. There, balance exercises will&#xD;
      be performed or, if needed, support will be provided by the physiotherapist or various&#xD;
      assistive equipment. After being able to sit for at least 10 min on the side of the bed,&#xD;
      regardless of whether support is needed, participants will be moved into a chair with an&#xD;
      individually adapted transfer according to the individual's resources. The aim during all&#xD;
      mobilizations will be to involve the patient as actively as possible to promote independence.&#xD;
      While sitting, functional tasks and activities of daily living will be performed and&#xD;
      gradually increased to standing and walking exercises.&#xD;
