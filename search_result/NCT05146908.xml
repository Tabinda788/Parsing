      In intensive care, gastrointestinal dysfunction may occur in response to systemic insult.&#xD;
      Acute gastrointestinal dysfunction (AGID) has been clinically defined by consensus and&#xD;
      several grades of severity have been defined. Biomarkers of digestive distress have also been&#xD;
      described in intensive care and can be measured directly in the plasma (lipopolysaccharide,&#xD;
      intestinal fatty acid binding protein, citrulline, glucagon-like peptide-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral nutrition is a frequent therapy in intensive care patients, and its administration is&#xD;
      recommended. In general, nurtition is resumed early via a nasogastric tube in patients placed&#xD;
      on mechanical ventilation. The resumption of nutrition can be seen as a &quot;challenge&quot; to the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, and may thus unmask underlying gastrointestinal dysfunction.&#xD;
      Intolerance of enteral nutrition is a symptom of gastrointestinal dysfunction and is&#xD;
      associated with poor clinical outcomes. Indeed, it is both a marker of severity by reflecting&#xD;
      organ dysfunction and responsible for a reduction in caloric intake that can influence&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus on the definition of intolerance to enteral nutrition. In practice, it&#xD;
      is most often recognized because of regurgitation or vomiting, requiring reduction or&#xD;
      discontinuation. In a recent review, the authors emphasize the need for digestive monitoring&#xD;
      for early diagnosis of nutritional intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric echography is a minimally invasive and reliable means of monitoring the gastric&#xD;
      contents. In particular, the surface of the antrum has been validated as a way to diagnose a&#xD;
      full stomach in intensive care. The measurement of echographic variations in gastric residue&#xD;
      with the resumption of enteral nutrition could thus allow the early diagnosis of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction and food intolerance by preceding vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to show the interest of echographic monitoring of the stomach during the&#xD;
      resumption of enteral feeding for the diagnosis of nutritional intolerance. As nutritional&#xD;
      intolerance is a symptom of gastrointestinal dysfunction, we will also study this phenomenon&#xD;
      by measuring the associations between echographic data, clinical data and biomarkers of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction.&#xD;
