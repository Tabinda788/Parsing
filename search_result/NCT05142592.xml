  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, Multi-center, Non-randomized, Open-label, Dose-escalation, and Dose&#xD;
      Expansion Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary&#xD;
      Anti-tumor Activity of IPG7236 Administered Orally as a Single Agent in Patients with&#xD;
      Advanced Solid Tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part 1) and a dose expansion phase (Part 2).&#xD;
      Each part will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period, an end of&#xD;
      treatment visit and a safety follow-up of approximately 30 days after the last dose. IPG7236&#xD;
      will be given on an empty stomach (either one hour before or two hours after a meal) twice&#xD;
      daily (approximately every 12 hours) in continuous 28-day cycles.&#xD;
