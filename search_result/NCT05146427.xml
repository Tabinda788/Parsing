    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot project proposal is to test the hypothesis that decreased sleep&#xD;
      slow-wave activity (SWA) observed in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) is&#xD;
      related to mood dysfunction, and that manipulating SWA may serve to improve mood by&#xD;
      normalizing SWA regulation. The investigators propose to enhance SWA during nighttime sleep&#xD;
      in a group of 20 antidepressant-free males and females age 25-50 with varying degrees of&#xD;
      impairment in mood. Each participant will undergo one baseline night of sleep in the&#xD;
      laboratory and then will sleep with the SmartSleep Headband nightly for two weeks in their&#xD;
      own home. For one week, slow-wave sleep will be enhanced. On the alternate week, sleep will&#xD;
      not be changed. Following the two weeks of sleeping with the device, participants will then&#xD;
      spend another night in the sleep laboratory to assess changes in sleep. Mood will be assessed&#xD;
      by self-report and clinician-administered scales following the baseline night of sleep,&#xD;
      virtually after the first experimental week, and at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
