  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meta-analyses have demonstrated that mindfulness-based programmes are more effective than no&#xD;
      treatment across different populations and desired outcomes yet there is limited evidence on&#xD;
      how to sustain these benefits beyond the traditional eight-week courses. The 'Taking it&#xD;
      Further' (TiF) programme was developed by the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre to help&#xD;
      reinforce and deepen one's mindfulness practice to promote well-being and mental health for&#xD;
      life. The proposed study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this programme in graduates of&#xD;
      MBCT/MBSR on well-being and mental health outcomes and explore the mediators (i.e.&#xD;
      mindfulness, decentring, and self-compassion) through which this programme has an effect over&#xD;
      the course of twelve weeks using a randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control. The&#xD;
      planned research is part of an overall effort to optimize treatment effects and the long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness of mindfulness-based programmes.&#xD;

      Participants that expressed an interest in taking part in the study were screened for&#xD;
      research inclusion/exclusion criteria and for course suitability. Research&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion was assessed by the lead researcher whereas course suitability was&#xD;
      assessed jointly by the lead researcher and a trained mindfulness teacher at the Oxford&#xD;
      Mindfulness Centre (OMC). Eligible participants were invited to complete baseline measures&#xD;
      that assessed the primary outcome and mediator (well-being and mindfulness respectively)&#xD;
      around one month before the start date and then again around two weeks before the start date&#xD;
      to establish a stable baseline. For one of these online questionnaires, participants were&#xD;
      instructed to complete an online orientation video to ensure continued eligibility. Within&#xD;
      one week of the start date, participants were randomized to the treatment (online TiF&#xD;
      programme) or wait-list control group. One day before the start date, all participants were&#xD;
      invited to complete a battery of questionnaires which assessed the outcome measures&#xD;
      (well-being, psychological quality of life, depression, anxiety), mediator measures&#xD;
      (mindfulness, self-compassion, decentring), and an additional measure regarding perceived&#xD;
      expectations about the mindfulness course. Participants were then invited to complete a&#xD;
      battery of questionnaires at weeks 4, 8, and 12 (post-intervention). For the battery of&#xD;
      questionnaires for weeks 4 and 8, participants completed the same measures assessed at&#xD;
      baseline with additional questions that assessed: the amount of practice, quality of&#xD;
      practice, side effects of practice, and overall experience. For week 12 (post-intervention),&#xD;
      participants completed the same measures as weeks 4 and 8 with additional questions that&#xD;
      assessed the perceived credibility of the mindfulness programme, perceived quality of&#xD;
      mindfulness teaching, and potential harm. Data collection was divided into two phases, with&#xD;
      the first phase running from June-September and the second phase running from&#xD;
      October-December 2021. The TiF courses were run online and the surveys themselves were also&#xD;
      administered online.&#xD;

    <description>This programme is offered to individuals who have already completed a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Programme (MBSR). In this programme, participants explore weekly themes (i.e. 'Responding not reacting' and 'Taking care of ourselves, taking care of others'). These themes reinforce the learning from the eight-week MBCT/MBSR courses whilst also providing new learning opportunities. The programme makes some of the dimensions that are implicit in MBCT/MBSR more explicit; for example, the cultivation of attitudes of mindfulness (such as equanimity, joy, and kindness). These attitudes of mindfulness require a foundational mindfulness practice and thus this is an additive learning theme from traditional MBCT/MBSR programmes.</description>
