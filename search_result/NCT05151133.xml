    <textblock>
      The investigators is now carrying out a clinical study of Umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem&#xD;
      Cells (UCMSCs) in the treatment of Allergic rhinitis (AR). UCMSCs is known to its&#xD;
      multilineage differentiation potential, strong proliferation ability, low immunogenicity,&#xD;
      convenient material acquisition, and fewer restrictions on ethical and moral issues. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to find a novel, minimally invasive, effective and simple treatment for&#xD;
      the large number of patients with persistent moderate to severe AR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR), is a noninfectious inflammatory disease of nasal mucosa mediated by&#xD;
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody and involved in a variety of immune active cells and&#xD;
      cytokines after the atopic body is exposed to allergens. The incidence of allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      increases as people's living standards improves. It is estimated that about 1.4 billion&#xD;
      people worldwide have been affected by the disease. Some patients with moderate to severe AR&#xD;
      have no improvement in symptoms after drug treatment, which continues to affect daily life&#xD;
      and work. Therefore, these patients urgently needs a new, minimally invasive, effective and&#xD;
      simple treatment. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the&#xD;
      mesoderm, which can differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat and other cells. MSCs can also&#xD;
      secrete a variety of bioactive molecules, which have the effects of regulating immunity and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory. Based on its immunomodulatory effect, MSCs is gradually becoming a new&#xD;
      star in the treatment of allergic diseases. In pre-clinical studies on the treatment of AR,&#xD;
      MSCs have shown good therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, open, single-center clinical study. Participants were recruited&#xD;
      into three different dose groups. The cohort size of each dose group was 6 participants. The&#xD;
      subjects of each group each will receive one course of treatment with a single injection.&#xD;
      Subjects of group 1 will receive 0.5×10^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs;&#xD;
      group 2 will receive 1.0×10^6 cells/kg; with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs; group 3 will&#xD;
      receive 2.0×10^6 cells/kg, with a total volume of 100 ml UCMSCs. One month after each&#xD;
      injection, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will comprehensively evaluate the&#xD;
      results of the phased clinical research, and after determining the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      the research, the enrollment of the next phase will start. The subjects will be followed up&#xD;
      on the 3rd day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the&#xD;
      treatment. The main outcome measures are the severity and incidence of adverse events. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures are RQLQ score, VAS score, serum inflammatory factor detection,&#xD;
      nasal secretion inflammatory factor detection, nasal function test and nasal endoscopy, etc.&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will also monitor safety indicators such as blood routine,&#xD;
      urine routine, liver and kidney function, immunological indicators, tumor markers, etc. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, according to the data obtained, the clinical safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of UCMSCs in the treatment of moderate to severe persistent AR will be&#xD;
      evaluated, so as to provide drug dose basis for the next stage of clinical research.&#xD;
