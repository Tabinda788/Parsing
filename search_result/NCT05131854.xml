  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk factors for cardiac arrest during spine surgery have been well defined, including lumbar&#xD;
      fusion, age over 65 years, obesity, cardiovascular disease, ethnicity and ASA status.&#xD;
      Bradycardia and asystole have been described under general anaesthesia in combined surgical&#xD;
      cohorts: Proposed mechanisms include unopposed parasympathetic activation, enhanced vasovagal&#xD;
      response to decreased venous return, and psychiatric stressors. The investigators&#xD;
      prospectively will review patients candidates for spine surgery to explore potential&#xD;
      incidence, contributory factors and outcomes to unexpected transient intraoperative&#xD;
      haemodynamic instability, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest during spine surgery as these data&#xD;
      are needed to aid risk stratification and improve decision making for spine care teams.&#xD;
