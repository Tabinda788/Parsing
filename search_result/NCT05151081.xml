      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot of etiological factors related to overactive bladder (OAB) has been investigated.&#xD;
      However, the role of primary nocturnal enuresis (NE), which is characterized with childhood&#xD;
      night time incontinence, in the etiology of OAB is controversial. This study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of NE in patients diagnosed with OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metod Between january-september 2021, the data of patients who applied to the urology&#xD;
      outpatientclinic with OAB symptoms were collected. Patients with a history of chronic&#xD;
      systemic disease, previous medical treatment for OAB and who did not accept to join the study&#xD;
      were excluded. According to the diagnosis of childhood NE, patients were divided into two&#xD;
      groups. Demographic data hav been recorded. Frequency of incontinence, number of day time&#xD;
      void and nocturia were evaluated according to a 3 day voiding diary. Inaddition, max. Urinary&#xD;
      flowr atio (Qmax), bladder Wall thickness and postvoid residual vol√ºme rates were determined&#xD;
      using uroflowmetry and pelvic ultrasound.&#xD;

Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) questionnaire were used for the assessment of OAB. OABSS is an questionnaire ,consisting of 4 questions, was prepared by Homma et al. in 2006</description>
