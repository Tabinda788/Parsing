    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant nivolumab for&#xD;
      non-metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), and explore the potential predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers of immunotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a malignant tumor originated from the&#xD;
      epithelium of upper urinary tract (renal pelvis and ureter). The standard treatment of UTUC&#xD;
      is radical nephroureterectomy with ipsilateral bladder cuff excision. For locally advanced&#xD;
      disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy with radiotherapy is also a&#xD;
      considerable treatment. In general, patients with UTUC are often diagnosed in a late stage&#xD;
      with a poor survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) emerged huge success in treatment of various type&#xD;
      of cancers, including metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Several anti-PD1 or PD-L1 agents&#xD;
      demonstrated an exciting response for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The encouraging&#xD;
      success makes clinical trials moving forward to neoadjuvant setting. In the PURE-01 study,&#xD;
      patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer received 3 cycles of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab&#xD;
      achieving 39.5% pathological complete response (pCR). It brought a brand-new hope for&#xD;
      organ-preservation treatment strategy. So far, neoadjuvant ICI has not been tested in&#xD;
      patients with UTUC, irrespective for treatment efficacy or safety analysis. More importantly,&#xD;
      there is still lack of reliable biomarkers to predict treatment response of ICI, which&#xD;
      definitely an unmet medical need in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators proposed a phase II, open-label study of neoadjuvant nivolumab&#xD;
      in locally advanced UTUC. Investigators believe that neoadjuvant nivolumab will achieve at&#xD;
      least similar pCR rate compared with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in UCB patients. Furthermore,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a comprehensive exploratory genomic analysis to identify the&#xD;
      potential candidate biomarkers to predict the response of nivolumab.&#xD;

    <description>If you meet all the conditions to participate in the trial, you will receive the following treatments: Your physician will give you 360 mg of Nivolumab as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for about 30 minutes. For safety reasons, we recommend that you stay in the hospital for 60 minutes after the initial infusion of nivolumab. There will be a total of 3 cycles of Nivolumab treatments during the study period. You will need to return every 3 weeks. Each return will collect about 50 ml (10 tsp) of blood samples, depending on local standards.</description>
