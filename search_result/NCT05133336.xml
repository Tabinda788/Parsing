               4. Stroke or transient ischemic attack in the 24 weeks before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of intracranial hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, bleeding disorder,&#xD;
             coagulation disorders, or screening blood tests that, in the opinion of the&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. An uncontrolled thyroid disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism: defined as any history of hyperthyroidism that has&#xD;
                  either not been treated with either radioactive iodine and/or surgery or that has&#xD;
                  been treated with radioactive iodine and/or surgery, but has required ongoing&#xD;
                  continuous or intermittent use of thyroid hormone synthesis inhibitors (i.e.,&#xD;
                  methimazole or propylthiouracil) in the 24 weeks before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism: defined as initiation of thyroid hormone replacement&#xD;
                  therapy or dose adjustment of replacement therapy in the 12 weeks before&#xD;
                  screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of myopathies or evidence of active muscle disease demonstrated by CPK ≥ 5 x&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Subjects whose ALT, AST, or ALP exceeds by more than 50% on Visit 2 reading compared&#xD;
             to Visit 1. Note: If the ALT, AST, or ALP values on Visit 2 exceed by more than 50%&#xD;
             from Visit 1, then a third value will be measured (within 1- 2 weeks) to assess for&#xD;
             the trend. If the third value shows continued increase ≥ 10%, then subject is&#xD;
             considered ineligible for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any of the following laboratory values at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Platelets &lt; 100 × 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Albumin &lt; 3.2 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. ALP &gt; 10 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. ALT or AST &gt; 250 U/L&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Participation in another interventional clinical study and receipt of any other&#xD;
             investigational medication (within 12 weeks prior to randomization up to end of&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of malignancy in the past 5 years and/or active neoplasm with the exception of&#xD;
             resolved superficial non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Contraindications to Saroglitazar Magnesium or has any conditions affecting the&#xD;
             ability to evaluate the effects of Saroglitazar Magnesium.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Known allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance to the study drug, comparator, or&#xD;
             formulation ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Pregnancy-related exclusions, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pregnant/lactating female (including positive pregnancy test at screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Fertile women and men, UNLESS using effective contraceptive methods (such as an&#xD;
                  intra-uterine device or other mechanical contraception method with condom or&#xD;
                  diaphragm and spermicide) throughout the study. For male subjects, contraception&#xD;
                  measures (condom and spermicide) must be taken during the study, either by the&#xD;
                  male participant or his female partner. (Note: Enrolled females otherwise must be&#xD;
                  surgically sterilized for at least 24 weeks before screening or postmenopausal,&#xD;
                  defined as 52 weeks with no menses without an alternative medical cause or&#xD;
                  following sexual abstinence.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. History or other evidence of severe illness or any other conditions that would make&#xD;
             the subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study (such as&#xD;
             poorly controlled psychiatric disease, HIV, coronary artery disease, or active&#xD;
             gastrointestinal conditions that might interfere with drug absorption).&#xD;
