  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural killer cells (NK cells) are derived from bone marrow lymphoid stem cells, which are a&#xD;
      type of lymphocytes that can non-specifically kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells&#xD;
      without pre-sensitization. NK cells can not only directly kill malignant diseased cells, but&#xD;
      also participate in the regulation of immune cell response and play a role in a variety of&#xD;
      tumor immunotherapy strategies. The 2-year survival rate of NK cells combined with stem cell&#xD;
      therapy for patients with hematological malignancies reached 36%, which is significantly&#xD;
      higher than the 2-year survival rate (about 15%) of stem cell therapy alone, which can extend&#xD;
      the disease-free survival period of leukemia patients by an average of 1.5 years. Relapsed&#xD;
      and refractory leukemia can achieve a complete remission rate of up to 40%.&#xD;

      Natural killer cells (NK cells) are derived from bone marrow lymphoid stem cells, which are a&#xD;

      the disease-free survival period of leukemia patients by an average of 1.5 years. Relapsed&#xD;
      and refractory leukemia can achieve a complete remission rate of up to 40%. However, NK cell&#xD;
      therapy alone or the use of autologous NK cells to treat solid tumors is not effective. In&#xD;
      clinical trials related to rectal cancer, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, and gastric&#xD;
      cancer, the clinical response of NK cell adoptive therapy is not good. A phase II clinical&#xD;
      study found that the disease control rate of patients with ovarian cancer and breast cancer&#xD;
      after radiotherapy and chemotherapy can reach about 60% by NK cell infusion. The main reason&#xD;
      for the low treatment efficiency of solid tumors is related to the immunosuppressive effect&#xD;
      of the tumor microenvironment. Combination therapy is a potential breakthrough. Researches&#xD;
      targeting tumor immune microenvironment, targeting tumor cells and combined with NK cell&#xD;
      therapy have shown tumor therapeutic potential. NK cells combined with IgG1 antibody&#xD;
      treatment of gastric cancer and colon cancer in about 50% of patients with partial remission,&#xD;
      and 17% of patients are in stable condition. In summary, the combined application of the&#xD;
      demethylation drug DAC and NK cell infusion may be a new clinical strategy for the treatment&#xD;
      of malignant tumors.&#xD;
