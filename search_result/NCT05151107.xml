      BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the actual size and area of&#xD;
      the remnant stomach, as measured by Upper gastrointestinal tract radiography, on weight loss&#xD;
      after LSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2017 to December 2019, 56 patients with morbid obesity were&#xD;
      admitted to the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Foggia and&#xD;
      underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UGI tract radiography was performed on day two after the operation to rule out leakage.&#xD;

      Study design and setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      From May 2017 to December 2019, 56 patients with morbid obesity were admitted to the&#xD;
      Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Foggia and underwent laparoscopic&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy. UGI tract radiography with water-soluble contrast medium was performed on&#xD;
      the second day after the operation to rule out leakage. The radiographic images were&#xD;
      collected through a software program called &quot;PACS&quot; which combined with a viewer for image&#xD;
      processing, allows for the calculation of the residual stomach area (RSA). RSA was correlated&#xD;
      with postoperative weight (EWL) at 1, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients of both genders with morbid obesity defined as BMI&gt;40 kg/m2 or BMI&gt;35 kg/m2&#xD;
      with at least one associated major comorbidity were included. We excluded patients with&#xD;
      secondary obesity due to endocrine and psychological disorders, patients with previous&#xD;
      bariatric procedures and patients unwilling to comply with postoperative diet and exercise&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) and they were analyzed&#xD;
      using Student's T test. The correlation between gastric volume before and after LSG and BMI&#xD;
      and weight loss was measured using Pearson correlation coefficient test. Correlation&#xD;
      coefficients were classified as strong (-1.0 to -0.5 or 0.5 to 1.0), moderate (-0.5 to -0.3&#xD;
      or 0.3 to 0.5), and weak (-0.3 to -0.1 or 0.1 to 0.3). P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. This work is fully compliant with the STROCSS criteria&#xD;
