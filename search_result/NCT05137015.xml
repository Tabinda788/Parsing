  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Football is the most popular sport in the world, with 260 million male and female active&#xD;
      participants, including ~113,000 FIFA registered professional players. Playing football is&#xD;
      fun and can provide many health benefits, however, it also presents a high injury risk.&#xD;
      Studies on elite and non-elite footballers have reported similar injury rates in both&#xD;
      genders. The most common football-related injuries are the knee and ankle ligament and thigh&#xD;
      muscle strains, Over the past two decades, significant advancement has been made in the field&#xD;
      of injury prevention in football. There are used trials to prevent specific injuries, as&#xD;
      ankle sprain, ACL injuries, hamstring strains, etc. On the other hand, there are created&#xD;
      programs designed to prevent a wider spectrum of injuries like FIFA11+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a new injury prevention&#xD;
      program on the overall injury incidence in young football players.&#xD;
