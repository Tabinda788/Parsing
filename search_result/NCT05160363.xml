  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a clinical trial involving two medicines called piperaquine (PQP) and&#xD;
      pyronaridine (PYR) which, in combination with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and with artesunate&#xD;
      (ART) respectively, have been in clinical use for over 20 years to treat acute episodes of&#xD;
      malaria. PYR and PQP are both known to be well tolerated and provide effective treatment for&#xD;
      malarial infection when administered in their licensed combinations, but have not been&#xD;
      administered together in combination before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new combination is being considered for development for malaria prevention (i.e.&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis) in sub-Saharan Africa and therefore, the trial participants will be&#xD;
      exclusively drawn from a population from that origin.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2019, an estimated 229 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide, with approximately 94&#xD;
      % occurring in WHO African Region, leading to 409 000 deaths, of which about two thirds were&#xD;
      in children under five years of age. In addition, there were an estimated 33 million&#xD;
      pregnancies in the moderate to high transmission countries of the WHO African Region, of&#xD;
      which 35 % (12 million) were exposed to malaria infection during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case management with highly effective antimalarial drugs has contributed to the decrease in&#xD;
      malaria morbidity and mortality. However, preventive administration of antimalarial drugs is&#xD;
      also recommended for use in selected high-risk populations, irrespective of malaria infection&#xD;
      status, both to treat any unrecognized Plasmodium infections and to prevent new ones. These&#xD;
      preventive treatments prevent or cure undetected malarial illness with the goal to achieve&#xD;
      therapeutic drug levels in the blood throughout the period of greatest risk (WHO 2021). WHO&#xD;
      strongly recommends with a high-certainty evidence the following malaria chemopreventive&#xD;
      therapies: seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment in&#xD;
      infants (IPTi), and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the strong public health evidence of chemoprevention, only Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine&#xD;
      (SP) and Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SPAQ) are currently recommended by WHO&#xD;
      for chemoprevention, which use is currently threatened by increasing resistance to SP. The&#xD;
      strategy of the study sponsor, Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) is to re-combine existing&#xD;
      and approved antimalarials used individually for the treatment of malaria, for the purpose of&#xD;
      malaria chemoprevention. As part of this strategy, a review of the potential efficacy and&#xD;
      duration of protection, the safety and tolerability, as well as the risk of emergence of&#xD;
      resistance of currently approved products has been conducted, with a view to identify a new&#xD;
      combination of two registered products that may be suitable for malaria chemoprevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination of pyronaridine tetraphosphate (PYR) and piperaquine tetraphosphate (PQP) was&#xD;
      considered to have potential for this purpose. In the European Union, PQP is marketed in a&#xD;
      fixed dose combination with the short acting antimalarial dihydroartemisinin (DHA) as&#xD;
      Eurartesim® for treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria. PYR in a fixed dose combination&#xD;
      with artesunate (AS) received positive scientific opinion from EMA through Article 58 and is&#xD;
      marketed in South Korea and in many malaria endemic countries in Africa and South-East Asia&#xD;
      as Pyramax® for treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria. The efficacy of both PYR and PQP&#xD;
      combined to the artemisinin derivatives have been demonstrated in the treatment of&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria in various clinical trials in different regions and these combinations&#xD;
      have been in clinical use for at least 20 and 40 years, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study in healthy adults will be the first one to evaluate combined administration of&#xD;
      pyronaridine tetraphosphate (PYR) and piperaquine tetraphosphate (PQP) in humans. A parallel&#xD;
      group design (n=40) including a placebo cohort will be used to evaluate safety/tolerability&#xD;
      and PK of the two treatments either as monotherapy or in combination. To our knowledge, this&#xD;
      study will be the first human study with this new combination. The approved adult malaria&#xD;
      treatment doses of PQP and PYR have been chosen for this trial and four treatment arms that&#xD;
      include the use of matched placebos will facilitate discrimination of the contribution of the&#xD;
      treatments to any safety/tolerability signal and determine the pharmacokinetic of PYR and PQP&#xD;
      when administered alone and in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the ultimate target population, the study will be carried out in healthy black&#xD;
      participants of sub-Saharan African origin (defined as participants whose biological parents&#xD;
      are both black and are of sub-Saharan African origin).&#xD;

&#xD;
         35. Prior screen failure (where the cause of the screen failure is not deemed to be&#xD;
             temporary), randomisation, participation, or enrolment in this trial. Participants who&#xD;
             initially failed due to temporary non-medically significant issues are eligible for&#xD;
             re-screening once the cause has resolved&#xD;
&#xD;
