      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary teeth play an important role in the development and growth of a child. Although their&#xD;
      role in esthetics, speech, eating, and to encourage normal function. The other main function&#xD;
      of a primary tooth is to hold space for the permanent successor until it's time for eruption.&#xD;
      This normal physiologic process can be affected due to early premature loss of primary&#xD;
      molars, due to dental caries which may lead to mesial tipping or migration of large permanent&#xD;
      molar teeth into the space created. This may result in loss of space leading to discrepancy&#xD;
      of arch length, malocclusion, crowding of teeth, cross bite, impaction of permanent&#xD;
      premolars, and supra-eruption of opposing tooth. The best approach to maintain arch space and&#xD;
      to prevent malocclusion is to use a space maintainer. Band and loop has been used since long&#xD;
      as a space maintainer with high success rates. But there are some disadvantages can be&#xD;
      associated with space maintainers which include, loss of cement, solder failure, caries&#xD;
      formation along the margins of the band, long construction time, and the possibility of metal&#xD;
      allergy in some patients. These shortcomings in addition to the rising interest of esthetic&#xD;
      dentistry augmented by advances in technology have led to the development of newer materials&#xD;
      and designs in the fabrication of space maintainers such as fiber-reinforced composite resins&#xD;
      (FRCR) as fixed space maintainers. Digital technologies such as CAD CAM technology and new&#xD;
      materials are becoming popular, getting better and changing the way to therapy. The ceramic&#xD;
      space maintainer seems to be a suitable alternative to the conventional band and loop space&#xD;
      maintainer. The appliance is well tolerated by the patient and also gives the benefit of&#xD;
      advanced aesthetics with improved strength and allowing the easiest way of debonding during&#xD;
      eruption of permanent successors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Primary Objective Evaluate and compare CAD/CAM zircon space maintainer and conventional&#xD;
      metal of band and loop space maintainers in terms of plaque deposits (Plaque index), gingival&#xD;
      health (Gingival index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success rate of appliances in terms of survival time, cement loss and appliance breakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Secondary Objectives Compare both appliances in terms of patient satisfaction. Evaluate&#xD;
      the shear bond strength of three different cements used for CAD CAM zircon space maintainer&#xD;
      cementation in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Follow up and outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recalled for clinical follow up after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. 2- In vitro&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different cements, namely, self-adhesive resin cement, resin-modified glass ionomer&#xD;
      cement, and universal bioactive cement, will be used in this study. All of the materials will&#xD;
      be applied according to the manufacturers' instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grouping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The zirconia specimen divided randomly into three groups according to type of cements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Self-adhesive resin cement Group B: Resin-modified glass ionomer cement Group C:&#xD;
      Universal bioactive cement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen collection and Preparation for shear bond strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freshly extracted human molars, caries free will be collected and examined by&#xD;
      stereomicroscope to exclude any specimen with cracks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The roots of each tooth will be removed, the teeth will be cleaned and polished with&#xD;
      non-fluoridated flour of pumice for 10s using rubber cup, and then rinsed with stream of&#xD;
      water and then drying it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teeth will be mounted in a self-cure acrylic resin so that the crown will be exposed, the&#xD;
      acrylic blocks will be number coded with a different number for each group of samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of zirconia specimens Zirconia specimens will be milled from yttrium-stabilized&#xD;
      tetragonal zirconia (Y-TZP). The bonding site of each specimen will be finished using 600-,&#xD;
      800-, 1000- and 1200-grit silicon carbide paper to obtain a flat surface. All the zirconia&#xD;
      specimen will be ultrasonically cleaned in deionized water for 5 min and divided into three&#xD;
      groups according to the types of cements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cementation protocol The zirconia specimens will be divided into three groups according to&#xD;
      type of cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The zirconia specimens will be bonded to the enamel specimen of the extracted teeth by cement&#xD;
      prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Excess cement was removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens will be held in a fixed position without any movement for 5 min to achieve&#xD;
      self-curing without motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shear Bond Strength testing After the cementation procedure, all specimens will be stored at&#xD;
      37°C in distilled water for 24 h. Then, the specimens will be subjected to Shear Bond&#xD;
      Strength testing by applying a shear load to the zirconia until bond failure occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following deboning, the specimen will be examined under a stereomicroscope to determine the&#xD;
      mode of bond failures (adhesive, cohesive, or mixed).&#xD;
