      In the present study, we propose a mixed methods approach to characterize and address the&#xD;
      sexual health needs among women with breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and throughout&#xD;
      treatment. The objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the sexual well-being of women longitudinally throughout the continuum&#xD;
           of care, from initial diagnosis into survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We predict that treatment will adversely affect sexual well-being, and that patient&#xD;
           factors, clinical factors, and treatment choices will influence changes in sexual&#xD;
           well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify gaps is sexual health education provided at the time of diagnosis or during&#xD;
           treatment and to determine the appropriate timing of sexual health education delivery.&#xD;

    <description>Providers with extensive training and expertise in the subject will lead the virtual focus groups over Zoom using a semi-structured guide. Topics will focus on education received from the health care team, information received from outside sources, and patient recommendations on the type and timing of information preferred.&#xD;
We will create an analytic report based on the focus group findings, which will be used to inform the development of educational material.&#xD;
Sexual well-being is currently measured longitudinally on a 0-100 point scale as a component of a validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) survey (BREAST-Q) distributed to all breast cancer patients. These scores will be analyzed in patients with and without educational interventions for comparison.</description>
