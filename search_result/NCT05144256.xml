  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACTIVATE-KidsT (AG348-C-022) is a multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of treatment with mitapivat compared with placebo in pediatric participants with&#xD;
      pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) who are regularly receiving blood transfusions.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive either mitapivat or matching placebo.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by age (1 to &lt; 6 years, 6 to &lt; 12 years, 12 to &lt; 18 years)&#xD;
      and splenectomy status. Participants will be dosed by age and weight during a double-blind&#xD;
      period consisting of an 8-week dose titration period followed by a 24-week fixed-dose period.&#xD;
      Participants who complete the double-blind period will be eligible to receive mitapivat for&#xD;
      up to 5 years in the open-label extension (OLE) period.&#xD;
