      Protocol Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: A Phase I study of ExoFlo, an ex vivo culture-expanded adult allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicle isolate product, for the treatment of&#xD;
      medically refractory Crohn's disease Short Title: ExoFlo for Crohn's Disease Phase: 1&#xD;
      Methodology: Open label Study Duration: 24 months Subject Participation: 70 weeks Single or&#xD;
      Multi-Site: Single site Primary Objectives: • To evaluate the feasibility of intravenous&#xD;
      ExoFlo in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have failed or are&#xD;
      intolerant to one or more monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the safety of intravenous ExoFlo in subjects with moderately to severely active&#xD;
      Crohn's disease who have failed or are intolerant to one or more monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: • To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous ExoFlo in inducing clinical&#xD;
      remission in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have failed or&#xD;
      are intolerant to one or more monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous ExoFlo in inducing clinical response in subjects&#xD;
           with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have failed or are intolerant to&#xD;
           one or more monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous ExoFlo in improving disease-specific&#xD;
           health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ExoFlo therapy, including&#xD;
           changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and other&#xD;
           pharmacodynamic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must have colitis, ileitis, or ileocolitis&#xD;
      previously confirmed at any time in the past by radiography, histology, and/or endoscopy, and&#xD;
      must allow a 8-week washout for prior TNF antagonist use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen: Arm 1: IV administration of study agent at Day 0, Day 2,&#xD;
      Day 4, Week 2, Week 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter to week 46 (n=5), (total # doses = 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: IV administration of study agent at Day 0, Day 2, Day 4, Week 2, Week 6 and every 4&#xD;
      weeks thereafter to week 46 (n=5), (total # doses = 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology: This is a safety study with exploratory assessment of efficacy. The&#xD;
      study has insufficient power to confirm efficacy. All assessments of efficacy will be&#xD;
      exploratory for the purpose of hypothesis-generation in larger sample sizes.&#xD;
