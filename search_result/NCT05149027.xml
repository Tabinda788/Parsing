      until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable tolerability or treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      through withdrawal of consent occurs, whichever happens first.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  A safety follow-up period: 28 days after the last dose of study drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment follow-up visit: day 84 after the last dose of study drug;&#xD;
