  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the leading health problems imbibing a major portion&#xD;
      of health budget worldwide. The global prevalence of CKD is estimated to be 13.4% with&#xD;
      approximately 5 to 7 million people needing renal replacement therapy. There is lack of&#xD;
      epidemiological surveys regarding CKD but it is estimated to be around 5% and nearly half of&#xD;
      them are diabetic. In Pakistan most of the patients undergo hemodialysis as mode of renal&#xD;
      replacement as renal transplant centers are few and over burdened. Therefore, a good vascular&#xD;
      access for hemodialysis is vital for CKD patients. A functioning arterio-venous fistula (AVF)&#xD;
      improves quality of life and morbidity. However, access failure remains a major problem in&#xD;
      patients of CKD accounting for third most common cause of admission. There are various&#xD;
      options for attaining vascular access but AVF remains the most reliable with less morbidity&#xD;
      and better overall patency rate. However, the AVF has its own limitation and has overall&#xD;
      patency rate of 50-70% at 1 year and 30-40% at 2 years. This outcome indicates that&#xD;
      strategies to prevent occlusion by altering modifiable risk factors are suboptimal and&#xD;
      warrant further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of CKD often have associated cardiovascular diseases as Ischemic heart disease, left&#xD;
      ventricular failure and angina. They are often taking cardio-protective medicines as&#xD;
      antiplatelets, angiotensin converting enzymes and calcium channel blockers. Intimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia has been shown to be the most important cause of AVF failures.2 Angiotensin II&#xD;
      promotes vascular smooth muscle proliferation through various growth factors. Various&#xD;
      experimental models have clearly depicted that ACE inhibitors effectively stop smooth muscle&#xD;
      growth and intimal hyperplasia in vessel walls. Literature review shows conflicting results&#xD;
      in terms of AVF patency when ACE inhibitors are used in conjunction. A study by Jackson RS&#xD;
      and colleagues showed that ACE inhibitor were associated with reduced hazard ratio [HR],&#xD;
      0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.76; P = .008). Whereas, another study showed no&#xD;
      role of ACE inhibitors in preventing graft failure. The possible explanation can be study&#xD;
      designs as most studies were retrospective and effects of possible confounders. Moreover,&#xD;
      there is lack of research in Pakistan to see the effects of pharmacological drugs on primary&#xD;
      patency of AVF among CKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this study is to effectively establish the role of ACE inhibitors in&#xD;
      achieving primary patency of AV fistulas while reducing the number of confounders. This will&#xD;
      be the first randomized controlled trial conducted in Pakistan. The primary outcome is AVF&#xD;
      patency at one year. Secondary outcomes will include graft complications and graft maturation&#xD;
      time after surgery.&#xD;
