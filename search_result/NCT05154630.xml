    <textblock>
      This study is divided into two phases: dose escalation and cohort expansion. The dose&#xD;
      escalation stage aims to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and&#xD;
      safety of TQB2858 injection in subjects with advanced malignant tumors. The cohort expansion&#xD;
      phase aims to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of TQB2858 injection in patients with&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcoma, and to explore treatment-related biomarkers.&#xD;
