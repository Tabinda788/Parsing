  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a genetic&#xD;
      disorder where the body does not create enough of a protein called clotting factor 8 (FVIII)&#xD;
      present in the blood. People with hemophilia A may bleed for a long time from minor wounds,&#xD;
      have painful bleeding into joints, or have internal bleeding. In severe hemophilia A&#xD;
      (clotting factor 8 levels less than 1%) bleedings are more likely to happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers want to learn more about the treatment called BAY94-9027.&#xD;
      BAY94-9027 is an injectable medicine used to replace missing clotting factor 8. In BAY94-9027&#xD;
      the clotting factor 8 has been pegylated (combined with a substance called polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol (PEG)). This is to make the treatment last longer in the body so that less injections&#xD;
      are required. BAY94-9027 is already available for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in&#xD;
      adults and children who are 12 years and older. BAY 94-9027 is also called Jivi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAY94-9027 is not yet available for children aged 7 to less than 12 years. One potential&#xD;
      specific risk of pegylated drugs is that proteins in the blood called antibodies are built.&#xD;
      These may attach to the pegylation part of the drug and this in turn may lead to allergic&#xD;
      reactions and the drug not working as well as it should during first 4 infusions. In studies&#xD;
      that have been done so far, this has been seen in some children younger than six years, but&#xD;
      not in 29 children aged 6 to less than 12 years treated with BAY94-9027. Further safety&#xD;
      information related to how the body reacts to BAY94-9027 is however still needed for this age&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to learn how safe BAY94-9027 is (safety) and how it affects&#xD;
      the body (tolerability) in previously treated children with severe hemophilia A who are&#xD;
      between 7 to less than 12 years. To answer this question, the researchers will study&#xD;
      information about two medical problems of special interest, if allergic reactions occur (also&#xD;
      called hypersensitivity) and if the drug is not working as well as it should (also called&#xD;
      loss of efficacy) during the first 4 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic reactions may range from mild local reactions to widespread effects such as&#xD;
      shortness of breath, skin rashes and low blood pressure. Only allergic reactions related to&#xD;
      the study treatment will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment if loss of efficacy occurred will be based on the occurrence of bleeding, the&#xD;
      clotting factor VIII level in blood after injection called recovery, FVIII inhibitor tests&#xD;
      and measurement of antibodies against the PEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parts, A and B. Each part takes six months. In part A the participants will&#xD;
      receive two injections of BAY94-9027 per week. In part B, the number of injections may be&#xD;
      decreased, with up to five days between the injections. The participants in this study will&#xD;
      visit the study site around 12 times and will have 6 phone visits. In the beginning of part A&#xD;
      there will be 2 visits per week for two weeks. In the remainder of part A, there will be one&#xD;
      visit every 4 weeks. In part B, there will be a phone visit per month and a study site visit&#xD;
      every 3 months. The participants' and their caregivers will record in an electronic patient&#xD;
      diary information about when the study treatment was given and bleeding episodes that have&#xD;
      happened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the study doctors and their team will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take blood samples,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  do physical examinations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  review the participants' electronic diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask questions about the participants' quality of life,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they&#xD;
           are having An adverse event is a medical problem that happens during the study. Doctors&#xD;
           keep track of all adverse events that happen in study, even if they do not think the&#xD;
           adverse events might be related to the study treatments.&#xD;
