  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label, observational cohort study conducted to collect demographics, clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and outcome observational data from children (6-17 years) with a clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of severe asthma in 2 countries (Spain and United Kingdom), in public institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants who have a physician decision to initiate mepolizumab treatment and&#xD;
      are consented for the study will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have received mepolizumab (Nucala) since authorisation by EMEA in September&#xD;
      2018 (in Spain since December 2019) as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic&#xD;
      asthma in paediatric patients aged six up to 17 years. The study will be implemented in 16&#xD;
      investigating sites (10 in Spain and 6 in UK). The assignment of a patient to a particular&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by the study protocol, but is determined by&#xD;
      the usual practice of medicine, and the decision to prescribe a particular drug is clearly&#xD;
      dissociated from the decision to include the patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will meet the local reimbursement criteria. The study will be managed&#xD;
      by IQVIA. No patient-identifying information will be transferred to the sponsor nor the CRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No visits should be scheduled specifically for this observational study, data will be&#xD;
      collected at usual asthma healthcare visits (routine or unscheduled, remote or face to face).&#xD;
      If a participant is seen by their physician for monthly mepolizumab injections, data for&#xD;
      healthcare utilization, asthma medications and any recent lung function assessment will be&#xD;
      collected on a monthly basis. When the participant is seen less frequently by their physician&#xD;
      (for example when mepolizumab injection is given at a different site or at home) this data&#xD;
      will be collected at usual asthma healthcare visits, which are likely to occur less&#xD;
      frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The index date will be defined as the date of the first mepolizumab injection administration&#xD;
      during the study (i.e. treatment initiation). To accommodate local healthcare practice, this&#xD;
      will be according to local healthcare practice.&#xD;
