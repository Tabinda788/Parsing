  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators primary objective is to identify genetic factors that may increase the risk&#xD;
      of patients developing a periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) following total joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TJA). The investigators hope that by identifying genetic predispositions we&#xD;
      will be able to provide patient specific care pathways to prevent or minimize the risk for&#xD;
      PJI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI), and more specifically periprosthetic joint infections (PJI),&#xD;
      have plagued the orthopaedic surgeon since the introduction of total joint arthroplasty (TJA)&#xD;
      procedures of the hip or knee in the mid twentieth century. It is estimated that the economic&#xD;
      burden of PJI in the United States will approach 1.62 billion USD by 2020. Though methods of&#xD;
      infection control have improved, the rate of PJI appears to have plateaued in the last&#xD;
      several decades. Early rates of PJI in the first two decades of THA have been reported&#xD;
      between 1 - 9%. Since the 1980's studies have reported rates between 1% - 3%. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that as orthopaedic surgeons, doctors should not be satisfied with deep infection&#xD;
      rates greater than 1%. Therefore, more must be done in order to prevent, or diminish the&#xD;
      frequency, of PJI and its devastating effects on this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hopes of allowing for early targeted prevention in potentially high-risk patients, risk&#xD;
      calculators have been developed to identify patients at greater risk for developing infection&#xD;
      following TJA. However, some investigators suggest that these scoring systems may not be&#xD;
      ready for primetime use. Thus, further research is needed to improve the ability to&#xD;
      accurately identify individuals at high risk for infection. Unfortunately, the ability to&#xD;
      perform large scale longitudinal cohort studies needed to create and test these risk&#xD;
      calculators isn't feasible. Thus, other methods of early identification are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic susceptibility testing for identifying patients at risk for disease is becoming more&#xD;
      popular and may be a means by which patients at high-risk for PJI can be identified. A recent&#xD;
      dermatological study on genetic risk factors for infection suggest that host attributes may&#xD;
      play a role in the ability of the individual to be infected. When evaluating the risk of&#xD;
      subsequent different site infection in patients with multiple TJA's, investigators suggest&#xD;
      that some patients may be at greater risk for infection due to possible subclinical immune&#xD;
      deficiencies. In 2013, one investigator reported familial susceptibility to surgical site&#xD;
      infections (SSI), including but not isolated to PJI, through a large population based study.&#xD;
      Further, a recent publication from this investigating institution demonstrated familial&#xD;
      clustering in patients who suffered a PJI, showing an increased risk of PJI following TJA in&#xD;
      relatives of patients who have experienced PJI. These families demonstrated infection rates&#xD;
      of 9 - 17%. After performing a systematic review on the genetic susceptibility to PJI, the&#xD;
      investigators concluded that though evidence exists supporting a genetic role in PJI, no&#xD;
      definitive conclusions can be made given the relatively small amount of data available in the&#xD;
      existing literature. The investigators further emphasize the need for prospective studies to&#xD;
      validate previous findings and the relationship between genetic factors and PJI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the evidence in the literature, the investigators hypothesize that a large familial&#xD;
      study will provide greater evidence of a genetic susceptibility. The results of this study&#xD;
      could validate previous research with smaller sample sizes and allow for early identification&#xD;
      of high-risk patients via genetic susceptibility testing.&#xD;
