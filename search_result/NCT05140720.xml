    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy infants or toddlers, based on medical history and clinical assessment, to be&#xD;
             without acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             hepatobiliary, gastrointestinal, renal, neurological, or hematological functional&#xD;
             abnormality or illness that requires medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infants or toddlers between 6 weeks to 24 months of age at the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Voluntary written informed consent by subject's parents to have the subject&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject's parents being able to comprehend and comply with study requirements and&#xD;
             procedures and able and willing to complete subject diary, to return with the subject&#xD;
             for all scheduled follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects born full-term with a weight-to-length Z score of ≥ -2 (WHO child growth&#xD;
             standard) at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject with an up-to-date minimal vaccination status for age at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment as per National Immunization Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject's parents having a readily identifiable place of residence in the study area,&#xD;
             being available for the duration of trial participation, with means of telephone&#xD;
             contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of any investigational medicinal product prior to randomization or planned use of&#xD;
             such a product (other than study vaccine) during the period of study participation.&#xD;
             Previous vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection confirmed by culture from a normally&#xD;
             sterile site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergic disease or history of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination&#xD;
             or known hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccines. This included such&#xD;
             reactions in older siblings and also includes all components of the vaccines of&#xD;
             expanded program on immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of anaphylactic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any abnormal (Grade ≥ 1) vital sign. Note: For fever, axillary temperature of ≥ 37.5°C&#xD;
             was considered significant and was repeated to determine whether a subject is eligible&#xD;
             for randomization. A minimum of 48 hours following resolution of documented fever&#xD;
             needed to pass before the subject could be reassessed for eligibility. The last vital&#xD;
             sign measurement was used as the baseline value for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any moderate or severe (Grade ≥ 2) acute illness Note: Infants with a Grade 1 acute&#xD;
             illness were enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with moderate or severe acute illness would return for clinical&#xD;
             reassessment; if the illness had sufficiently resolved, they might still qualify for&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days) of immunosuppressant&#xD;
             or other immune modifying drugs prior to the administration of the study vaccine,&#xD;
             including the use of glucocorticoids. The use of topical and inhaled glucocorticoids&#xD;
             will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of administration of a non-study pneumococcal vaccine prior to administration&#xD;
             of study vaccine or during the course of study participation (other vaccinations of&#xD;
             expanded program on Immunization are accepted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products or anticipation of such&#xD;
             administration during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of known disturbance of coagulation or blood disorder that could cause anemia&#xD;
             or excess bleeding (e.g., coagulation factor deficiencies, severe anemia at birth).&#xD;
             Any clearly documented history in a first-degree relative (e.g., parent, sibling) of&#xD;
             the same was also exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of suspected primary immunodeficiency. Any clearly documented history in a&#xD;
             first-degree relative of the same was also exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject had a sibling die of likely sudden infant death syndrome or die suddenly and&#xD;
             without apparent other cause or preceding illness in the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Evidence of a clinically significant congenital abnormality as judged by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of meningitis, seizures or any neurological disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Evidence by history taking alone of exposure to an HIV-positive individual through&#xD;
             maternal fetal transmission, breast milk, or other blood-borne mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject being a direct descendant (child or grandchild) of any person employed by the&#xD;
             Sponsor, the contract research organization (CRO), the PI, study site personnel, or&#xD;
             department.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Any medical or social condition that in the opinion of the PI might interfere with the&#xD;
             study objectives, pose a risk to the subject, or prevent the subject from completing&#xD;
             the study follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The specific exclusion criteria (e.g., abnormal vital sign, acute illness) were&#xD;
        reassessed at all vaccination visits. Any subject who was not vaccinated due to an acute&#xD;
        abnormality assessed at the 2nd or 3rd vaccination visit (V2 or V3) would return once the&#xD;
        acute issue has resolved. A minimum of 48 hours must have passed after a documented fever&#xD;
        before a subject could be vaccinated. This safety requirement was not deemed a protocol&#xD;
        deviation if the visit fell outside the vaccination window; however, it was encouraged to&#xD;
        maintain the vaccination window whenever possible in these situations.&#xD;
