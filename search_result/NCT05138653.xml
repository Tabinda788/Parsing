    <intervention_model_description>Part A of the trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 4-period, 4-sequence, crossover design to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of single doses of CVL-354 in healthy participants. Except for a potential food effect period, all treatments will be administered under fasted conditions.&#xD;
Part B of the trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate PK, safety, and tolerability of CVL-354 in multiple ascending doses.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Up to 29 days following last dose with IMP</time_frame>
    <description>Any AE occurring following the start of treatment or occurring before treatment but increasing in severity afterward will be counted as treatment-emergent AE (TEAE).</description>

    <measure>Primary Part A&amp;B: Changes in suicidality assessed using the Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 17 days following last dose with IMP</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS includes 'yes' or 'no' responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe). Greater lethality or potential lethality of suicidal behaviors (endorsed on the Behavior subscale) indicates increased risk.</description>

The starting dose of CVL-354 will be 0.5 mg. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences.
