    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of APG-2575 single agent in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an single-arm, open-label, multi-center, pivotal registration Phase II study of&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of APG-2575 as a single agent in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll approximately 75 CLL/SLL subjects who have failed or are&#xD;
      intolerant to prior immunochemotherapy and BTK inhibitor therapy. Eligible subjects will&#xD;
      receive APG-2575 600mg, orally administered once daily (QD), within half an hour of a low-fat&#xD;
      meal, for a cycle of 28 days. Participants will continue to accept APG - 2575 until the &quot;end&#xD;
      of treatment&quot; that are consistent with the provisions in the solution of the termination of&#xD;
      any specified standards.&#xD;
