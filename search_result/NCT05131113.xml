    <textblock>
      Multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to the control&#xD;
      group or the intervention group in each of the health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive the usual care, while the intervention group will add an&#xD;
      individualized physical exercise program to the usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer is a disease of the elderly. More than 65% of all malignancies affect this population.&#xD;
      At the same time, the incidence of cancer cases increases and the need to better understand&#xD;
      the biological characteristics of the disease, as well as those of the elderly who suffer&#xD;
      from it, is highlighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncogeriatrics is the area that addresses the care of the elderly patient with cancer, taking&#xD;
      into account that physiological aging causes older people to have their own characteristics&#xD;
      that require a differential approach in care. The low inclusion in clinical trials of elderly&#xD;
      patients and the few specific trials carried out in this subpopulation together with the&#xD;
      progressive aging of the population mean that the development of this area has become a&#xD;
      priority in health policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to focus the research area on supervised physical exercise in&#xD;
      older people with cancer in an innovative way, with the aim of generating new hypotheses that&#xD;
      overcome existing limitations and facilitate the introduction into the health system of this&#xD;
      type of interventions.&#xD;

      It seems useful to have instruments that help to objectively evaluate the fragilty and&#xD;
      comorbidity of patients with the intention of adequately indicating the administration of&#xD;
      antineoplastic treatment. In addition, nowadays, with the arrival of new less toxic&#xD;
      treatments, it is essential to make a good selection of the patients to be treated, since&#xD;
      there is a risk of treating patients who are not going to benefit from an active treatment&#xD;
      just for having more comfortable medications and with less toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several instruments that can help to better select the patients that the&#xD;
      investigators are going to treat and to select the supportive care that can help to better&#xD;
      tolerate the proposed treatments while maintaining the best possible quality of life. Some of&#xD;
      those instruments are aimed at detecting fragility such as comprehensive geriatric&#xD;
      assessment. They identify in more detail the different vulnerabilities that can affect the&#xD;
      patient in the benefit vs. toxicity balance of the treatment and in the long-term quality of&#xD;
      life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many authors emphasize the importance of including a physical exercise program during and&#xD;
      after cancer treatment. Despite this, older people with cancer usually have low levels of&#xD;
      physical activity, and few adhere to the recommendations they receive from health centers.&#xD;
      For this reason, involving older people with cancer in a regular physical activity program&#xD;
      becomes a challenge for those in charge of health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have shown that physical exercise can reduce the usual loss of functional&#xD;
      capacity and reduce frailty during cancer treatment. On the other hand, physical exercise can&#xD;
      help reduce pain, toxicity and improve the completion rate of systemic treatment. Recent&#xD;
      studies have found that physical exercise on the days of chemotherapy cycles is safe and may&#xD;
      be beneficial in reducing neuropathy and maintaining physical well-being. Additionally,&#xD;
      physical exercise can impact one of the most common and strenuous adverse effects of cancer&#xD;
      treatment, fatigue.&#xD;
