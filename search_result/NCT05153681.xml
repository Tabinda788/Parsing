  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Plantar Fascia (PF) is a thick, fibrous sheath located in the middle of the sole of the&#xD;
      foot, starting from the tuber calcanei in the calcaneus and extending to the level of the&#xD;
      middle phalanges. Plantar Fasciitis (PFs) is inflammation and thickening of the PF where it&#xD;
      attaches to the calcaneus. PFs are the most common cause of heel pain. Diagnosis is made by&#xD;
      physical examination and radiological examinations. On physical examination, there is&#xD;
      localized tenderness medial to the calcaneal tuberosity. In the treatment of plantar&#xD;
      fasciitis, there are many applied methods such as anti-inflammatory agents, orthostotic&#xD;
      supports, night splints, physical therapy, corticosteroid applications, night splint use,&#xD;
      plastering, rest, lifestyle modification, laser, taping, exercise and ESWT. Kinesio tapes,&#xD;
      which have been used in the conservative treatment of plantar fasciitis in recent years, are&#xD;
      elastic tapes similar to the structural properties and flexibility of human skin, without&#xD;
      limiting joint movements. Peloidotherapy is a special balneotherapy method made with natural&#xD;
      mud. In both domestic and international scientific studies on peloid treatment, it has been&#xD;
      shown that pain in patients decreases, physical functions improve, quality of life increases,&#xD;
      and the amount of painkillers use decreases. We could not find any study comparing&#xD;
      Peloidotherapy and Kinesioband methods routinely used in the treatment of PF in the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;

      The Plantar Fascia (PF) is a thick, fibrous sheath located in the middle of the sole of the&#xD;
      foot, starting from the tuber calcanei in the calcaneus and extending to the level of the&#xD;
      middle phalanges. It is a tendinous aponeurosis rather than a true layer of fascia and is an&#xD;
      important static support for the longitudinal arch of the foot. Plantar Fasciitis (PFs) is&#xD;
      inflammation and thickening of the PF where it attaches to the calcaneus. PFs are the most&#xD;
      common cause of heel pain. It has been reported to occur in 10% of people during their&#xD;
      lifetime. It is more common between the ages of 40-60. Although its main etiology is not&#xD;
      fully understood, the most common theory is; microscopic tears as a result of mechanical&#xD;
      overstretching of the fascia followed by chronic inflammation, but histological studies lack&#xD;
      evidence to support inflammation. Diagnosis is made by physical examination and radiological&#xD;
      examinations (ultrasonography, radiography). On physical examination, there is localized&#xD;
      tenderness medial to the calcaneal tuberosity. In the treatment of plantar fasciitis, there&#xD;
      are many applied methods such as anti-inflammatory agents, orthostotic supports, night&#xD;
      splints, physical therapy, corticosteroid applications, night splint use, plastering, rest,&#xD;
      lifestyle modification, laser, taping, exercise and ESWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio tapes, which have been used in the conservative treatment of plantar fasciitis in&#xD;
      recent years, are elastic tapes similar to the structural properties and flexibility of human&#xD;
      skin, without limiting joint movements. Kinesio taping technique provides physiological&#xD;
      effects on skin, fascia, muscle and joint. After applying kinesio tape, it raises the skin in&#xD;
      the taped area, increasing the space between it and the muscles and relieving the pressure in&#xD;
      that area. It also helps to reduce tension and sensitivity by increasing blood circulation&#xD;
      and prevents stimulation of pain receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peloids (medical mud) are organic or inorganic substances formed as a result of geological&#xD;
      and/or biological events. They can be found in nature as fine particles, or they are made&#xD;
      into small, fine particles by some preliminary preparation processes. Peloidotherapy is a&#xD;
      special balneotherapy method made with natural mud. It is used in the treatment of diseases&#xD;
      such as degenerative joint diseases, soft tissue rheumatism, lumbardiscopathy, cervical&#xD;
      discopathy, chronic low back and neck pain, joint pain. In both national and international&#xD;
      scientific studies on peloid treatment, it has been shown that pain in patients decreases,&#xD;
      physical functions improve, quality of life increases, and the amount of painkillers use&#xD;
      decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We could not find any study comparing Peloidotherapy and Kinesioband methods routinely used&#xD;
      in the treatment of PF in the literature.&#xD;

    <description>Peloid therapy; A total of 10 sessions were applied for 30 minutes by heating the proximal part of the sole of the foot, including the heel part, at a temperature of 45 degrees. Kinesioband application: One strip is prepared as a rake with a length of about 25 cm, and the other strip is prepared as an I tape with a length of about 20 cm. The ankle is in a neutral position of 90 degrees. Lymphatic and mechanical correction technique is applied. Afterwards, the band is activated.</description>
