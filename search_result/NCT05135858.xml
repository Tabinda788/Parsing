  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dose intravenous Methotrexate (HD-MTX) is the key drug in the treatment of primary&#xD;
      central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). HD-MTX is usually delivered with time interval&#xD;
      ranging from 10 to 21 days. Reduction of injection time interval is limited by MTX renal&#xD;
      excretion and systemic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucarpidase (CPG2) is a recombinant bacterial rescue enzyme that cleaves circulating MTX&#xD;
      into inactive metabolites, reducing plasma MTX concentrations within few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is that CPG2 used after HD-MTX injection allows to reduce time&#xD;
      interval between MTX injections, increase dose intensity of the chemotherapy, reduce systemic&#xD;
      toxicity and duration of hospitalization.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Open-label multicenter Phase I dose finding trial based on 3+3 escalation design. The phase I&#xD;
      will follow a standard &quot;3+3&quot; dose level escalation design with reduced time interval of&#xD;
      HD-MTX injections at fixed dose of HD-MTX to establish the minimum tolerated time interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD-MTX (methotrexate) is administered intravenously at the dose 3.5 g/m² (body surface area&#xD;
      capped at 2 m2) over 2 to 3 hours, followed at H24 by glucarpidase with a 3 different MTX&#xD;
      administration intervals: 8 days, 6 days, and 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be continued for a maximum of 6 injections until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or investigator's/patient's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dose levels could be explored under toxicity restrictions, where the dose combination&#xD;
      for each cohort of three subjects will be determined by 3+3 escalation rule. Three schedule&#xD;
      dose levels will be : every 8 days, every 6 days and every 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting schedule dose of HD-MTX will be one administration of HD-MTX every 8 days for 6&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of MTX will be fixed and will not be modified. No skipping of the dose level will be&#xD;
      allowed. No intra-patient dose escalation is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DLT evaluation period begins with the first dose of methotrexate and ends at the&#xD;
      beginning of the 25th day after the first MTX infusion.&#xD;
