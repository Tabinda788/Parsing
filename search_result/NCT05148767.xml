      To explore whether the application of irinotecan under the guidance of UGT1A1 gene in&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer could improve&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy in the real world.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) combined with surgery is the standard care of treatment&#xD;
      for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), which could effectively reduce the risk of local&#xD;
      recurrence, increase the chance of sphincter preservation, and effectively improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients. However, only about 8% of patients can benefit from nCRT.&#xD;
      Therefore, to improve the therapeutic effect of nCRT and retain the organ function of&#xD;
      patients so as to improve their quality of life is the focus of the current investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous study, the investigator have completed a series of clinical researches of&#xD;
      irinotecan guided by UGT1A1 gene for nCRT in rectal cancer. A dose climbing study was firstly&#xD;
      conducted to explore the maximum tolerable dose of irinotecan for nCRT in rectal cancer. The&#xD;
      results indicated that the weekly dose intensity of irinotecan could be increased from&#xD;
      50mg/m2 to 80mg/m2 when the genotype of UGT1A1*28 locus was 6/6, and the weekly dose&#xD;
      intensity of irinotecan could also reach 65mg/m2 when the genotype of irinotecan was 6/7&#xD;
      phenotype. Further analysis also demonstrated that there was a dose-effect relationship&#xD;
      between the total dose of irinotecan and pathological complete remission (pCR). The recently&#xD;
      published CinClare study is a 3-phase randomized controlled trial that doubles the pCR rate&#xD;
      and the total CR rate in combination with irinotecan on the basis of capecitabine combined&#xD;
      with radiotherapy. However, in the Aristotle study conducted in the United Kingdom at the&#xD;
      same phase, it has not been proved that irinotecan could improve the pCR rate, and it is not&#xD;
      known whether the difference between the two studies is completely attributed to the&#xD;
      irinotecan dose. Therefore, the investigator designed this real-world study to explore&#xD;
      whether irinotecan can indeed improve the treatment efficacy in the real world when using&#xD;
      irinotecan under the guidance of UGT1A1 gene in nCRT for LARC. Any locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer patients treated with irinotecan-based neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy can&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study. It is expected that the results of this study could provide more&#xD;
      basis for individualized treatment of LARC.&#xD;
