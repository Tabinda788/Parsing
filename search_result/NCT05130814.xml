  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical study aims to verify the effectiveness and safety of the blue light&#xD;
      photobiomodulation therapy with EmoLED medical device in supporting the reparative process of&#xD;
      the area of the second and third stage decubitus lesion, comparing this method with the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the therapy commonly used in the clinical field.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PU), also known as decubitus sores, are areas of lesion localized to the&#xD;
      skin and subcutaneous tissue. The development of decubitus ulcers occurs in institutional and&#xD;
      community environments, and more frequently in assisted elderly, debilitated and motionless&#xD;
      (e.g. orthopedic patients), in patients with severe acute disease (e.g. hospitalized in&#xD;
      intensive care units) and in subjects with neurological deficits (e.g. spinal injuries).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing the considerable economic, health and social impact of pressure ulcers has led to&#xD;
      considerable efforts to reduce their occurrence. Nevertheless, pressure ulcers continue to&#xD;
      occur. Although not all pressure ulcers are iatrogenic, most of them can be prevented.&#xD;
      Pressure ulcers are one of the most frequent iatrogenic lesions in developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate treatment methods, such as leaving vulnerable patients in potentially harmful&#xD;
      positions for long periods, or massaging reddened skin areas, often continue to be&#xD;
      perpetuated even if it has been proven that they are damaging or ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure, that is often associated to a limitation in mobility of the patient, for a long&#xD;
      time has been considered the most important extrinsic factor in the development of pressure&#xD;
      ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, recent research, and still ongoing, is revealing that shear forces, friction, and&#xD;
      microclimate also play an important role in the etiology of pressure ulcers, and that, also,&#xD;
      some significant and complex relationships between all these extrinsic factors exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In alert patients, the effects of prolonged pressure usually stimulate frequent light body&#xD;
      movements to relieve the load and restore tissue perfusion. Unconscious, sedated,&#xD;
      anesthetized or paralyzed patients cannot feel or respond to these stimuli and do not move&#xD;
      spontaneously. As a result, skin and soft tissue can be exposed to prolonged and without&#xD;
      relief pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUs are generally more common in anatomical locations that cover a bone prominence. In&#xD;
      adults, the most common sites are the sacrum and the heel. Other frequently affected&#xD;
      anatomical locations are ischium, ankle, elbow and hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure ulcers are often difficult to diagnose, in particular it is easy to confuse them&#xD;
      with moisture-caused injuries. A correct diagnosis is essential to determine both prevention&#xD;
      and treatment plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a proper management of pressure lesions it is essential to take into account their&#xD;
      characteristics (location, color, size, amount of exudate, type of tissue, smell, edges) and&#xD;
      to consider the condition of the peri-lesional skin (erythema, edema, hardening, maceration).&#xD;
      To describe the state of a pressure ulcer, EPUAP (European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel) and&#xD;
      NPUAP (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel) recommend to divide pressure injuries stages&#xD;
      from 1 to 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1 - Persistent erythema Intact skin with redness not reversible to acupressure in&#xD;
           a localized area, usually above a bone prominence. Stage 1 may indicate a patient at&#xD;
           risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2 - Partial thickness tissue loss Loss of the dermis at partial thickness, which&#xD;
           looks like a shallow and open ulcer, with red - pinkish lesion bed, without slough. It&#xD;
           may also present as a vesicle, intact or open/broken, serous and/or haematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 3 - Total Thickness Tissue Loss Loss of tissue at total thickness. Subcutaneous&#xD;
           fat may be visible, but bones, tendons or muscles are not exposed. There may be slough,&#xD;
           which does not hide the depth of tissue loss. It may include undermining wounds and&#xD;
           tunneling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 4 - Loss of subcutaneous tissue Loss of tissue at total thickness with exposure of&#xD;
           bones, tendons or muscles. There may be slough or eschar on some parts of the lesion&#xD;
           bed. Undermining wounds and tunneling are often present. Stage 4 injuries can extend to&#xD;
           muscle and to support structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not classifiable lesion Loss of tissue at total thickness, where the base of the ulcer&#xD;
           is covered by slough (yellow, brown, grey, green or brown) and/or eschar (brown, brown&#xD;
           or black) in the bed of the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commercial purpose of this study is to value the clinical efficacy of a battery-powered&#xD;
      device that uses blue LEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to compare the response of an existing standard treatment for second and third&#xD;
      stage pressure sores, with a protocol that plans the administration of the EmoLED treatment&#xD;
      three times a week for 4 consecutive weeks in addition to the conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study has an indicative duration of 12 months with an expected enrollment period of 10&#xD;
      months. The study, however, will continue until the number of patients required by this&#xD;
      protocol is reached.&#xD;

    <description>The Control Group will follow the standard treatment indicated three times a week for the 4 weeks of observation.&#xD;
The standard treatment for 2° and 3° stage PU consists of: cleansing with saline or ringer's lactate, hyaluronic acid gauze plus polyurethane foam every 48 hours or as needed. In addition, zinc cream or hyaluronic acid sodium salt + metallic silver is applied to prevent and/or treat the skin maceration of the surrounding area, and eventual debridement of the lesion, application of topical treatment indicated for that stage of the lesion (as provided by the &quot;Protocol on pressure ulcers' dressing&quot; intended as the &quot;standard of care&quot; of the structure) and subsequent bandage (that generally consists of a polyurethane film -thin hydrocolloid plate or a pressure discharge system made with hydrocolloids and polyurethane foam, known as &quot;pressure relief system&quot;), are planned.</description>

    <description>The Experimental Group will undergo, in addition to the standard treatment, treatment with Emoled three times a week for 4 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
This treatment consists of irradiation with the blue light emitted by the device for one minute on the injured area. If the lesion has a greater extension than the irradiated area, multiple repeated applications will be performed, on adjacent areas, until the entire area is covered.&#xD;
The treatment with EmoLED will be carried out in correspondence with the dressing change of the lesion.</description>
