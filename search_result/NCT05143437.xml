  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional stressors and challenges to couples'&#xD;
      relationships, with potential ripple effects across all family subsystems and child&#xD;
      adjustment. Among those who are particularly vulnerable to heightened conflict and lower&#xD;
      relationship satisfaction during this time are couples with young children, whose&#xD;
      relationships may have already been tenuous prior to the pandemic. The Love Together Parent&#xD;
      Together (L2P2) program is a brief, low-intensity writing intervention adapted for parents of&#xD;
      young children, designed to reduce conflict-related distress and prevent relationship&#xD;
      deterioration. Based on an original writing program by Finkel and colleagues, adaptations&#xD;
      include intervention duration and study population. The current study will examine key&#xD;
      feasibility metrics related to this adapted intervention program with the goal of identifying&#xD;
      problems and informing parameters of future pilot and/or main randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCT). The current study is a non-randomised feasibility study, using a single-arm,&#xD;
      pre-test/post-test design to primarily assess the feasibility of a large trial, and&#xD;
      secondarily to assess the potential effects on outcomes to be used in a future RCT. Couples&#xD;
      will be recruited through three community-based agencies with the goal of obtaining a&#xD;
      socio-demographically diverse sample. The first 20 couples to enroll will be included.&#xD;
      Baseline and post-intervention surveys will be conducted, and a writing intervention will&#xD;
      take place (three 7-minute sessions over the course of four weeks). The primary feasibility&#xD;
      metrics will include recruitment rates, appropriateness of eligibility criteria, sample&#xD;
      diversity, retention, uptake, and adherence, and acceptability. In addition, the researchers&#xD;
      will develop an objective primary outcome measure of couple &quot;we-ness&quot; based on analysis of&#xD;
      writing samples. The secondary outcomes will include couples' measures (i.e., relationship&#xD;
      quality, perceived partner responsiveness, self-reported partner responsiveness,&#xD;
      conflict-related distress), and other family outcomes (i.e., parent-child relations,&#xD;
      parental/child mental health, and parenting practices). Criteria for success are outlined and&#xD;
      failure to meet criteria will result in adaptations to measurement schedule, intervention&#xD;
      design, recruitment approaches, and/or other elements of the study design. This feasibility&#xD;
      study will inform several components of the procedures used for a subsequent pilot RCT, which&#xD;
      will examine the feasibility of the methodology used to evaluate the program (e.g.,&#xD;
      randomization, attrition to follow up assessment/across groups, and sample size estimation,&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness), and a main trial, which will investigate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention on primary outcome measures as well as mediating pathways.&#xD;
