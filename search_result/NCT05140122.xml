  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dravet syndrome is a rare form of severe epilepsy that begins in the first year of life and&#xD;
      is associated with frequent and/or prolonged seizures. Individuals with Dravet Syndrome often&#xD;
      experience a range of comorbidities, including behavioral and developmental delays, movement&#xD;
      and balance issues, sleep difficulties, chronic infections, and growth and nutritional&#xD;
      issues. Patients with Dravet syndrome are at high risk of death due to SUDEP (Sudden&#xD;
      Unexpected Death in Epilepsy), prolonged seizures, seizure-related accidents, and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the severity of this condition, parents of children with Dravet syndrome are typically&#xD;
      highly involved in their child's 24-hour care and this has a considerable impact on family&#xD;
      life. Recent studies have highlighted the profound impact that such caregiving has on&#xD;
      physical health, mental health, social function and financial resources. In particular,&#xD;
      caregivers report high levels of stress and anxiety, fatigue, depression and social&#xD;
      isolation. However, there is currently a lack of effective interventions to reduce the&#xD;
      negative impact of caregiving on caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively study carers of individuals with Dravet syndrome to&#xD;
      identify pharmacological and psychological factors that are associated with increased or&#xD;
      decreased vulnerability to stress, depression and anxiety. Using a naturalistic,&#xD;
      observational design the investigators will assess a cohort of Dravet Syndrome carers every&#xD;
      six months for 3 years in order to further characterise trajectories of caregiver burden and&#xD;
      the factors that influence this, including factors related to the person with Dravet syndrome&#xD;
      (e.g. age, seizure frequency/severity, treatment/medications, comorbidities) and factors&#xD;
      related to the carer and family environment (e.g. social engagement/isolation, fatigue,&#xD;
      finances, relationships). The investigators will use both standardized questionnaires and a&#xD;
      neurocognitive task (Facial Expression Recognition Task) to assess vulnerability to anxiety&#xD;
      and depression. The study will be conducted online.&#xD;
