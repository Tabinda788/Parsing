      To evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of arthroscopic Chinese Unique Inlay&#xD;
      Bristow procedure (Cuistow procedure) and arthroscopic Bristow procedure in treating&#xD;
      recurrent anterior shoulder instability.&#xD;

      Aim: To compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes following the arthroscopic Chinese&#xD;
      Unique Inlay Bristow (Cuistow) procedure and the arthroscopic Bristow procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The Cuistow procedure is a modified Bristow surgery in which a Mortise and Tenon&#xD;
      structure was added to the contact surface between the coracoid tip and the glenoid. In&#xD;
      previous study, patients received Cuistow procedure have satisfying clinical performance and&#xD;
      excellent postoperative bone healing rate (96.1%). However, no comparative studies was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Retrospective comparative case-cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients who underwent the arthroscopic Cuisotw procedure and modified Bristow&#xD;
      procedure between Jan 2017 and Mar 2018 were selected. 70 patients with recurrent anterior&#xD;
      shoulder instability were included. Radiological evaluations with 3D CT scan were performed&#xD;
      preoperatively, immediately after the operation, and postoperatively at three months and&#xD;
      during the final follow-up (more than 2 years). Clinical assessment for a minimum of 24&#xD;
      months including the 10-point visual analog scale for pain and subjective instability,&#xD;
      University of California at Los Angeles scoring system (UCLA score), American Shoulder and&#xD;
      Elbow Surgeons score (ASES score), ROWE score, Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) and active&#xD;
      range of motion were completed by independent observers and analyzed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2-year postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES score (Michener 2002) is a 10-item measure of shoulder pain and function. Pain is assessed on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and accounts for 50% of the total score. The remaining 50% of the score is determined by the responses to 10 4-point Likert-scale questions related to physical function.</description>

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain score is the most commonly used to describe pain levels in patients, ranging from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating more intense pain.</description>
