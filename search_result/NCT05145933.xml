      Mathematica, funded by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Office of Planning,&#xD;
      Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)&#xD;
      will collect descriptive information for the Head Start REACH: Strengthening Outreach,&#xD;
      Recruitment and Engagement Approaches with Families (Head Start REACH) study. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct qualitative case studies in six sites. The goal of these case&#xD;
      studies in the Head Start REACH study is to provide an in-depth understanding of (1) the&#xD;
      approaches that are likely to be successful for the recruitment, selection, enrollment, and&#xD;
      retention (RSER) of families who are experiencing adversities; (2) the factors that affect&#xD;
      the implementation of these approaches and; (3) the experiences of such families, both&#xD;
      enrolled and non-enrolled in Head Start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will occur in spring 2022. The investigators will conduct qualitative,&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with staff across the six sites who are involved in RSER efforts&#xD;
      and provide services to families experiencing adversities, including those in Head Start&#xD;
      programs and in the community organizations with which the programs partner. The&#xD;
      investigators will also conduct focus groups with families who are being served by Head Start&#xD;
      programs and/or the community partner organizations.&#xD;

      This study aims to advance understanding of the approaches that programs use for the&#xD;
      recruitment, selection, enrollment, and retention (RSER) of families who are experiencing&#xD;
      adversities; the implementation of those approaches; and the experience of Head&#xD;
      Start-eligible families (both enrolled and not enrolled in Head Start). Adversities is a&#xD;
      broad term that refers to a wide range of circumstances or events that pose a threat to a&#xD;
      child or caregiver's physical or psychological well-being. The adversities that families&#xD;
      experience are often intertwined with poverty, may co-occur, and are affected by systematic&#xD;
      factors, such as structural racism. Common examples include (but are not limited to) families&#xD;
      experiencing homelessness; involvement in child welfare, including foster care; and affected&#xD;
      by substance use, mental health issues, and domestic violence. Data from these case studies&#xD;
      will inform the development of the study's conceptual framework, identify knowledge gaps, and&#xD;
      inform the design of a future large-scale descriptive study. Ultimately, this information&#xD;
      collection will support ACF in better understanding how Head Start programs recruit, select,&#xD;
      enroll, and retain families and inform Head Start's efforts to achieve its mission of&#xD;
      advancing equitable outcomes for children and families. In addition, these case studies may&#xD;
      identify promising approaches for engaging underserved populations and help Head Start&#xD;
      utilize more effective case management and coordination strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected is meant to contribute to the body of knowledge on ACF programs. It&#xD;
      is not intended to be used as the principal basis for a decision by a federal decision-maker&#xD;
      and is not expected to meet the threshold of influential or highly influential scientific&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the following data collection activities, to be carried out in&#xD;
      spring 2022:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A semi-structured program director interview: To obtain information about the Head Start&#xD;
           program's eligibility, recruitment, selection, enrollment, and attendance (ERSEA)&#xD;
           policies; RSER approaches and how they are tailored for families facing adversities;&#xD;
           staff training and support related to RSER and adversities; RSER approaches used with&#xD;
           underserved families; and partnerships that support the program's RSER efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A semi-structured Head Start ERSEA staff interview: To obtain information about the Head&#xD;
           Start program's ERSEA policies; RSER approaches and how they are tailored for families&#xD;
           facing adversities; staff training and support related to RSER and adversities; RSER&#xD;
           approaches used with underserved families; and partnerships that support the program's&#xD;
           RSER efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A semi-structured community partner staff interview: To collect information about the&#xD;
           community organization's experience working with the Head Start program and their&#xD;
           referral processes; the organization's understanding of Head Start eligibility criteria;&#xD;
           the organization's procedures for disseminating information about early education and&#xD;
           child care options to families; and the organization's view of the Head Start program's&#xD;
           role in meeting families' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A focus group with families enrolled in Head Start: To collect information on the&#xD;
           families' experience with the Head Start program; the recruitment and post-enrollment&#xD;
           experience in the Head Start program; and the likelihood of the family's continuing its&#xD;
           involvement in the Head Start program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A focus group with Head Start-eligible families not enrolled in Head Start: To obtain&#xD;
           information on the families' experience with the community partner organization;&#xD;
           knowledge of Head Start program and alternate early education and child care options;&#xD;
           barriers to enrollment in the Head Start program; and the reasons families choose&#xD;
           alternative child care.&#xD;
