  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADCY5-related movement disorders are caused by dominant mutations in the ADCY5 gene. This&#xD;
      rare neurogenetic disease is characterized by childhood-onset generalized hyperkinetic&#xD;
      movements. Currently, the only tools available to rate the severity of movement disorders&#xD;
      observed in ADCY5-patients are clinical rating scales of abnormal movements. These scales use&#xD;
      the investigators' judgement to rate globally the severity of movements observed in various&#xD;
      body parts of the patient. This protocol proposes to investigate a multimodal approach,&#xD;
      combining a clinical scale assessment with ViconTM's objective movement measurement. A&#xD;
      secondary objective of the study is to assess the effect of coffee on ADCY5-patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ADCY5-related movement disorders are caused by dominant mutations in the ADCY5 gene. This&#xD;
      rare neurogenetic disease is characterized by childhood-onset generalized hyperkinetic&#xD;
      movements. The abnormal movements typically comprise a combination of dystonia, myoclonus and&#xD;
      chorea occurring on a background of axial hypotonia, with superimposed disabling episodes of&#xD;
      paroxysmal dyskinesia. The causing mutations are located in the ADCY5 gene coding for the&#xD;
      Adenylate Cyclase 5 (AC5). AC5 is highly expressed in the striatal projection neurons of the&#xD;
      striatum, a region involved in the control of movements. No effective treatment has been&#xD;
      found. Currently, the only tools available to rate the severity of movement disorders&#xD;
      observed in ADCY5-patients are clinical rating scales of abnormal movements. These scales use&#xD;
      the investigators' judgement to globally rate movements severity in various body parts. This&#xD;
      leads to inter-raters' scoring variability. An objective assessment through refined and&#xD;
      comprehensive quantification of movements is needed. A motion capture system, such as&#xD;
      ViconTM, could better reflect the global and focal variations of abnormal movements. This&#xD;
      would be critical for the evaluation of responses to potential treatments. This protocol&#xD;
      proposes to investigate a multimodal approach, combining a clinical scale assessment with&#xD;
      ViconTM's objective movement measurement. A secondary objective of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of coffee on ADCY5-patients. The caffeine contained in coffee acts as a nonselective&#xD;
      adenosine receptor antagonist, with a strong affinity for A2A receptors. By blocking A2A&#xD;
      receptors, caffeine reduces the enzymatic activity of the altered mutated AC5 protein coded&#xD;
      by the mutated ADCY5 gene. This effect could modulate the abnormal movements observed in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
