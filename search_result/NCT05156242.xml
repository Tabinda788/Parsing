    <textblock>
      This study aims to 1) determine the immediate effects of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) on corticospinal excitability, lumbar multifidus muscle (LM) activation,&#xD;
      as well as lumbar stability in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP), 2) determine the&#xD;
      immediate effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on corticospinal&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study will use a sample of convenience between the ages of 18 and 40. Subjects&#xD;
      who has low back pain more than 3 months or a recurrent pattern of low back pain at least two&#xD;
      episodes that interfered with activities of daily living and/or required treatment will be&#xD;
      recruited by flyers posted in 2 university physical therapy clinics, as well as word of mouth&#xD;
      from subjects and friends. Subjects without a history of low back pain in lifetime will be&#xD;
      also recruited to establish normative data. Subjects who are interested in participation will&#xD;
      undergo a screening process using inclusion-exclusion criteria checklist and receive brief&#xD;
      information regarding the study. If they meet all inclusion criteria, the consent process&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will fill out the information sheet for demographic data. Subjects in CLBP will&#xD;
      undergo standardized movement system impairment examination and transverse abdominis muscle&#xD;
      thickness measurement, self-report questionnaires; pain, disability, quality of life, and&#xD;
      fear of movement) and functional tests (5-time sit to stand test, 2-minute step test,&#xD;
      functional reach test, prone trunk extension test and abdominal curl test). The project&#xD;
      manager responsible for organizing the data collection and blindness will arrange the&#xD;
      appointments with the subjects for 2 biomechanical data collection. For the subjects who&#xD;
      refuse to participate in biomechanical lab testing, they will proceed to 6-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first visit (pre-intervention visit#1), biomechanical data including motion and&#xD;
      clinical data, lumbar stability, and cortical excitability will be collected. The body&#xD;
      landmarks will be identified. These landmarks include 1) lumbar spinous process of T12-S2, 2)&#xD;
      lumbar erector spinae (ES) and multifidus (LM) (3 cm lateral to L3 spinous process and 2 cm&#xD;
      lateral to L3 spinous process, respectively), 3) bilateral lateral epicondyle of femur, and&#xD;
      4) bilateral lateral malleolus. Spinous process of L1, S2, bilateral lateral epicondyle of&#xD;
      femur, and bilateral lateral malleolus will be used as locations for motion tracking sensors,&#xD;
      while ES and LM location will be used to place surface electrode for cortical excitability&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For motion and clinical observation data collection, subjects will be instructed to perform&#xD;
      1) sustained positions including usual sitting, corrected position in sitting, usual&#xD;
      standing, corrected position in standing, as well as 2) functional movements including active&#xD;
      forward bend, stand to sit, sit to stand, walking for 30 seconds, stair ascending, stair&#xD;
      descending, and pick up a box from the floor. Then, the subjects will be asked to perform&#xD;
      clinical movement tests including active forward bend (waiter's bow), standing with posterior&#xD;
      tilt, single leg stance on left and right foot, single leg squat on left and right leg,&#xD;
      supine with right and left straight leg raise tests, supine with right and left hip abduction&#xD;
      with knee flexion tests, quadruped backward rock test, prone with right and left knee flexion&#xD;
      tests, prone with right and left hip internal/external rotation tests, prone with right and&#xD;
      left hip extension tests. 1-2 repetitions of practice trial will be provided to familiarize&#xD;
      with the movement. Each subject performs 2 sets of 3 consecutive repetitions of each&#xD;
      functional movement and clinical movement test in fixed order, while 2 assessors&#xD;
      independently rate presence/absence of aberrant movement. Thirty-second rest will be provided&#xD;
      between movement tests (rest period can be longer if necessary). Pain intensity, heart rate&#xD;
      and rating of perceive exertion (RPE) will be monitored after each test. Motion sensors will&#xD;
      be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, subjects will undergo lumbar stability test. Two electromagnetic tracking sensors&#xD;
      will be placed on T12 and S2 spinous processes, while one sensor will be attached to&#xD;
      hand-held dynamometer. Subjects will be asked to position in prone on the treatment bed with&#xD;
      both feet on the floor. A researcher will apply 10-kg compression force on L1 to L5 spinous&#xD;
      processes for 2 seconds. This 10-kg compression force is derived from the pilot work in which&#xD;
      the researchers plotted the graph between compression force in X-axis and posteroanterior&#xD;
      displacement in Y-axis. The graph demonstrated plateau (no displacement even increasing in&#xD;
      compression force) at approximately 10 kg. Then, subjects will be asked to lift both legs&#xD;
      away from the floor presumably activating LM, while the researcher re-apply the same&#xD;
      compression force on L1 to L5 again. Pain will be recorded when applying compression force on&#xD;
      each spinal level. Sensor displacement will be collected to represent lumbar stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cortical excitability measurement, the subjects will undergo corticospinal excitability&#xD;
      measurement using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The researcher will use ES and LM&#xD;
      landmarks for EMG electrode placement. Before placing surface EMG electrodes, the skin will&#xD;
      be lightly abraded using abrasive paper and cleaned using cotton with alcohol to lower the&#xD;
      skin impedance. Electrodes will be aligned parallel to the muscle fibers. Then, Subjects seat&#xD;
      comfortably in a reclined chair with both arms supported. They will be asked to wear a swim&#xD;
      cap used to identify stimulation areas for ES and LM. The researcher uses TMS with&#xD;
      single-pulse monophasic to stimulate each point over pre-marked scalp sites on a 5 X 7 grid&#xD;
      (0-5 cm lateral and from 5 cm anterior to 2 cm posterior to the vertex). Motor cortex&#xD;
      stimulation is conducted during submaximal muscle contractions (at 20% MVIC) via EMG visual&#xD;
      feedback. Five stimuli will be delivered at each point across the grid with 5-second interval&#xD;
      between stimuli and 1-minute rest after each point stimulation. Motor evoke potentials (MEPs)&#xD;
      will be recorded. These MEPs will be used to represent corticospinal excitability at&#xD;
      baseline. After completion of corticospinal excitability data collection. All electrodes will&#xD;
      be removed, and marks on the subject's skin will be erased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second visit (pre-intervention visit#2) will be scheduled 1-3 day apart from the first&#xD;
      visit (pre-intervention visit#1). Evidence demonstrates the retention of changes in cortical&#xD;
      excitability can last for 24 hours; thus, the second visit aims to wash out the effects of&#xD;
      TMS on corticospinal excitability from TMS measurement before receiving tDCS or NMES. LM&#xD;
      activation measurement at baseline will be collected. The subjects will be in prone position&#xD;
      on treatment table with thorax (T3 level) and pelvis (S2 level) securely fastened to the bed.&#xD;
      Then, ultrasound transducer will be placed at right L4-5 facet joint by the researcher who is&#xD;
      blinded to the group assignment. Right LM thickness at rest will be recorded. After that, the&#xD;
      subject will be asked to perform 2 repetitions of maximum voluntary isometric contraction&#xD;
      (MVIC) of back extension with rotation to the left to activate right LM with 1-minute rest&#xD;
      between repetitions. The researcher will measure right LM thickness during MVIC for both&#xD;
      repetitions. Subject will be asked to rate the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and take&#xD;
      5-minute rest to prevent muscle fatigue. The neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)&#xD;
      electrodes will be placed to bilateral LM, and the system will be set at interferential mode&#xD;
      (6000 Hz, beat frequency 20-50 Hz, scanning effect). Then, ultrasound transducer will be&#xD;
      placed at right L4-5 facet joint by the researcher. The NMES intensity will be set at maximal&#xD;
      tolerance to presumably activate most motor units available in the LM. The subject will be&#xD;
      asked to perform 2 repetitions of MVIC simultaneously with the NMES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After LM activation measurement, subjects will be randomly assigned into 3 groups (tDCS&#xD;
      priming with MCE group, NMES priming with MCE group, and MCE alone group). For the first&#xD;
      visit, we aim to determine the effects of tDCS and NMES against MCE. The subjects in tDCS&#xD;
      priming with MCE group will receive the tDCS using 5X7 cm electrodes in which anodal&#xD;
      electrode will be placed on M1 representing the back muscles (1 cm anterior and 4 cm lateral&#xD;
      to the vertex), while cathodal electrode will be placed on contralateral supraorbital area.&#xD;
      The intensity will be set at 2 mA with 10-second fade in/out. The subject will be stimulated&#xD;
      by tDCS for 20 minutes. The subjects in NMES priming with MCE group will receive the NMES&#xD;
      using interferential mode (6000 Hz, beat frequency 20-50 Hz, scanning effect) on bilateral&#xD;
      LM. The intensity will be set at the subject's maximum tolerance. Stimulation will be set at&#xD;
      10 seconds on and 60 seconds off to minimize muscle fatigue. The subjects in MCE group will&#xD;
      receive MCE for 20 minutes. After that, all subjects will undergo LM activation, lumbar&#xD;
      stability and cortical excitability measurements using the same protocol. These data will be&#xD;
      used to determine the immediate effects of tDCS and NMES against MCE (Objective 1 and 3). The&#xD;
      researcher will make an appointment with the subjects for 6-week intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6-week intervention program can start at any day based on the subject's preference but&#xD;
      should no longer than 1 week after baseline measurement. For 6-week intervention program, the&#xD;
      subjects in tDCS priming with MCE group will receive a 20-minute tDCS, while the subjects in&#xD;
      NMES priming with MCE group will receive a 20-minute NMES using the same setting as&#xD;
      previously mentioned, and the subjects in MCE alone group will receive a 20-minute sham tDCS&#xD;
      by setting the intensity at zero mA. After 20 minutes, the subject will receive MCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will receive tDCS, sham-tDCS or NMES for 20 minutes followed by 20-minute&#xD;
      supervised MCE for every session. The subject is encouraged to perform the same exercise as&#xD;
      physical therapy session for 15 minutes once a day and keep record in the exercise logbook.&#xD;
      The subject will receive assigned intervention twice a week for 6 weeks. The total number of&#xD;
      interventions is 12 sessions. To increase the generalizability of the study, the researchers&#xD;
      will not fix the day of the week. The subjects can select any days in the week that is&#xD;
      suitable for them. However, we keep twice a week as the evidence shows improvement in pain&#xD;
      and disability. Subjects will be asked to fill out pain and disability questionnaires, as&#xD;
      well as undergo functional tests at week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of 6-week intervention program, the subjects will undergo biomechanical data&#xD;
      collection including motion, clinical observation, LM activation, lumbar stability, and&#xD;
      cortical excitability. Clinical outcomes including pain, disability, quality of life, fear of&#xD;
      movement, global rating of change, as well as patient's satisfaction will be also collected.&#xD;
      Functional tests will be performed after 6-week intervention as well. Baseline and post&#xD;
      6-week data will be used to compare the effectiveness of 6-week intervention program among&#xD;
      tDCS priming with MCE, NMES priming with MCE, and MCE alone in patients with CLBP (Objective&#xD;
      3). In addition, corticospinal excitability, LM activation, lumbar stability, movement&#xD;
      patterns, and clinical outcomes will be used to determine the associations among parameters&#xD;
      (Objective 4).&#xD;
