  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, long-term follow-up study to assess the long-term safety and&#xD;
      durability of AVR-RD-04 treatment in participants who received a single dose administration&#xD;
      of lentiviral gene therapy. No investigational product will be administered in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will continue periodic safety and efficacy assessments in this long-term&#xD;
      follow-up study up to 15 years from the initial date of AVR-RD-04 infusion.&#xD;

      Participants enrolled in a study where the individual received AVR-RD-04 will be offered&#xD;
      participation in the AVRO-RD-04-LTF01 study. The Baseline visit for the AVRO-RD-04-LTF01&#xD;
      study will likely coincide with the final visit in the parent study. Participants confirmed&#xD;
      eligible for the AVRO-RD-04-LTF01 study will be asked to return for study visits at&#xD;
      approximately 6-month intervals for the first 4 years and annually thereafter for up to 11&#xD;
      years until a total of 15 years have elapsed during which time continued safety, engraftment,&#xD;
      and efficacy of AVR-RD-04 treatment will be assessed.&#xD;
