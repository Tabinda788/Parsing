      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Canadian women.&#xD;
      Treatment of BC is based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor&#xD;
      (PgR), and amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), in conjunction&#xD;
      with traditional clinical-pathological features such as tumor grade, size, and lymph node&#xD;
      status. Patients whose tumours lack ER, PgR and show no overexpression of HER2, collectively&#xD;
      termed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), account for 15-20% of all BC diagnoses. These&#xD;
      tumours do not respond to hormone therapy or HER2 targeted agents and are treated instead&#xD;
      with traditional chemotherapeutic agents, which are non-specific and are associated with&#xD;
      potentially significant toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alkylating agent Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral chemotherapy drug that damages DNA by&#xD;
      adding methyl groups to the O6- and N7- positions of guanine (O6-meG and N7-meG,&#xD;
      respectively) and the N3- position of adenine (N3-meA). 06-methylguanine-DNA&#xD;
      methyltransferase (MGMT) repairs O6- adducts caused by TMZ during DNA replication, resulting&#xD;
      in cell survival. MGMT expression is commonly decreased in cancer due to promoter methylation&#xD;
      (mMGMT), leading to enhanced TMZ-induced cell death. MGMT promoter methylation has been noted&#xD;
      in many human tumours, including BC. Intriguingly, prevalence of mMGMT has been shown to be&#xD;
      higher in TNBC relative to hormone receptor positive BCs. TMZ has been explored as a&#xD;
      potential treatment option for BC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In normal cells, the protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is involved in repairing the&#xD;
      N7-meG DNA lesions caused by TMZ to ensure cell survival. Although TMZ toxicity is&#xD;
      predominantly manifested by non-repair of the O6-meG adducts due to low/deficiency of MGMT,&#xD;
      inhibition of PARP using a PARPi, such as Olaparib, has been shown to enhance TMZ's&#xD;
      cytotoxicity. When PARP is unable to repair DNA damage, significant replication stress ensues&#xD;
      that ultimately causes formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can be repaired by&#xD;
      homologous recombination (HR) to promote cell survival. Critical to the HR repair process,&#xD;
      and cell survival in the absence of PARP, is a functional BRCA1 and BRCA2. In the absence of&#xD;
      these proteins, the DSBs caused by replication stress cannot be repaired, resulting in cell&#xD;
      death. Thus, individuals with germline mutations in BRCA1/2 genes (BRCA-positive) are&#xD;
      extremely sensitive to PARPi. Approximately 10% of TNBC patients carry a germline BRCA&#xD;
      mutation and therefore may be eligible for a PARP inhibitor such as olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, early phase trials (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01009788, NCT01618136, NCT01506609) have&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate TMZ in combination with a PARPi in BC. The early trials showed promising&#xD;
      results with Veliparib (PARPi) in combination with Temozolomide, with a 25% objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR), with a 50% clinical benefit rate (CBR) seen in BRCA-positive patients;&#xD;
      however, recent results from the BROCADE study (NCT01506609) found that Veliparib plus TMZ&#xD;
      was inferior to the other treatment arms evaluated but still showed a CBR of 73%, with 1&#xD;
      complete and 19 partial responses noted (22% of patients) in BRCA-positive. Importantly, this&#xD;
      trial did not evaluate mMGMT status in participants' tumour samples. Although not in BC, the&#xD;
      recent findings that Veliparib in combination to TMZ in glioblastomas found that Veliparib&#xD;
      significantly enhances the efficacy of TMZ in mMGMT tumours in patient-derived xenograft in&#xD;
      vivo models, have been incorporated into an ongoing phase II/III clinical trial&#xD;
      (NCT02152982), with the results still not being reported. Overall, the preclinical research&#xD;
      findings strongly suggest that TMZ and PARPi combination may benefit BC patients with mMGMT&#xD;
      tumours. Currently, there are no known clinical trials evaluating TMZ with the only&#xD;
      clinically approved PARPi's, Olaparib and Talazoparib, in BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized phase II study to evaluate DCR of patients with metastatic or locally&#xD;
      advanced mMGMT TNBC treated with TMZ ± Olaparib. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to Treatment&#xD;
      Arm 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Temozolomide (Day 1- 21 of 21-day cycles) Arm 2: Temozolomide (Day 1-7 of 21-day&#xD;
      cycles) plus olaparib (Day 1-7 of 21 day cycles) Duration of treatment: Until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent by patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: 5 years; the study will end when either all patients die, or 3 years have&#xD;
      passed since the last patient started study treatment, whichever comes first.&#xD;

             contraceptive method from the start of treatment until 6 months after treatment&#xD;
             discontinuation. A woman is considered to be of &quot;childbearing potential&quot; if she has&#xD;
             had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to routine&#xD;
             contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy&#xD;

             prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or vasectomy/vasectomized partner. However, if at any point a previously&#xD;
             celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for&#xD;
             use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for&#xD;
             beginning contraceptive measures.&#xD;

             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of radiographic and/or&#xD;
             clinical progression and the patient does not require ongoing use of corticosteroids.&#xD;
             Participants with known history of CNS involvement, should have a brain imaging&#xD;
             (CT/MRI) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;

             eligible for this trial, patients must be &gt;class 2B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy within 4 weeks or radiotherapy to a non-target&#xD;
             site within 2 weeks prior to entering the study or who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events from prior anti-cancer therapy (residual toxicities &gt; Grade 1) with the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents within 3 weeks of signing&#xD;
             the main informed consent form.&#xD;

             curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations/substance abuse that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
