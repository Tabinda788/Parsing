  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the management of chronic pain, it is very important to reaffirm the patient's self-worth&#xD;
      and ability through psychological support and spiritual care. The role of spiritual&#xD;
      consultant is to provide spiritual consultation and spiritual care, so that the medical team&#xD;
      can truly implement a whole-person care of the patient including the body, mind, and family.&#xD;
      Pain resilience of chronic pain patients' has been found to be a different construct from the&#xD;
      general resilience in the field of chronic diseases. Pain resilience emphasizes the&#xD;
      cognitive/emotional positivity and behavior persistence of pain patients' when facing pain.&#xD;
      So far, there has been no research on the theme of &quot;pain resilience and spiritual health&quot;.&#xD;
      Researchers have seen the necessity of care and assistance for patients with chronic low back&#xD;
      pain. Hence, this study would like to explore &quot;how pain resilience and spiritual health&#xD;
      affect the pain experience of patients with chronic low back pain &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives: 1. To understand how spiritual health and pain resilience interact to&#xD;
      influence the the pain experience in patients with chronic low back pain and 2. To understand&#xD;
      how spiritual health and pain resilience interact and influence they way how patients with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain cope with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This research plan will be implemented upon obtaining the approval from IRB. An&#xD;
      estimated 15 cases will be enrolled. Through in-depth interviews and collection of&#xD;
      observational data during interviews, the interviewer will record, transcribe and analyze the&#xD;
      narratives and experience descriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study can become an important basis for clinical care of patients with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain.&#xD;

      observational data during interviews, the interviewer will record, transcribe and analyze the&#xD;
      narratives and experience descriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A spiritual consultant and a psychologist will interview the participants about their&#xD;
      experiences of chronic low back pain, how they interpret their pain experience and how they&#xD;
      cope with the persistent pain. Each participant will be interviewed individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions related to the following three aspects will be asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Attributes: describe the changes in your personality, mood, and general happiness you&#xD;
           have observed after you starting having chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain resilience: How would you describe this persisting pain experience? How do you&#xD;
           arrange your daily activity? What do you do to deal with this persistent pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Spirituality: As a person with chronic low back pain, how do you interpret this pain&#xD;
           experience? Do you seek connections with higher powers (such as powers from religion)&#xD;
           when you are desperate because of pain? Since the pain is chronic and persistent, it&#xD;
           might not go away, how would you define your life?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of analysis: The current study will adopt interpretative phenomenological analysis to to&#xD;
      examine the pain experience of the participants. After data was collected through interview,&#xD;
      transcripts will be coded in detail. In the process of analyzing the text, the investigators&#xD;
      will categorize the text into themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study can become an important basis for clinical care of patients with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain.&#xD;
