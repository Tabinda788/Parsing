  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) describes a group of persistent disorders in movement and postural&#xD;
      development that cause activity limitation, attributed to non-progressive disturbances&#xD;
      occurring in the developing fetal or infant brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor disorders of cerebral palsy are often accompanied by sensory, perception, cognition,&#xD;
      communication and behavioral disorders due to epilepsy and secondary musculoskeletal&#xD;
      problems.(Rosenbaum et al. 2007) Within the ICF, body functions are the physiological&#xD;
      functions of body systems and anatomical parts of the body, such as body structures, organs,&#xD;
      limbs, and components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disorders are problems that appear as a significant deviation or loss in body functions or&#xD;
      structure. The primary injury in CP is a brain lesion resulting from an upper motor neuron&#xD;
      lesion that is thought to have a number of positive and negative features. Positive traits&#xD;
      include spasticity, hyperreflexia, and co-contraction, while negative traits include&#xD;
      weakness, loss of selective motor control, and balance and coordination deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the&#xD;
      Functional Mobility Scale (FMS) in individuals with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

      GROSS MOTOR FUNCTİON CLASSİFİCATİON SYSTEM (GMFCS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level I: Walks without restrictions. Level II: Walks with restrictions. Level III: Walks&#xD;
      using hand-held mobility devices. Level IV: Self-movement is limited. Can use a motorized&#xD;
      mobility vehicle. Level V: Transported in a manual wheelchair. Differences Between Levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences Between Levels I and II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to children/teens in Level I, children/teenagers in Level II have limitations in&#xD;
      walking and balance. They may need hand-held mobility devices when they first learn to walk.&#xD;
      They can use a wheeled mobility vehicle for long distance trips outside the home and in the&#xD;
      community. They need the use of handrails when going up and down stairs. He does not have the&#xD;
      ability to run and jump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences Between Levels II and III:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and teenagers at Level II can walk without a hand-held mobility device after age 4&#xD;
      (although they prefer to use it occasionally). Children and youth in Level III use hand-held&#xD;
      mobility devices to walk indoors and use wheeled mobility devices outside the home and in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences Between Level III and IV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and teenagers in Level III sit on their own or need very nervous external support to&#xD;
      sit, are more independent in standing displacements, and walk with a hand-held mobility&#xD;
      device. Children/teens at Level IV are functional seated (usually supported), but&#xD;
      self-mobility is limited. Children and young people in Level IV are mostly transported in a&#xD;
      manual wheelchair or use a motorized mobility vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences Between Levels IV and V:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and teenagers at Level V have severe limitations in bass and trunk control and need&#xD;
      extensive technological and physical assistance. Self-mobility is gained only when the&#xD;
      child/youth learns how to use a motorized wheelchair (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEDİATRİC EVALUATİON OF DİSABİLİTY INVENTORY (PEDI):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluates activities of daily living (self-care, mobility, social function) in children aged&#xD;
      between 6 months and 7.5 years. PEDI is a comprehensive clinical assessment tool that&#xD;
      assesses children's functional ability and performance. The first section, the Functional&#xD;
      Skills Section, consists of 197 items and is a direct measurement of the child's functional&#xD;
      abilities. In this section, the Self-Care subsection consists of 73 items, the Mobility&#xD;
      subsection 59 and the Social Functions subsection 65 items. The child is given points as&#xD;
      &quot;0=cannot&quot; and &quot;1=can&quot; for the items in this section. At the end of each subsection, the&#xD;
      scores of that section are summed up and the functional skills (FB) total score is obtained&#xD;
      by adding the scores of the subsections. The second and third sections evaluate the help and&#xD;
      form of assistance from caregivers. It occurs in self-care, mobility, and social function&#xD;
      items. Evaluation with the help of the caregiver is graded as independent, observation,&#xD;
      minimum, moderate, maximum, complete. Adaptation evaluation is examined in 4 categories as no&#xD;
      adaptation, adaptations for the child, rehabilitation tools and intensive adaptation. In this&#xD;
      study, the mobility section will be used (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABILOCO- KIDS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a valid and reliable locomotion abilities scale defined on 10 items. ABILOCO-KIDS,&#xD;
      which measures mobility, was translated into Turkish and applied. ABİLOCO-kids questionnaire&#xD;
      consisting of ten questions was filled according to the information given by the parents.&#xD;
      Questions are evaluated on a five-point scale. Impossible, difficult, easy, (unobserved&#xD;
      activity). It can be applied to children aged 5 and over. (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY SCALE (FMS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMS classifies functional mobility in children with CP by grading the ability to walk at&#xD;
      three specific distances, 5, 50, and 500 meters, according to the need for assistive devices.&#xD;
      The scale includes various assistive devices such as wheelchairs, walkers, crutches and&#xD;
      sticks, and also includes walking without the need for assistive devices. It uses a six-point&#xD;
      ordinal scale (1-6) to rate the assistance needed at each distance reflecting distances from&#xD;
      home, school, and community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 points, Independent on all surfaces. It does not use any walking aids or require the&#xD;
      assistance of another person when walking on all surfaces, including uneven floors.&#xD;
      (sidewalks etc. and in a crowded environment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 points, Independent on flat surfaces. Does not use walking aids or need someone else's&#xD;
      help. It needs handrails for stairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 points, uses a cane (one or two). Walks without the help of another person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 points uses crutches without someone else's help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 points use walker without anyone else's help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 point, Uses a wheelchair. Can stop for transfers, take a few steps assisted by another&#xD;
      person or using a walker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C = Crawling: Child crawls (5m) to be able to move around the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = not valid : For example, the child does not complete the distance ( 500 m ) .(1)&#xD;
