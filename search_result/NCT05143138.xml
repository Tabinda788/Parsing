  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, single-arm retrospective and prospective registry is being conducted to confirm&#xD;
      the clinical performance and safety of GORE® VIABAHN® VBX Balloon Expandable Endoprosthesis&#xD;
      when used as a Bridging Stent with Branched and Fenestrated Endografts in the Treatment of&#xD;
      Aortic Aneurysms Involving the Renal-Mesenteric Arteries.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 15 sites in Europe will be required to enroll a minimum of 220 patients that have had&#xD;
      treatment with GORE® VIABAHN® VBX Balloon Expandable Endoprosthesis when used as a Bridging&#xD;
      Stent with Branched and Fenestrated Endografts in the Treatment of Aortic Aneurysms Involving&#xD;
      the Renal-Mesenteric Arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry procedures consist of two phases, retrospective phase and prospective phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective phase consists only of the collection of retrospective data (baseline,&#xD;
      treatment and FU data) from the source documents available at the site from the time of the&#xD;
      treatment until the enrollment date (ICF signature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective phase consists in collection of follow-up visits from the enrollment up to 5&#xD;
      years. The FU data collected prospectively can change from subject to subject depending on&#xD;
      the index procedure date. Diagnostic imaging, treatment interventions, and follow up will be&#xD;
      determined by physicians based on clinical practice standards.&#xD;
