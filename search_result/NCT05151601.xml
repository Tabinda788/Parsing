  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project will investigate if a supplement containing a unique combination of&#xD;
      prebiotics and probiotics can influence behaviour in children diagnosed with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder. The study will use a combination of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs, prebiotics)&#xD;
      and probiotics as an oral powder.This clinical trial will have two consecutive phases. Phase&#xD;
      1A is an 8-week randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomised (1:1) to receive either the investigational product (treatment&#xD;
      group, n=30) or the placebo (control group, n=30). Phase 1B is an 8-week open-label study.&#xD;
      All participants that complete Phase 1A will move into Phase 1B (n=60). This allows all&#xD;
      participants to receive the investigational product and will provide additional information&#xD;
      on increased duration of treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be recruited into a two-phase project. Phase 1A: an 8-week double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised trial. Participants child will be randomised to one of groups 1) treatment (HMOs/Probiotic group) or 2) control group (placebo product).&#xD;
Phase 1B: is an 8-week open-label trial. All children who successfully complete phase 1A will be recruited into phase 1B. All participants in phase 1B will receive the treatment product (HMOs/probiotics).&#xD;
Follow up will occur at week 8 and week 17.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Changes in behavioural symptoms as measured by the Irritability sub-scale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community (Version 2) (I-ABC). The ABC 58-item parent-rated questionnaire and consists of five subscales, including: 1) irritability (15 items); 2) lethargy/social withdrawal (16 items); 3) stereotypic behaviour (7 items); 4) hyperactivity/noncompliance (16 items); and 5) inappropriate speech (4 items). Each item is scored as 0=never a problem, 1=slight problem, 2=moderately serious problem, or 3=severe problem. The score range is 0-174, with a higher score indicating greater severity or difficulties.</description>

    <description>Changes in behavioural symptoms as measured by the Home Situations Questionnaire - Autism Spectrum Disorder (HSQ-ASD). The HSQ-ASD is a 24-item, parent-rated measure of non compliant behaviour in children with ASD. The scale yields per-item mean scores of 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater noncompliance.</description>

    <measure>Behaviour Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-Phase 1A (week 8/9)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in parent/guardian targeted behaviours as measured by the Parent Targeted Symptom Visual Analogue Scale (PTSVAS). The PTSVAS tool requests parents/guardians report their top three (3) target behaviours (behaviours of concern) on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is a horizontal line of 100mm in length, with each end defined as the extreme limits of the behaviour of concern (&quot;best&quot; to &quot;worst&quot;), to be measured from left to right. The parents will score the behaviour by placing a mark on the VAS at baseline and post-intervention. Each mark will be measured on the scale of 0-100mm and the change from baseline to post-intervention noted.</description>

    <measure>Change in GI Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-Phase 1A (week 8/9)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in GI symptom severity as measured by the 6-item gastrointestinal severity index (6-GSI). The 6-GSI assesses each GI symptom using a Likert scale of 0-2 (0 = nil/mild/infrequent; 1 = moderate/occasional; 2 = severe/frequent). Score range 0-12. Mild GI issues are defined as a score of under three and moderate or severe GI issues defined as a score of three or above.</description>

The QoLA utilises a 5-point scale (0-4). Possible scores range from 48-240, with higher scores equating to higher perceived QoL.</description>
