      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequent illnesses in the world, affecting the knee&#xD;
      joint in particular. Osteoarthritis of the knee is the most common cause of physical&#xD;
      limitations and a decline in quality of life. OA of the knee affects 250 million individuals&#xD;
      worldwide (3.6 percent of the population). According to the World Health Organization's study&#xD;
      on the global burden of illness, knee OA is expected to become the eighth-most&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound is one of the most often utilized and misunderstood treatment techniques.&#xD;
      Ultrasound can help in the treatment or rehabilitation of musculoskeletal problems when&#xD;
      utilized appropriately. When it is administered wrongly, however, the therapy provides little&#xD;
      benefit at best, and at worst, the desired physiological effects are restricted or hindered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrotherapy is frequently used for the treatment of different musculoskeletal disorders,&#xD;
      The most common types of electrotherapy are ultrasound (US), iontophoresis, laser therapy,&#xD;
      electromagnetic therapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). To our&#xD;
      knowledge, no previous clinical trials have combined the effectiveness of PEMF and PUST in&#xD;
      the treatment of knee OA. Therefore, this study will be conducted to combine the efficacy of&#xD;
      PEMF and PUST in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

    <measure>Dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing the change in Dynamic balance using timed up and go test. It will be used to asses patients functional mobility. The patient will be asked to rise from a standard armchair, walk at a safe and comfortable pace to a mark 3 m away, then return to a sitting position in the chair, using gait aids and chair armrests to assist with sit to stand as needed.</description>

    <measure>Pain, Stiffness and function</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing the change in Pain, Stiffness and function using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). It consists of three subscales regarding pain, stiffness, and physical function with five, two, and 17 questions, respectively. Answers for these 24 questions are scored on five-point Likert scales (none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3, extreme = 4) with total scores ranging from 0 to 96. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity.</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing the change in Walking ability using the 10-meter walk test.which is reliable and valid test in patients with OA , measuring the required time for walking on a standard flat surface of 10 m.</description>
