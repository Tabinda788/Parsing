  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with Down Syndrome is&#xD;
      substantially increased. The risk of death is 3-10 fold higher than in healthy people.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been registered for adults and adolescents but none of them have&#xD;
      been studied in people with Down Syndrome. Vaccine responses in people with Down Syndrome are&#xD;
      known to be suboptimal. Therefor the objective of this study is to assess the immunogenicity&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people with Down syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, the antibody response, cellulair and mucosal immuneresponse in people with Down&#xD;
      syndrome after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination will be evaluated and compared to healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive two vaccinations against COVID-19 according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions as part of the Dutch SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program (GGD/RIVM).&#xD;
      To assess the immune response after vaccination, blood samples will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      (i.e. &lt;2 months prior to first vaccination (t=1)), 21-28 days after first vaccination and&#xD;
      prior to second vaccination (t=2), 28 days (3-6 weeks) (t=3) and 12 (+/- 1) months (t=4)&#xD;
      after the second vaccination. To evaluate haematological parameters, additional blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline, 21-28 days after the first vaccination and 28 days after the&#xD;
      second vaccination. Per visit/time-point maximum 60 ml blood will be drawn. In children the&#xD;
      maximum amount of blood taken per visit/time-point will be 0,8 ml/kg up to 60 ml. In addition&#xD;
      Mucosal Lining Fluid (MLF) samples will be collected at 28 days (3-6 weeks) (t=3) and 12 (+/-&#xD;
      1) months (t=4) after the second vaccination to evaluate the mucosal immune response after&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In the pediatric part of the study Mucosal Lining Fluid (MLF) samples&#xD;
      will be collected at all timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although vaccine administration is not part of this study, vaccine type, batch number and&#xD;
      dosing will be registered. This information will be obtained from the &quot;COVID-vaccination&#xD;
      information and monitoring system (CIMS)&quot; of the RIVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical course including the occurrence of COVID-19 will be monitored during the first year&#xD;
      after vaccination. To evaluate vaccination related AEs, patients will be asked to collect&#xD;
      solicited local and systemic AEs for 7 days after each vaccination using an online&#xD;
      questionnaire, as vaccination related AEs are mainly expected in the first week after&#xD;
      vaccination. The link to the online questionnaires will be sent to the emailaddress of the&#xD;
      participants and/or their representative/carer. If the participants and/or their&#xD;
      representative/carers are not able to fill out the diary online, they will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this study is not powered to detect differences in protection against COVID-19&#xD;
      between patients and controls, information on incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, outcome of&#xD;
      COVID-19 will be collected up to 12 months after vaccination for descriptive purposes.&#xD;
