      This study will compare the motor outcomes for five infants with asymmetrical hand function&#xD;
      (AHF) who will receive two, three week episodes of standard care separated by a three week&#xD;
      episode of mCIMT paired with Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation. The results of this study&#xD;
      will inform decisions on the feasibility and efficacy of the treatment for use in a larger&#xD;
      study for infants with AHF at risk for unilateral cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with asymmetrical hand function will participate in three consecutive phases of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first and third phase will consist of three weeks of standard care for children with&#xD;
      asymmetrical hand function, 1 hour/day, 1 day/week. The therapist will provide weekly&#xD;
      coaching with the parents so they can carry over activities at home one hour/day, six&#xD;
      days/week during this phase. In addition, a sock or mitten will be used for short term&#xD;
      constraint during the hour of training both in the clinic with the therapist and at home with&#xD;
      the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase will consist of three weeks of modified constraint induced movement therapy,&#xD;
      2 hours/day, 3 days/week paired with NMES, 15 minutes/day, 3 days/week. The infants will wear&#xD;
      a soft splint on their preferred hand and forearm 24 hours/day during this phase. Parents&#xD;
      will be trained by the therapist to carry over activities with their child at home, 1&#xD;
      hour/day, 6 days/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will return at chronological age of 18 months for follow up testing.&#xD;
