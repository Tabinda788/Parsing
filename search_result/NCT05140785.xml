  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regions of tumour whose cells (the building blocks of the tumour) are actively multiplying&#xD;
      generate a particular type of molecular footprint (consisting of various types of proteins)&#xD;
      compared to tumours whose cells are relatively stable. In addition, tumour cells begin to&#xD;
      develop a network of blood vessels that not only supply them with nutrients and oxygen, but&#xD;
      also provide a pathway for tumour spread. There is a critical period between when these&#xD;
      proteins and blood vessel network develops, and when tumour growth is visible using current&#xD;
      MRI scanning. Therefore, making the process of tumour activity visible on clinical MRI scans&#xD;
      is an important step in demonstrating and anticipating tumour growth. The study aims to do&#xD;
      this by utilising various novel and non-invasive MRI techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a collaboration between research groups at King's College London (UK) and the&#xD;
      Erasmus University Rotterdam (The Netherlands). The novel MRI techniques will be incorporated&#xD;
      into the pre-surgical imaging protocol of patients with primary brain tumours. The images&#xD;
      will be compared with molecular measurements made from biopsies taken during surgery to show&#xD;
      that they accurately map where activity is high and low within the tumour.&#xD;

      Patients recruited into this study will be those for whom a surgical resection or biopsy of a&#xD;
      primary brain tumour has already been planned by the King's College Hospital Neuro-oncology&#xD;
      team. All patients in the UK arm of this international study will be recruited at the King's&#xD;
      College Hospital site. Research imaging performed on patients enrolled in this study will&#xD;
      take place at the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have consented to be included in our research study, novel MRI techniques&#xD;
      will be included in addition to the standard primary brain tumour imaging protocol, to&#xD;
      provide additional information about the nature of the primary tumour: for example, the&#xD;
      structural components and metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scan will last approximately 60 minutes, which is approximately 30 minutes longer&#xD;
      than the standard brain tumour biopsy protocol. Further MRI scans will be performed after&#xD;
      surgery and, if necessary, at recurrence (up to a maximum of three scans per patient) to look&#xD;
      at advanced imaging changes at each time-point alongside structural changes. These additional&#xD;
      scans should also last a maximum of 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo surgery for biopsy/resection of the tumour as part of the standard&#xD;
      of care. All routine surgical procedures, pre-surgical and post-surgical care will take place&#xD;
      predominantly at King's College Hospital site. Before craniotomy takes place for tumour&#xD;
      resection, the neurosurgeon will take 3 tissue samples of the tumour. This will occur via&#xD;
      stereotactic (computer-guided) biopsies. A needle will be guided through to a location of&#xD;
      interest determined by the novel MRI techniques. This should result in an extension of the&#xD;
      surgery time of approximately 30 minutes (10 minutes per biopsy), in addition to the&#xD;
      approximately 4 hours needed for the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After removal, each biopsy specimen is put into a suitable container for preservation. The&#xD;
      container will be de-identified and shipped to the Department of Pathology, Erasmus&#xD;
      University Rotterdam, The Netherlands where the specimen will be securely stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be cut and slide-mounted for staining. When looking at the specimen under a&#xD;
      microscope, particular features which suggest how aggressive the tumour is will be looked&#xD;
      for. Information gathered from the tissue biopsies will then be compared and matched to&#xD;
      information on the original MRI scan to see whether the novel images obtained can accurately&#xD;
      predict the aggressiveness of different parts of the tumour.&#xD;
