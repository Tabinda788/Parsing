    <textblock>
      This study will explore the effect of mutation severity on exercise capacity. Through a&#xD;
      better understanding of the association between mutation severity and exercise capacity,&#xD;
      clinicians will be more able to predict a given patient's level of independent functioning&#xD;
      based on their genes, which is essential information that patients' families want to know&#xD;
      upon diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that disrupts the lungs. With an average survival of 40.7&#xD;
      years, this condition affects around 30,000 in the US. Most commonly seen in among those of&#xD;
      European descent, CF is present in about 1 in every 2,500 Caucasian newborns. A genetic&#xD;
      mutation causes a thick and sticky mucus production in the lungs. Thus, CF patients are more&#xD;
      likely to have respiratory failure and lung infections. These symptoms of CF vary among&#xD;
      patients and primarily depend on the severity of the gene mutations.Currently, there is not a&#xD;
      lot of literature on the relationship between CFTR genes and exercise capacity, highlighting&#xD;
      the relevance of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to last at least 10 weeks. Participants will be given a Fitbit tracker&#xD;
      at the beginning of the study to wear during their participation. Participants are asked to&#xD;
      engage in their normal level of physical activity. No one from the research team will have&#xD;
      direct access to their Fitbit information. In other words, participants will create an&#xD;
      account on the Fitbit website and only participants will be able to see the information on&#xD;
      there. A weekly survey about their Fitbit mileage will be given by a research member via&#xD;
      phone. The weekly survey will also ask more opinionated questions, regarding any updates on&#xD;
      their attitudes toward exercise. At the conclusion of this 10-week study, participants will&#xD;
      have the option of keeping their Fitbit tracker. About 50 participants are expected to enroll&#xD;
      in this study. At any point of the study, participants will be given the freedom to withdraw&#xD;
      their participation.&#xD;
