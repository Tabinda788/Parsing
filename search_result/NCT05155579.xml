    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib trial conducted in Bougouni, Mali to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of R21/Matrix-M in a single and two vial presentation, with different&#xD;
      immunisation schedules, and when co-administered with EPI vaccines in African children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial has six groups. This will be a double-blind, individually randomised trial, with&#xD;
      1:1 randomisation with the single or two vial presentation of R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine&#xD;
      for study groups 1, 2 and 3. Groups 1, 2 and 3 are to assess the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      R21/Matrix-M as a single vial formulation compared with a two-vial formulation, in children&#xD;
      aged 5- 36 months, in a malaria endemic area. The age range of 5-36 months has been split&#xD;
      into three groups to ensure an even age spread across age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For groups 4 and 5, this is a randomised, open-label study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of R21/Matrix-M when co-administrated with various EPI vaccines at the&#xD;
      relevant ages, in a malaria endemic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 6 is a randomised, open-label study to assess safety and immunogenicity of a delayed,&#xD;
      third dose of R21/Matrix-M in 5-36 month old children, in a malaria endemic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For groups 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, participants will be randomised 1:1. For group 4, participants&#xD;
      will be randomised 3:3:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 590 children will be recruited across these six study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of R21/Matrix-M, as a single- vial formulation&#xD;
           in 5-36-month old African children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of co-administration of R21/Matrix-M with the&#xD;
           EPI vaccines given at 9 months, measles-rubella and yellow fever vaccines, in African&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of co-administration of R21/Matrix-M with the&#xD;
           EPI vaccines given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, pentavalent and oral polio vaccine&#xD;
           (OPV), in African children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of R21/Matrix-M, as a single- vial formulation in&#xD;
           5-36-month-old African children, compared with the two-vial formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of EPI vaccines given at 9 months, measles-rubella and&#xD;
           yellow fever vaccines, when given with and without R21/Matrix-M&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of EPI vaccines given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age,&#xD;
           pentavalent and oral polio vaccines, given as part of EPI at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age,&#xD;
           when given with and without R21/Matrix-M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of R21/Matrix-M, as a single- vial formulation&#xD;
           in African children compared with the two-vial formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a delayed third dose of R21/Matrix-M in&#xD;
           5-36-month-old African children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of a delayed third dose of R21/Matrix-M in 5-36-month-old&#xD;
           African children.&#xD;

    <masking_description>For groups 1, 2 and 3, participants and investigators will be blinded to group allocation. Study staff involved in storage and preparation of the vaccine will be aware of vaccine assignment but these staff will play no other role in the study. The Sponsor team will remain blinded with the exception of designated members of the laboratory team that will perform the final evaluation of the data. For groups 4 and 5, no study staff or participants will be blinded as the number of vaccinations in each group is different. For group 6, no study staff or participants will be blinded as the schedule of vaccinations in each group is different.</masking_description>
