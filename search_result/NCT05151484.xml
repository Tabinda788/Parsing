  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis affects 24.5% of women over 65 and results in fracture-related hospital&#xD;
      admissions exceeding those of heart attacks, strokes and breast cancer combined. Current&#xD;
      treatment options do not account for differences between age-related and estrogen deficiency&#xD;
      related osteoporosis, because of the need for bone biopsies for determination. This study&#xD;
      will establish a paradigm-shifting individualized treatment protocol for age-related&#xD;
      osteoporosis and a non-invasive method for its determination, thereby reducing the major&#xD;
      health problems and enormous burden on society and the elderly related to this disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a health problem of major proportions. It affects more than 40 million&#xD;
      Americans and results in more than 2 million fractures annually among Medicare patients&#xD;
      alone. Hospital admissions for osteoporotic fractures exceed those of heart attacks, strokes&#xD;
      and breast cancer combined. Osteoporosis is commonly considered a disease associated with&#xD;
      menopause. This estrogen deficiency related bone loss is characterized by high bone turnover&#xD;
      with increased resorption without commensurate changes in bone formation. It is in contrast&#xD;
      to age-related bone loss, which starts as early as in the fourth decade of life and continues&#xD;
      with increasing age. Age-related bone loss is usually associated with lower bone turnover and&#xD;
      decreased bone formation is the main abnormality. Current therapies do not address&#xD;
      age-related bone loss and the special needs of the age-related osteoporosis population is&#xD;
      currently ignored. This is to a great degree due to difficulties associated with the bone&#xD;
      biopsy necessary for determination of bone turnover status. Thus, the current standard of&#xD;
      care relies on starting with an antiresorber, which is less effective in age-related&#xD;
      osteoporosis, and in fact impedes the effectiveness in this population of the appropriate&#xD;
      anabolic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study seeks to achieve two specific aims: Aim 1) to establish a novel&#xD;
      precision medicine approach to treatment of age-related osteoporosis based on recognition of&#xD;
      low bone turnover and initial treatment with anabolics, and Aim 2) to find a non-invasive&#xD;
      method for diagnosing low bone turnover in osteoporotic patients by measurements of serum&#xD;
      carboxylated osteocalcin with validation via the &quot;gold standard&quot; bone biopsy and&#xD;
      histomorphometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators approach will be to enroll female participants who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      osteoporosis in a prospective, proof of concept study. Patients will undergo bone biopsy and&#xD;
      blood draws at baseline. Bone turnover status will be assessed employing histomorphometry. In&#xD;
      addition, blood levels of carboxylated osteocalcin will be measured in order to determine&#xD;
      their validity - alone or in combination with other bone markers - for diagnosing low bone&#xD;
      turnover prevailing in age-related bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be grouped according to turnover status. Low-turnover participants will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1) either to treatment with the anabolic teriparatide (Group 1) or with the&#xD;
      standard of care antiresorber alendronate (Group 2) for one year. In order to provide the&#xD;
      necessary comparison group for the non-invasive assessment of turnover, normal-high turnover&#xD;
      participants (Group 3) will be treated with standard of care alendronate for one year. At&#xD;
      baseline and at one-year bone mineral density measurements will be performed by DXA and&#xD;
      1-year changes in BMD will be compared between groups. The investigators central hypothesis&#xD;
      is that low turnover, age-related osteoporosis needs to be diagnosed and treated differently&#xD;
      from estrogen deficiency related osteoporosis. The results will provide a paradigm shift in&#xD;
      the treatment of osteoporosis.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive 20 μg teriparatide per day via subcutaneous injections. Participants, and if needed a caregiver, will be trained in the subcutaneous administration of teriparatide according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The investigators will measure serum calcium, BSAP and TRAP-5b levels via blood draws at quarterly monitoring visits. If BSAP or TRAP-5b do not increase compared to baseline or decrease after any quarter, participants will be contacted and correct administration will be reviewed. Serum calcium is measured for safety to avoid hypo- and hypercalcemia. Participants will also be given a daily dose of Vitamin D of 800 IUs to prevent development of Vitamin D deficiency.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 70 mg alendronate p.o. once per week. Participants will be carefully instructed to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for administration. Compliance will be assessed by measurement of the bone turnover markers BSAP and TRAP-5b from blood drawn at quarterly monitoring visits. These markers have been shown to be useful for assessment of turnover changes with treatment. If these markers do not decrease compared to baseline or rise after any quarter, participants will be contacted and correct administration will be reviewed. Participants will also be given a daily dose of Vitamin D of 800 IUs to prevent development of Vitamin D deficiency.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosed Osteoporosis by DXA (BMD t-score ≤ -2.5 with or without fragility&#xD;
             fractures);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥ 40 years;&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients diagnosed as osteoporotic due to the presence of fragility fractures, but without&#xD;
        osteoporotic t-scores, will not be included because they would require fractures as a study&#xD;
        endpoint which would entail a multi-center approach. Moreover, abnormal bone quality has&#xD;
        been shown to be present in these patients, which requires bone histology for assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Malignancy within the prior 5 years metastatic to bone or requiring chemotherapy&#xD;
             (except non-melanoma skin cancers or cervical carcinoma in situ);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Metabolic bone diseases (including osteomalacia, primary hyperparathyroidism and other&#xD;
             hypercalcemic disorders, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Paget's disease, etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Endocrinopathy (e.g., current hyperthyroidism, untreated hypothyroidism, Cushing's&#xD;
             syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other medical diseases (e.g., eating disorders, end stage liver, heart or lung&#xD;
             disease, intestinal malabsorption, chronic kidney disease stages 2-5D);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any use of antiresorbers (e.g., alendronate, actonel, denosumab) or use within the&#xD;
             last two years of anabolic agents (e.g., teriparatide, abaloparatide);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use within the prior year of glucocorticoids, hormone replacement therapy, calcitonin,&#xD;
             selective estrogen receptor modulators or phenytoin;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy, desire to get pregnant, or nursing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Allergy to tetracycline;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. prior external beam or implant radiation therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. use of non-aspirin anticoagulants that cannot be safely stopped for the biopsy;&#xD;
