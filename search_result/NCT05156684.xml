    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of co-administration of Pentoxifylline and&#xD;
      Zinc sulfate on oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, sperm capacitation and&#xD;
      parameters in infertile men.&#xD;

      Design: Clinical trial with placebo-control group, parallel groups, double-blind, randomized&#xD;
      Settings and conduct This study will perform on infertile men referred to shafa infertility&#xD;
      treatment center in shafa hospital ( in khorramabad city). In this study Both participants&#xD;
      and researchers or evaluators of the outcome are unaware of the allocation of study groups.&#xD;
      Participants/Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: Infertile men referred to&#xD;
      the infertility treatment center who, have had at least one year of unprotected intercourse,&#xD;
      Natural fertility has not happened in their spouse. These men will all be married These men&#xD;
      will be between the ages of 20 and 50. According to WHO criteria, Sperm parameters&#xD;
      abnormalities should be observed in at least two spermogram within 2 weeks. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria: Single men Men with varicocele or any other specific disease Men who have taken a&#xD;
      particular drug for the past three months. .1. Control group: participants take placebo for 3&#xD;
      months. 2.participants take pentoxiphylline (400 mg/day) for 3 months. 3. participants take&#xD;
      zinc (zinc sulfate) (220 mg/day) for 3 months. 4. participants take pentoxiphylline (400 mg&#xD;
      daily) and Zinc (Zinc sulfate) (220 mg daily) for 3 months.Semen analysis and sperm&#xD;
      parameters (Spermogram;). Levels of LH, FSH and Testosterone; Malondialdehyde Level; TNF-α&#xD;
      and Interleukin 10; DNA Fragmentation; Sperm viability; Total antioxidant level of semen;&#xD;
      Expression of Caspase 3, BAX, BCL2 genes; Caspase-3, BAX, BCL2 proteins; Sperm maturation;&#xD;
      Evaluation of sperm capacitation All of the aforementioned analyzes measure in two stages&#xD;
      before and after the study.&#xD;
