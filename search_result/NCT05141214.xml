  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a national crisis, effecting up to 1 in 5 of children in the US. In the&#xD;
      Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Pediatric Weight Management Clinic, we educate parents and&#xD;
      caregivers about the importance of dietary modification. In addition to physician guidance,&#xD;
      we partner with registered dieticians to counsel families during an hour-long interview.&#xD;
      However, traditional methods of education are limited by long-term recall. A typical person&#xD;
      only recalls 2- 3% of didactic content after a period of 30 days.In order to improve recall&#xD;
      and increase involvement of our pediatric patients in their own dietary modifications, we&#xD;
      propose a feasibility study investigating the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) in&#xD;
      changing dietary choices and improving recall.&#xD;

    <measure>Short-term behavior modification</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of appointment, typically 2-3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Short-term behavior modification will be assessed by comparing the selection of an appointment exit reward. Participants will be presented with two options, a sticker and a piece of candy. Selection of reward will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of appointment, typically 2-3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>After their appointment, participants will be asked to complete a 10-item questionnaire that reviews the key learning objectives from their appointment. At their followup visit, they will be re-examined at the start of their appointment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of appointment, typically 2-3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete a 5-item satisfaction survey related to their educational experience. Each item will have a scale of 1-5 with anchors, probing participants' engagement with the learning material.</description>

    <description>Those in the VR group will receive the same educational dietary review by the registered dietician, and additionally participate in a VR experience through an application called Chaos Café. In Chaos Café, patients are immersed into a computer-generated kitchen environment. A humorous robotic chef serves children different food groups. Gameplay is advanced by choosing healthy foods, while eating unhealthy foods does not advance the application.</description>
