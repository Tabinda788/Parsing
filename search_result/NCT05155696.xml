  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised, placebo controlled trial explores the effects of supplementation with a&#xD;
      probiotic drink (kefir) in children diagnosed with ADHD on behaviour, sleep, attention and&#xD;
      the gut microbiome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can suffer debilitating&#xD;
      symptoms, including problematic behaviour and sleep. Dietary manipulations may be a helpful&#xD;
      treatment option for children, but the most effective are highly restrictive, with little&#xD;
      known about why they might work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimising gut bacteria may help alleviate some of the symptoms of this condition via the&#xD;
      gut-brain-axis. The consumption of a probiotic fermented drink (kefir) can positively&#xD;
      influence composition of gut bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of supplementation of a probiotic drink&#xD;
      (kefir) on behaviour, sleep, attention and the gut microbiome in children diagnosed with&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a six-week randomised controlled double-blind, placebo controlled trial, 70 children&#xD;
      diagnosed with ADHD (aged 8-13 years) will be randomised to be given either a probiotic drink&#xD;
      (kefir) or a placebo drink. At the beginning and the end of the study a combination of&#xD;
      questionnaires, cognitive assessment, sleep/physical activity measures and microbiome&#xD;
      analysis will be employed to assess the effect of kefir consumption on symptoms of ADHD and&#xD;
      the gut microbiome.&#xD;
