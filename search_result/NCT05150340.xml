  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to check how much TAK-771 stays in their blood over time, side&#xD;
      effect from the study treatment or TAK-771, how much TAK-771 participants can receive without&#xD;
      getting side effects from it, and if TAK-771 improves symptoms of primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
      diseases (PID). This will help the study sponsor (Takeda) to work out the best dose to give&#xD;
      people in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be treated with TAK-771 for totally 27 or 30 weeks. Treatment period is&#xD;
      consist of two periods called Epoch 1 and Epoch 2. In Epoch 1, different groups of&#xD;
      participants will receive lower to higher doses of TAK-771 for 3 to 6 weeks. The study&#xD;
      doctors will check for side effects from each dose of TAK-771. In Epoch 2, participants will&#xD;
      receive TAK-771 once a 3 or 4 weeks until the end of 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be many clinic visits. The number of visits will depend on the infusion cycles of&#xD;
      study drug (every 3, or 4 weeks).&#xD;

    <description>The PEDS-QL is a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population. It captures the following domains: general health/activities, feelings/emotional, social functioning, school functioning. In this study, 2-7 years (parent as observer), 8-13 years (participant as observer) for PEDS-QL health questionnaire will be analyzed. Higher scores indicate better quality of life (QOL) for all domains of the PEDS-QL. This modular instrument uses a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Four dimensions (physical, emotional, social, &amp; school functioning) are scored.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 is a generic quality-of-life instrument that has been widely used to assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) of participants. In this study, 14 years and older (participant as observer) for SF-36 health questionnaire will be analyzed. Generic instruments are used in general populations to assess a wide range of domains applicable to a variety of health states, conditions, and diseases. The SF-36 consists of 36 items that are aggregated into 8 multi-item scales (physical functioning, role - physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role - emotional, and mental health), with scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better HR QoL.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-3L health questionnaire is a participant answered questionnaire scoring 5 dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. In this study, 2-11 years (parent as observer),12 years and older (participant as observer) for EQ-5D-3L health questionnaire will be analyzed. The EQ-5D-3L total score ranges from 0 (worst health state) to 1 (perfect health state) and 1 reflects the best outcome.</description>

    <description>The LQI is a self-administered questionnaire developed specifically for participants/legal guardians involved in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatments. In this study, 2-13 years (parent as observer), 14 years and older (participant as observer) for LQI health questionnaire will be analyzed. LQI consists of 15-items, divided into four domains: treatment interferences (6 items), therapy-related problems (4 items), therapy setting (3 items), and treatment costs (2 items). Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1: &quot;Extremely bad&quot; to 7: &quot;Extremely good&quot;. Total scores range from 15 to 105, with higher scores indicating the highest possible satisfaction with factors such as independence, therapy convenience, social/school/work activities, and health and travel costs.</description>

    <description>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) is a global satisfaction scale used to assess the overall level of participant's satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their medications. In this study, 2-12 years (parent as observer), 13 years and older (participant as observer) for TSQM health questionnaire will be analyzed. TSQM-9 is a 9-item, validated, self-administered instrument used to assess participant's satisfaction with medication. The three domains assessed are effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. The score of each of the 3 domains is based on an algorithm to create a score of 0 to 100. Higher score indicated greater satisfaction in that domain.</description>

    <description>Treatment preference questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess participants' preference towards the administration of new subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) therapy. There are 4-items on the questionnaire, which investigate a participant's preference on the clinic/hospital/home setting of receiving the immunoglobulin therapy, the participant's rating on the frequency and method of administration, and the participant's preference to continue receiving the IGSC treatment.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Abnormal laboratory values at screening/enrollment meeting any one of the following&#xD;
             criteria (abnormal tests may be repeated once to determine if they are persistent):&#xD;
&#xD;

                  &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the testing laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Persistent severe neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC]&#xD;
                  =&lt;500/mm^3)&#xD;
&#xD;

             treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;

             episodes (including deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular&#xD;
             accident, pulmonary embolism) within 12 months prior to screening/enrollment or a&#xD;
             history of thrombophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant has abnormal protein loss (protein losing enteropathy, nephrotic syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant has anemia that would preclude phlebotomy for laboratory studies according&#xD;
             to standard practice at the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participant has an ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions&#xD;
             (urticaria, breathing difficulty, severe hypotension, or anaphylaxis) following IVIG,&#xD;
             subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG), and/or Immune Serum Globulin infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participant has immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (IgA less than 0.07g/L), known&#xD;
             anti-IgA antibodies, and a history of hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participant is on preventative (prophylactic) systemic antibacterial antibiotics at&#xD;
             doses sufficient to treat or prevent bacterial infections, and cannot stop these&#xD;
             antibiotics at the time of screening/enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participant has active infection and is receiving antibiotic therapy for the treatment&#xD;
             of infection at the time of screening/enrollment or had a serious bacterial infection&#xD;
             within the 3 months prior to screening/enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participant has a bleeding disorder, or a platelet count less than 20,000/microL, or&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, would be at significant risk of increased bleeding&#xD;
             or bruising as a result of subcutaneous (SC) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Participant has total protein &gt;9 g/dL or myeloma, or macroglobulinemia (IgM) or&#xD;
             paraproteinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Participant has a known allergy to hyaluronidase&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participant has severe dermatitis that would preclude adequate sites for safe product&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
