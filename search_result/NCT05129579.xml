      Purpose: This study aims to determine the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction&#xD;
      programs on the psychological resilience and well-being of intensive care nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study was planned as an experimental study with a randomized control group, using&#xD;
      pre-test, post-test and follow-up test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: H1: The resilience level scores of the nurses in the intervention group&#xD;
      participating in the mindfulness-based stress reduction initiative will increase compared to&#xD;
      the nurses in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Nurses in the intervention group participating in the mindfulness-based stress reduction&#xD;
      initiative will increase their well-being level scores compared to the nurses in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: The psychological resilience level posttest and follow-up scores of the nurses in the&#xD;
      intervention group participating in the mindfulness-based stress reduction initiative will&#xD;
      increase compared to their pretest scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: The well-being level posttest and follow-up scores of the nurses in the intervention&#xD;
      group participating in the mindfulness-based stress reduction initiative will increase&#xD;
      according to their pretest scores.&#xD;

    <description>Psychological Resilience Scale for Adults: The scale consists of 33 items; it includes 6 sub-dimensions: The structural style (3,9,15,21) and perception of future (2,8,14,20) subdimensions were measured by 4 items each, the family cohesion (5,11,17,23,26,32), perception of self (1,7,13,19,28,31,), and social competence (4,10,16,22,25,29) sub-dimensions were measured by 6 items each, and the social resources (6,12,18,24,27,30,33) sub-dimension was measured by 7 items. The score that can be obtained from the scale varies from 33 to 165.</description>

    <description>Psychological Well-Being Scale: The items of the scale are answered between 1 and 7, as I strongly disagree (1) and I strongly agree (7). All items are expressed positively. Scores range from 8 (strongly disagree to all items) to 56 (strongly agree to all items). A high score indicates that the person has many psychological resources and strengths.</description>
