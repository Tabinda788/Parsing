  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study B7841007 is an open-label extension study to assess the long-term safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and efficacy of prophylaxis treatment with marstacimab in participants who did not require&#xD;
      &quot;Early Termination&quot; from the Phase 3 Study B7841005. Approximately 145 adolescent and adult&#xD;
      participants 12 to &lt;75 years of age with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe&#xD;
      hemophilia B (defined as FVIII activity &lt;1% or FIX activity ≤2%, respectively) with or&#xD;
      without inhibitors are expected to be enrolled in this study during which they will receive&#xD;
      prophylaxis (defined as treatment by SC injection of marstacimab). The dosing regimen of&#xD;
      marstacimab is 150 mg SC once weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be provided the PFP for administration of marstacimab in the study. Use&#xD;
      of the PFS will be permitted at the investigator's discretion for those participants who have&#xD;
      difficulty with administration of the PFP. Additionally, participants will be provided the&#xD;
      PFS for use in this study in countries where the PFS is anticipated to be the only&#xD;
      presentation available commercially. In addition, an optional, open-label, single arm,&#xD;
      substudy using the PFP will be administered to the first approximately 20 participants&#xD;
      rolling over from Study B7841005 who agree to participate in the substudy.&#xD;
