  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis is a major healthcare problem with a reported incidence of 1-2% in all&#xD;
      hospitalizations. It is a major cause of death in the intensive care units worldwide and is&#xD;
      the second leading cause of death in noncoronary intensive care unit patients. Mortality&#xD;
      remains high at 30-50% despite a better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and improved&#xD;
      advanced care in the past decade .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation and analgesia in the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with sepsis and tenuous&#xD;
      hemodynamics can be challenging. Opioids and benzodiazepines can contribute to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of shock by exacerbating poor tissue perfusion through reduced cardiac&#xD;
      contractility, and increased vasodilation as well as reducing the respiratory drive .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation and analgesia management are both integral components of care in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU). Although benzodiazepines have been the mainstay therapy for sedation in&#xD;
      critically ill patients, their use has declined in recent years, with favoring of&#xD;
      nonbenzodiazepines,such as propofol and dexmedetomidine .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A noticeable interest in ketamine infusion for sedation management in critically ill patients&#xD;
      has developed among critical care physicians . The 2018 Pain, Agitation/ sedation, Delirium,&#xD;
      Immobility, and Sleep disruption (PADIS) guideline suggested low-dose ketamine as an adjunct&#xD;
      to opioid therapy for reducing opioid consumption in post-surgical adults admitted to the ICU&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine affects many pathways leading to inflammation cascade during sepsis. First, ketamine&#xD;
      has an immunosuppressive effect on immune cells such as NK cell cytotoxic activity,&#xD;
      neutrophil adhesion to endothelium, and chemotactic activity of neutrophils. Second, ketamine&#xD;
      decreases Toll-like receptor expression, nuclear factorkB activity, and Raf/Raf cascade.&#xD;
      Third, ketamine suppresses cytokines, superoxide, and nitric oxide productions, and reduces&#xD;
      the mitochondrial membrane potential in macrophages. Finally, ketamine prevents the&#xD;
      alteration of immune function in patients early after a major surgery, and increases survival&#xD;
      in rats with sepsis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was compromised only in the patients with pre-existing&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension and obstruction to the flow of cerebral spinal fluid. This has,&#xD;
      however, led to the persistent belief that ketamine is contraindicated in patients with&#xD;
      traumatic head injuries. Studies done subsequently have shown, however, that the effects of&#xD;
      ketamine on cerebral haemodynamics and ICP are in fact variable and depend on both the&#xD;
      presence of additional anaesthetic agents and PaCO2 values . Meta-analysis also suggests that&#xD;
      Ketamine does not increase ICP and provides favorable hemodynamics . Meta analysis has shown&#xD;
      that when ketamine is used in the presence of controlled ventilation, in conjunction with&#xD;
      anaesthetics which reduce cerebral metabolism such as GABA receptor agonists, ICP is not&#xD;
      increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard technique for ICP measurement is an intraventricular catheter[10]; however,&#xD;
      this method is invasive and can have complications . Non-invasive ICP (nICP) measurement is a&#xD;
      promising technique, still under development in adult and pediatric population .Optic nerve&#xD;
      sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement using ocular ultrasonography is a safe, quick, reliable&#xD;
      and reproducible technique for the assessment of ICP . Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography&#xD;
      (TCD) can also non-invasively assess ICP and CPP. Increased ICP produces characteristic&#xD;
      changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (FV) waveform that can be assessed by decreases in&#xD;
      the diastolic FV and increases in the pulsatility index (PI=systolic FV - diastolic FV) /&#xD;
      mean FV) and several methods TCD derived have been proposed to assess non invasively ICP,&#xD;
      showing good performance .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) usually manifests as sleep awakening cycle&#xD;
      disturbance, cognitive impairment, delirium, and coma . Considering that brain edema&#xD;
      secondary to SAE is one of the complications and causes of death in patients with sepsis,&#xD;
      early detection of intracranial hypertension (ICH) is of great significance for timely&#xD;
      intervention and improved prognosis. However, most patients with sepsis without intracranial&#xD;
      infection have no indications for invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring; thus,&#xD;
      non-invasive ICP monitoring was selected .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in patients without invasive ICP monitoring, nICP methods may be useful for&#xD;
      determining if ketamine infusion in septic patient will cause a pathological increase in ICP.&#xD;
