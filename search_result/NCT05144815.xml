  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, the proportion of people over 65 years of age is increasing rapidly, due&#xD;
      to rising life expectancy and declining fertility rates. According to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization, people in this age group will constitute 22% of the population by 2050, up from&#xD;
      the current 12% (WHO, 2018). Therefore, improving quality of life (healthspan) and preventing&#xD;
      disability has become a public health challenge (Olshansky, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, physical exercise has been shown to be able to prevent sarcopenia,&#xD;
      functional decline, the presence of chronic diseases and even mortality in this group&#xD;
      (Izquierdo et al., 2021; Lazarus, Lord, &amp; Harridge, 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A training method that could enhance the benefits of walking is ischaemic preconditioning&#xD;
      (IPC), characterised by the application of brief periods of circulatory occlusion-reperfusion&#xD;
      to a limb, minutes to hours prior to exercise. This type of intervention, initially used to&#xD;
      delay/prevent cell damage in patients with myocardial infarction (Murry, Jennings, &amp; Reimer,&#xD;
      1986), has recently shown beneficial effects in young people to improve physical performance&#xD;
      in a wide variety of sports (Caru, Levesque, Lalonde, &amp; Curnier, 2019), as well as to improve&#xD;
      recovery from associated muscle damage (Franz et al., 2018), which is of particular interest&#xD;
      in the adult population. In fact, the application of IPC alone for two weeks has been shown&#xD;
      to improve walking speed and reduce fatigue in post-stroke patients (Durand et al., 2019),&#xD;
      promising effects that could be increased when applied prior to resistance training, such as&#xD;
      walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an endurance exercise&#xD;
      programme preceded by ischaemic preconditioning on parameters related to physical function,&#xD;
      cognitive status and quality of life in older people. In addition, we set out to compare the&#xD;
      acute and chronic effect of the proposed interventions.&#xD;

      In recent decades, the proportion of people over 65 years of age is increasing rapidly, due&#xD;
      to rising life expectancy and declining fertility rates. According to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization, people in this age group will constitute 22% of the population by 2050, up from&#xD;
      the current 12% (WHO, 2018). Therefore, improving quality of life (healthspan) and preventing&#xD;
      disability has become a public health challenge (Olshansky, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, physical exercise has been shown to be able to prevent sarcopenia,&#xD;
      functional decline, the presence of chronic diseases and even mortality in this group&#xD;
      (Izquierdo et al., 2021; Lazarus, Lord, &amp; Harridge, 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance or endurance training can improve sarcopenia, reduce intramuscular fat&#xD;
      accumulation, improve muscle function, among others. Aerobic exercise has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in maintaining muscle mass and strength in older adults is walking (Kubo et al.,&#xD;
      2008). In fact, walking can also improve VO2max in older adults when intensities are above&#xD;
      âˆ¼40% VO2max (Nemoto, Gen-no, Masuki, Okazaki, &amp; Nose, 2007). In addition, it has been linked&#xD;
      to the prevention of cognitive decline (Maki et al., 2012) and improvements in quality of&#xD;
      life (Awick et al., 2015) in older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A training method that could enhance the benefits of walking is ischaemic preconditioning&#xD;
      (IPC), characterised by the application of brief periods of circulatory occlusion-reperfusion&#xD;
      to a limb, minutes to hours prior to exercise. This type of intervention, initially used to&#xD;
      delay/prevent cell damage in patients with myocardial infarction (Murry, Jennings, &amp; Reimer,&#xD;

      in a wide variety of sports (Caru, Levesque, Lalonde, &amp; Curnier, 2019), as well as to improve&#xD;
      recovery from associated muscle damage (Franz et al., 2018), which is of particular interest&#xD;
      in the adult population. In fact, the application of IPC alone for two weeks has been shown&#xD;

&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an endurance exercise&#xD;
      programme preceded by ischaemic preconditioning on parameters related to physical function,&#xD;
      cognitive status and quality of life in older people. In addition, we set out to compare the&#xD;
      acute and chronic effect of the proposed interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is a randomized clinical trial in which three groups of twenty people&#xD;
      in each group will participate, with different interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group 1: Exercise protocol + IPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group 2: Exercise protocol + sham IPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group. Participants will be evaluated in four moments, at baseline, immediately&#xD;
           after the first session, postintervention (after 6-week intervention) and 4-week&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed with SPSS statistic program (v26). Normality and&#xD;
      homoscedasticity will be analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk t-test and Levene test, respectively. For&#xD;
      comparation between groups Bonferroni will be used. If any confusion factor that not meet&#xD;
      requirements to be analysed like a covariable exist, ANCOVA will be used. When p&lt;0.0.5&#xD;
      statistical significant differences will be assumed.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise protocol: endurance training protocol consisting of walking 20 min at moderate intensity (i.e. 64- 76 % HRmax, 12-13 Borg Scale) in a circuit designed in an open field, 3 times a week, for 6 weeks.&#xD;
IPC: participants will be placed in a supine position and a pneumatic compression cuff (Riester Komprimeter, Jungingen Germany) (96 centimetres long x 13 centimetres wide) will be placed on the proximal part of each lower extremity. Occlusion will then be performed by inflating the cuff to 220 mmHg for 5 minutes, followed by reperfusion to 0 mmHg for 5 minutes. Each session will consist of 3 sets of 5 minutes of ischaemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion.</description>
