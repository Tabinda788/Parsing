    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label and parallel phase I study to compare pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety of goserelin acetate sustained-release microspheres for&#xD;
      injection (LY01005) and ZOLADEX® following multiple administration in patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase I trial. A total of 23 patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer who were suitable for endocrine therapy&#xD;
      were enrolled into the screening period from D-21 to D-10 (±3d) before administration.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects were treated with bicalutamide tablets (Casodex®, 50 mg/day) from D-10 (±&#xD;
      3d) to the end of the trial and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive LY01005 3.6 mg or&#xD;
      ZOLADEX ® 3.6 mg after completion of pretreatment. All subjects were administered once every&#xD;
      28 days for three doses. Blood samples were collected at the specified time points in the&#xD;
      trial protocol to detect PK parameters of goserelin, and PD parameters (serum testosterone,&#xD;
      LH and FSH). Safety evaluation (including vital signs, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, 12 ECG, adverse events, etc.) was conducted as required in the protocol. This study&#xD;
      aimed to compare PK/PD and safety of LY01005 and ZOLADEX® in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
