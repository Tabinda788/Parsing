  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric establishments show significant disparities in terms of coercion: while some use&#xD;
      it frequently, others use it only exceptionally. This project aims at a better understanding&#xD;
      of the less coercive establishments, which are currently little investigated and whose study&#xD;
      may allow to identify the levers of a psychiatry more respectful of individual liberties.&#xD;

      This study aims precisely at understanding the history of less coercive establishments, and&#xD;
      at identifying the knowledge as well as the forms of organization, coordination and&#xD;
      cooperation that are developed there. To do so, it will consist of an inventory of&#xD;
      establishments and practices based on the analysis of scientific literature, and an intensive&#xD;
      study of seven less coercive establishments (four establishments on the French national&#xD;
      territory, three establishments in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region). The study of these&#xD;
      institutions and their environment, which mobilizes nursing research and sociology, is based&#xD;
      on a methodological approach combining interviews with professionals and users, observations&#xD;
      in the institutions and services, a documentary method, and analysis of data from the RIM-P,&#xD;
      the SAE, and the institutions' databases.&#xD;
