    <textblock>
      This feasibility pilot cluster RCT aims to pilot and feasibility test an online training&#xD;
      toolkit (Managing Minds at Work) for line managers to develop their knowledge and confidence&#xD;
      in preventing work-related stress and promoting mental health at work. The setting is work&#xD;
      organisations of different types and sectors across the Midlands region of the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. Participants must have direct managerial or supervisor responsibilities for 3 or&#xD;
      more staff members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of five modules of online learning on the following topics: Looking&#xD;
      after your own Mental Health; Designing and managing work to promote mental well-being;&#xD;
      Management competencies to prevent work-related stress; Developing a psychologically safe&#xD;
      work environment; Having conversations about mental health at work. Each module includes some&#xD;
      descriptive content, interactive elements and opportunities for reflections, and take between&#xD;
      20-30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating organisations will be allocated to either the intervention or control arm. A&#xD;
      waiting list control will be used, with line managers in the control organisations starting&#xD;
      the intervention 3-months after baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected through online surveys with the intervention group at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately post-intervention (around 6 weeks post baseline), and 3-months follow-up. Control&#xD;
      group will complete the online surveys at baseline and 3-months (as they start the&#xD;
      intervention). As a feasibility pilot study, analysis will be focused on estimating&#xD;
      parameters for a larger trial. The primary outcome measure is line managers' confidence to&#xD;
      create a mentally healthy workplace. The secondary outcomes line manger mental health&#xD;
      knowledge, line manager workplace mental health literacy, line manager self-rating of&#xD;
      behaviour. In addition, the direct reports of line managers will be invited to participate to&#xD;
      assess any change in the following outcomes: employee well-being, employee rating of line&#xD;
      manager behaviour, employee sickness absence, employee productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A process evaluation will be conducted alongside the pilot cRCT to assess intervention&#xD;
      acceptability, usability, implementation and effectiveness. Qualitative data will be&#xD;
      collected via module feedback forms after the completion of each module and in-depth&#xD;
      interviews after the 3-month follow-up with a sample of line managers from the intervention&#xD;
      arm and stakeholders (e.g. senior managers, HR managers, Well-being managers).&#xD;

      Study Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this project is to develop, pilot and feasibility test a new online&#xD;
      training course (Managing Minds at Work) for line managers which provides guidance on&#xD;
      preventing work-related stress and promoting mental health at work. This study will aim to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of a full cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the training on improving line managers' outcomes (confidence, knowledge,&#xD;
      behaviour) and employee outcomes (well-being, perceptions of line manager behaviours,&#xD;
      sickness absence). In order to assess the feasibility and the potential effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention, the study will test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to pilot the Managing Minds at Work training intervention in order&#xD;
      to test its effectiveness in changing the primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ line managers confidence to create a mentally healthy workplace&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to pilot the Managing Minds at Work training intervention in order&#xD;
      to test its effectiveness in changing the following secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  line manger mental health knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  line manager workplace mental health literacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  line manager self-rating of behaviour&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  employee sickness absence (organisational records)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  employee productivity (self-reported)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster RCT Design This feasibility pilot study is a multi-site, two-armed cluster randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial taking place in work organisations of different sizes and sectors across the&#xD;
      Midlands area. The organisations are the units of randomisation (the clusters), with data&#xD;
      collected from individual line managers (the participants) and the employees who work under&#xD;
      their managers (their direct reports) within those organisations. If large, multi-site&#xD;
      organisations are recruited to the study, the investigators will consider the option of using&#xD;
      an internal control group within that organisation if there is a low risk of contamination&#xD;
      between the intervention arm and control arm within that large organisation. The data&#xD;
      collection schedule for the study is summarised in Table 2 and 3 below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection in Intervention Arm In the intervention arm, line managers will be invited to&#xD;
      complete the online training course over a maximum period of 6 weeks. A repeated measures&#xD;
      design will be adopted, whereby participants in the intervention arm will complete online&#xD;
      questionnaires to collect data at baseline, on completion of the training (6 weeks), and at 3&#xD;
      months follow-up. Line managers' direct reports will also be invited to complete online&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Where available, data will also be&#xD;
      collected from organisational records on the sickness absence levels of employees managed by&#xD;
      the participating line managers. Details of the measures in the online surveys are in the&#xD;
      Outcome Measure section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection in Control Arm The study will employ a waitlist control, with line managers&#xD;
      in the organisations within the control arm receiving the intervention after three months.&#xD;
      Line managers in the control arm of the study will complete online questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, just before the start of the training (3 months after baseline), immediately after&#xD;
      completing the training (4.5 months after baseline). Line managers' direct reports will also&#xD;
      be invited to complete online questionnaires at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Where&#xD;
      available, data will also be collected from organisational records on the sickness absence&#xD;
      levels of employees managed by the participating line managers. Details of the measures in&#xD;
      the online surveys are in the Outcome Measure section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation A qualitative process evaluation will run alongside the pilot trial to&#xD;
      explore the experience of the intervention with line managers and other stakeholders within&#xD;
      participating organisations, and assess the acceptability, usability and utility of the&#xD;
      intervention and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. Semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews will be used to collect the data to inform the process evaluation. In addition,&#xD;
      and module feedback forms will be completed by line managers after each of the modules in the&#xD;
      training course to allow more specific feedback including any changes in their managerial&#xD;
      practice that participants are planning to make as a result of completing the module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding Organisations (clusters) will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either&#xD;
      the intervention or waiting list control group using an online random sequence generator&#xD;
      (https://www.random.org/sequences/ ). This allocation will be stratified to ensure a spread&#xD;
      of different size of organisations within the intervention and control arms. Where the&#xD;
      organisation is sufficiently large to have distinct departments/divisions/units with minimal&#xD;
      risk of contamination between them, the investigators will look to randomly assign two of&#xD;
      these different departments/divisions/units to either intervention or the waiting list&#xD;
      control using the same approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team and participants will not be blinded to the outcome of randomisation due to&#xD;
      practical reasons (i.e. sending reminder emails to participating managers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and Withdrawal Of Participants Organisations The study setting will be any&#xD;
      organisation with line managers and employees within the Midlands area. Participating&#xD;
      organisations will be recruited through the communication channels (Twitter, Newsletters,&#xD;
      Website). Organisations that register their interest will be receive a follow-up phone call&#xD;
      from the lead researcher to provide further information about the study (Information Sheet&#xD;
      for Organisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Managers within the participating organisations will be approached to&#xD;
      participate in the study through a poster/flyer about the study, which will be shared with&#xD;
      them by the gatekeeper within the organisation. Line managers who express interest in taking&#xD;
      part will be given information about the study and asked to provide written consent prior to&#xD;
      participating in the study (individual-level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating managers will be asked to share details of the study with their direct reports&#xD;
      (people who they directly manage) to invite them to also participate in an online survey at&#xD;
      baseline and 3 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the process evaluation interview study, participants will be invited to take part in&#xD;
      interviews after the 3-month follow-up. Interviews will take place with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Line managers in the intervention arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stakeholders (e.g. HR managers, Well-being co-ordinators etc) in both the intervention&#xD;
           and control arms For line managers, on completing individual-level study consent all&#xD;
           participants will have been asked to consent to being contacted by a qualitative&#xD;
           researcher to take part in an interview. Those who have consented will be contacted and&#xD;
           asked if they want to participate in a follow-up interview, and if so will be sent a PIS&#xD;
           and consent form by email. Interviews will be conducted face-to-face, by video call or&#xD;
           by telephone. Interviews will be arranged at a mutually convenient time and location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For stakeholders, the gatekeeper for each participating organisation (intervention and&#xD;
      control arms) will be asked to email an invitation to participate in an interview to all&#xD;
      relevant stakeholders within their organisation e.g. HR managers, well-being managers,&#xD;
      learning and development managers, trade union representatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation Interviews Semi-structured interviews will take place with line managers&#xD;
      and direct reports from the intervention arm, and with stakeholders from both the&#xD;
      intervention and control arm. These semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a&#xD;
      random selection of participants following the completion of the training programme, to&#xD;
      achieve a maximum variance sample based on size of organisation, sector, and participant&#xD;
      demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principles of data saturation will be used to guide the final sample size, but as a guideline&#xD;
      the investigators would expect there to be interviews with approximately 20 line managers, 10&#xD;
      direct report, and 1 to 2 stakeholders per participating organisation. All of interviews and&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted by member of the research team (CB, BV and KN). Interviews will be&#xD;
      guided by the Interview Schedules and recorded using an encrypted digital recorder where&#xD;
      consent is given. Digital audio files will be transferred to the transcription service Dict8&#xD;
      for transcription using secure FTP. Transcriptions will be anonymised. Audio files will be&#xD;
      destroyed after transcripts have been checked. Anonymised transcriptions will be analysed and&#xD;
      stored on the secure University of Nottingham server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews with line managers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview schedule will cover the following research questions and topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability, usability and utility of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes the line manager has introduced since undertaking the training&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers and facilitators to the intervention implementation and effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suggested improvements to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews with stakeholders&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview schedule will cover the following research questions and topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers and facilitators to taking part in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability of the wait-list control condition (control arm only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability, usability and utility of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers and facilitators to the intervention implementation and effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organisational Sickness Absence Records The investigators will collect information from the&#xD;
      organisations regarding the sickness absence records of those the participating line managers&#xD;
      directly manage. Pre-intervention data will cover the 6-months prior to the intervention&#xD;
      starting. Post-intervention data will cover the 6-months post-intervention completion. All&#xD;
      organisational absence records will be anonymised at source before being securely transferred&#xD;
      to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Sample size Statistical analysis will be produce summary statistics&#xD;
      to assess the parameters for a full trial. Missing outcome data will be imputed using&#xD;
      multiple imputation. SPSS or PSSP will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a pilot trial, no emphasis will be put on the p values for any inferential&#xD;
      statistical tests conducted. The pilot data will provide information on the parameters needed&#xD;
      for a realistic sample size calculation (mean, standard deviation and treatment effects of&#xD;
      the primary outcome for the two arms) for a future, main cluster RCT. A minimum of 8 clusters&#xD;
      (randomised into two groups of four) will be sought in order to inform a future trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation As part of the process evaluation additional qualitative data collection&#xD;
      regarding the acceptability, usability, implementation, and effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
      will be collected through interviews with line managers, direct reports and stakeholders. The&#xD;
      qualitative data collected will be analysed using thematic analysis within a framework&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
