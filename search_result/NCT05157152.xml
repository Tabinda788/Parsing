      In critically ill patients, AKI is a common complication of COVID-19 infection, occurring in&#xD;
      23% to 43% of cases, and was correlated with poor clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increase in liver function tests ( LFTs) has been found in patients with COVID-19 ranging&#xD;
      14%-75% Some studies found higher levels of transaminases in patients with severe COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia and in patients dying for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial reports indicate a high incidence of abnormal liver tests and acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI) in the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesis that there is a relationship between COVID-19 patients who are critically ill,&#xD;
      liver enzymes and level of serum creatinine&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects multiple organ systems&#xD;
      and imparts significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Approximately 5% to 14% of patients&#xD;
      affected with SARS-CoV-2 will become critically ill [2-4]. While coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) generally begins as a respiratory tract infection, it can damage any organ system.&#xD;
      Thus, to improve outcomes, clinicians should search actively for multi-organ involvement to&#xD;
      guide appropriate early management [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among affected organs, the kidney is particularly susceptible to COVID-19. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      has been shown to share the same functional receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),&#xD;
      with a wide variety of organs (such as lung, heart, kidney) [6]. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its&#xD;
      infection process by binding to functional receptors on the membrane of a host cell.&#xD;
      Postmortem examination of COVID-19 patients revealed varying degrees of acute tubular&#xD;
      necrosis, lymphocytic infiltration, and viral RNA, suggesting direct invasion of kidney&#xD;
      tubules [7]. In addition to direct kidney damage by the virus, acute kidney injury (AKI) can&#xD;
      occur through several proposed mechanisms including acute tubular necrosis induced by sepsis,&#xD;
      hypoxia, hypoperfusion, rhabdomyolysis, nephrotoxic drugs, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In critically ill patients, AKI is a common complication of COVID-19 infection, occurring in&#xD;
      23% to 43% of cases, and was correlated with poor clinical outcomes. AKI was defined as per&#xD;
      Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria: a change in the serum creatinine&#xD;
      of 0.3 mg/dL over 48 h period or 50% increase in baseline creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increase in liver function tests ( LFTs) has been found in patients with COVID-19 ranging&#xD;
      14%-75% Some studies found higher levels of transaminases in patients with severe COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia and in patients dying for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical relevance of LFTs abnormalities has been controversial, with some studies&#xD;
      suggesting its association with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas others not.Some&#xD;
      limitations affected those studies involving the lack of information about concomitant or&#xD;
      previous use of hepatotoxic drugs among the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial reports indicate a high incidence of abnormal liver tests and acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI) in the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). However, outcomes in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 and elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase&#xD;
      (ALT) levels at admission and their associations with AKI are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of liver injury at admission and its&#xD;
      contribution to the development of AKI, severity of COVID-19 and outcomes in Sohag University&#xD;
      hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, observational cohort study will be conducted between December 2021 and May&#xD;
      2022 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Sohag University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are positive for COVID-19 infection in Sohag University Hospital whose ages &lt; 18&#xD;
      years old. (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal&#xD;
      samples) who developed AKI at time of admission or during admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose ages &gt;18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A prospective, observational cohort study will be conducted between December 2021 and&#xD;
      April 2022 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Sohag University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine laboratory parameters will be measured before the beginning of this Study After&#xD;
      conducting a complete physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data will be collected at admission.&#xD;
      Information on medical history, including comorbidities, symptoms of infection and drugs&#xD;
      taken in the previous 14 days before admission will be collected. Vital signs (respiratory&#xD;
      rate [RR], body temperature [BT], arterial blood pressure, heart rate [HR], pulse oxygen&#xD;
      saturation [SatO2] were collected. Laboratory tests including alanine aminotransferase (ALT),&#xD;
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum Albumin, Total protein, serum creatinine, Blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen, serum electrolytes and bilirubin were collected at admission and every 7 Â± 2 days&#xD;
      during the admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be divided into three groups as mild, moderate, and&#xD;
      severe disease to evaluate the relationship between disease severity and AKI. Patients with&#xD;
      clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnoea, fast breathing) plus one of the&#xD;
      following: respiratory rate &gt;30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress;or SpO2 &lt; 90% on&#xD;
      room air will be considered as severe cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pneumonia and have no above severity criteria will be considered as moderate&#xD;
      cases. Symptomatic patients without evidence of viral pneumonia or hypoxia will be considered&#xD;
      as mild cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science ( SPSS&#xD;
      to investigate the incidence of liver injury at admission and its contribution to the&#xD;
      development of AKI, severity of COVID-19 and outcomes in Sohag University hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be assessed by scientific and ethical committee of Sohag faculty of medicine,&#xD;
      an informed written consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
