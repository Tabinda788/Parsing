  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which is&#xD;
      characterized by impairments of social communication, social reciprocity, as well as&#xD;
      restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB). The unclear pathogenesis of ASD, its increasing&#xD;
      prevalence, and its poor clinical diagnosis and treatment effect have caused a serious&#xD;
      economic and mental burden on patients and their families. As a new non-invasive&#xD;
      neuroelectrophysiological technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used&#xD;
      more and more in the interventional treatment of autism. The current project aims to explore&#xD;
      the influence of TMS on brain plasticity in autism by using TMS for interventional treatment&#xD;
      of autism and provide guidelines for the intervention and treatment of autism by evaluating&#xD;
      the efficiency of these methods.&#xD;

      of autism and provide guidelines for the intervention and treatment of autism by evaluating&#xD;
      the efficiency of these methods. Investigators conduct a randomized, double-blind, controlled&#xD;
      TMS trial and collect the participants' stool samples and sequence the gut microbiome before&#xD;
      the first magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scan. Besides, investigators collect brain imaging&#xD;
      data, eye movement data and clinical scale score before and after TMS trial to explore the&#xD;
      changes of TMS treatment on clinical behavior and brain plasticity and provide guidelines for&#xD;
      the intervention and treatment of autism.&#xD;
