  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the safety and usability of the WRL HX MCP&#xD;
      medical device, a prototypal robotic system for metacarpophalangeal joint mobilization. WRL&#xD;
      HX MCP was developed by the Wearable Robotics Laboratory of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in a&#xD;
      project funded by and in collaboration with INAIL, to fulfil the needs of patients with&#xD;
      post-traumatic hand stiffness.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the safety and reliability of the WRL HX MCP device for assisting flexion and&#xD;
           extension movement of the stiff metacarpophalangeal joint&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a preliminary examination of the efficacy of the device in the treatment of&#xD;
           joint stiffness to design a subsequent RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the performance of the device in estimating the biomechanical parameters useful&#xD;
           for the objective treatment outcome assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten injured workers with post-traumatic and/or post-operative index finger MCP stiffness will&#xD;
      be enrolled in a clinical trial consisting of one to four sessions of robotic therapy with&#xD;
      WRL HX MCP at the INAIL Rehabilitation Center in Volterra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot testing of the experimental device will include the preliminary goniometric measure of&#xD;
      passive and active MCP range of motion (ROM), the selection of the appropriate size of&#xD;
      exoskeleton segments to fit user's anthropometry, the robotic assessment of ROM, force and&#xD;
      torque trajectories of MCP joint, a program of robot-assisted passive and active MCF&#xD;
      mobilization and a final clinical and robotic reassessment of joint ROM. The session will&#xD;
      last about 1 hour and all exercises will be administered by a trained physical therapist&#xD;
      supported by two members of the engineering team; pain level will be assessed at baseline and&#xD;
      after each mobilization sequence; patient feedback will be recorded about the usability of&#xD;
      the device in term of comfort, wearability, user safety, and overall satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1, the Safety and Reliability of the device will be evaluated in terms of the number&#xD;
      of adverse events and malfunctions occurring during the study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2, the efficacy of robot-assisted mobilization modes will be assessed by means of the&#xD;
      longitudinal analysis of pre- and post-treatment measurements of MCP range of motion and pain&#xD;
      intensity level, the flexion peak torque evaluation and the final administration of an ad-hoc&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For aim 3, the performance of WRL HX MCP will be studied by comparing the robotic MCP angle&#xD;
      estimation with the measurements from a motion capture system.&#xD;

    <description>WRL HX MCP is a non CE marked class IIa medical device designed for clinical application in hand rehabilitation; it consists in a cable-driven robotic MCP orthosis providing flexion-extension of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. WRL HX MCP features and a series-elastic actuators (SEA) architecture for compliant actuation of MCP flexion-extension and a self-aligning mechanism to absorb human/robot joint axes misplacement. Exoskeleton module is mounted on a dorsal hand support and connected to its electronic box through wires.</description>
