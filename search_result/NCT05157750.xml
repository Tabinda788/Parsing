  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within this study, the investigators aim to directly compare the value of endoscopic&#xD;
      remission, histologic remission and barrier healing for predicting long-term disease behavior&#xD;
      in a large cohort of clinically remittent IBD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucosal healing is a key therapeutic goal in the management of patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel diseases (IBD) that is associated with favorable long-term disease outcome. In&#xD;
      addition, histologic remission is an emerging endpoint and first data suggest that functional&#xD;
      assessment of the integrity of the intestinal barrier, i.e. barrier healing, by confocal&#xD;
      laser endomicroscopy (CLE) correlates to clinical disease behavior and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this study, the investigators will prospectively include IBD patients in clinical&#xD;
      remission and assess endoscopic remission, histologic remission and barrier healing during&#xD;
      baseline ileocolonoscopy. Participants will then be closely followed up in the IBD outpatient&#xD;
      department of the University Hospital Erlangen every 4 to 8 weeks for participants under&#xD;
      biological therapy and every 8 weeks for participants under conventional therapy. At each&#xD;
      visit, clinical disease activity using the Mayo Clinical Score (MCS) and the Crohn's disease&#xD;
      activity Index (CDAI), respectively, routine laboratory parameters and current and past&#xD;
      medications will be recorded. Further, at each visit, major clinical events (MCE), defined as&#xD;
      (i) disease flare; (ii) IBD-related hospitalization, (iii) IBD-related surgery, (iv)&#xD;
      necessity for initiation of systemic steroids, immunosuppressants or biologics; (v) necessity&#xD;
      for escalation of an existing biological therapy, will be recorded. The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      this study is to comparatively assess the predictive values of barrier healing, endoscopic&#xD;
      remission and histologic remission for predicting occurrence of MCE in IBD patients in&#xD;
      clinical remission&#xD;
