  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is done aiming to find out an effective method to induce second trimester abortion&#xD;
      within a reasonable time and with the least possible cost and complications.&#xD;

      od complete history taking and examination will be performed including measurement of blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse and temperature. Skin was examined for petichae or ecchymosis to exclude&#xD;
      coagulation defects or blood diseases. The abdominal examination included detection of the&#xD;
      size of the uterus (in cm above symphysis pubis), presence of scar of previous laparotomy,&#xD;
      tenderness or rigidity. The local examination included detection of uterine size by bimanual&#xD;
      examination, cervical dilatation, consistency, effacement, and position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient was investigated for hemoglobin content, Rh-typing, blood sugar level,&#xD;
      Coagulation profile, renal function tests, and liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our patients were divided into 2 groups, each containing-- patients: In the First group,&#xD;
      induction of abortion was carried out by prostaglandin E1 methyl analogue, Misoprestol. It&#xD;
      was given by vaginal routeIn the second group, induction of abortion will be started with&#xD;
      Dilapan.s followed by surgical evacuation In the First group, the initial Bishop score will&#xD;
      be recorded and the minimal dose of one tablet was inserted deep in the posterior fornix. The&#xD;
      dose will be repeated every 4 hours till the products of conception are expelled. If remnants&#xD;
      of conception are retained for more than 30 minutes, oxytocin drip will be initiated starting&#xD;
      with a minimal dose of 2.5 U in 500-ml glucose 5%. Failure of induction was considered if&#xD;
      uterine contractions and start of expulsion had not occurred within 36 hours from initiation&#xD;
      of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second group, The vagina will be prepared with Povidine iodine as an antiseptic, which&#xD;
      is also used to moisten the dilators. A sterile speculum will be inserted and after&#xD;
      inspection of the cervix, the anterior lip will stabilized with ring forceps. Using gentle&#xD;
      traction on the cervix, the Dilapan dilator will be inserted into the cervical canal, the&#xD;
      upper vagina will then packed with a sterile gauze to maintain the dilator in place. The&#xD;
      dilators were left for a period not less than 6 and not more than 24 hours. After removal of&#xD;
      the gauze, the Dilapan handle will be grasped with forceps and removed with gentle steady&#xD;
      downward traction on Dialpan loop itself. The cervical dilatation will be measured by Hegar's&#xD;
      dilators and recorded. Surgical evacuation will then carried out under general anesthesia. In&#xD;
      cases with gestational age more than 16 weeks, an oxytocin infusion will be&#xD;
      MasterDegreeThesis/MFA/ISRO/FacultyOfMedicine/ASU Page 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      added to induce uterine contractions and expulsion of the contents. Failure was considered if&#xD;
      dilatation of the cervix was not achieved, or if there was no response to oxytocin within 36&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data were recorded in an investigative report form and Sudent's (t) test was used to&#xD;
      compare means, P value of &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;

    <description>is an osmotic hygroscopic dilator produced from a patented Aquacryl® hydrogel that guarantees consistency of action.&#xD;
It is a rigid gel rod that increases in volume by absorbing fluids from the cervical canal, so it gradually dilates the cervix The thin 4 mm rod can expand up to 15 mm over a 12-24 hours period. This allows it to dilate and soften the cervix gradually.</description>
