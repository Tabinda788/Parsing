  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effects of an intervention to improve emotional regulation&#xD;
      skills in adolescents with affective (anxiety and/or depression) and behavioral problems.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional regulation skills and strategies are a protective factor against various problems&#xD;
      and psychopathologies. The development and maintenance of affective symptoms are usually very&#xD;
      harmful to the adolescent and for his/her family and social environment and can lead to other&#xD;
      more serious psychological problems (depression, anxiety, adaptive disorders, etc.) or&#xD;
      problems of socio-educational maladjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to improve the emotional regulation of adolescents who present affective&#xD;
      symptoms related to anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems, such as difficulties in&#xD;
      their interpersonal relationships, impulsivity, anxiety, anger attacks, low tolerance to&#xD;
      frustration, apathy, or sadness. The intervention program, applied through a video game, is&#xD;
      an intervention protocol for emotional well-being that has been tested and validated in an&#xD;
      adolescent population with emotional and behavioral problems.&#xD;
