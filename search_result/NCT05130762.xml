  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will collect use data of the Becton Dickinson (BD) PureHub™ Disinfecting Cap in&#xD;
      combination with needle-free connectors, which are attached to vascular access devices (VAD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective observational study of a minimum of 150 study&#xD;
      participants who have vascular access devices (VADs) with needle-free connectors as part of&#xD;
      their routine medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed from the time of enrollment through the duration of VAD therapy or&#xD;
      45 days post enrollment date, whichever comes first.&#xD;
