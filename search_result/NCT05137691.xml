  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to assess the feasibility of a larger, definitive RCT and determine the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of an NHS 1:1 programme versus a modified programme with a low&#xD;
      carbohydrate dietary intervention (as per Feinman and colleagues classification) with&#xD;
      telehealth, physical activity and enhanced behaviour change on specified health outcomes&#xD;
      amongst post-partum women living with obesity&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For individuals living with obesity, the post-partum period is currently the initial, optimal&#xD;
      timeframe for weight management. Many women reconceive during the post-partum phase,&#xD;
      increasing the risk of between-pregnancy bodyweight retention and even gain. Consequentially,&#xD;
      many re-enter subsequent pregnancies with a higher BMI often associated with unfavourable&#xD;
      obstetric outcome and further cyclical perpetuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health behaviour change is an important facet within weight management interventions and&#xD;
      delivery may be enhanced by digital technologies, for example, telehealth. Short messaging&#xD;
      service (SMS) may be used to enhance communication between patients and practitioner and is&#xD;
      relatively inexpensive to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low carbohydrate diets continue to gain traction however research is arguably confounded by&#xD;
      the lack of a universally agreed definition and classification. Feinman and colleagues (2015)&#xD;
      propose intermediary categories. The experimental arm of this trial will be encouraged to&#xD;
      adopt a non-ketogenic LCD as per Feinman.&#xD;
