  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are rapidly spreading&#xD;
      worldwide and continue to be a global public health crisis. The use of repurposed drugs with&#xD;
      the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 could be a vital alternative approach when the novel&#xD;
      therapeutic has not yet available. The guidelines for emergency treatment of COVID-19 vary&#xD;
      across different countries and largely rely on the off-label prescription of repurposed&#xD;
      drugs. As a result, clinical studies to generate robust efficacy data for these repurposed&#xD;
      drugs are warranted to effectively fight against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad spectrum antiparasitic drug ivermectin has previously been shown to exhibit broad&#xD;
      antiviral activities against many RNA and DNA viruses. It has a reliable safety profile with&#xD;
      comprehensive data for decades especially in mass drug administration programs for river&#xD;
      blindness prophylaxis in several countries in Africa. Owing to its strong inhibitory activity&#xD;
      against the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its putative role in reducing cytokine&#xD;
      storm, the drug has been repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients and has shown promising&#xD;
      results in several clinical studies. Ivermectin has thus gained a considerable attention as a&#xD;
      potential treatment for COVID-19. However, the National Institute of Health (NIH) and World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) currently state that studies on using ivermectin to treat COVID-19&#xD;
      patients remain inconclusive due to insufficient data. Therefore, a large well designed&#xD;
      randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of ivermectin is&#xD;
      urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important treatment option for COVID-19 is favipiravir, an antiviral drug for&#xD;
      influenza treatment. Although the drug has not been approved for a COVID-19 treatment by the&#xD;
      US-FDA, it has been included in Guidelines on clinical practice, diagnosis, treatment, and&#xD;
      prevention of healthcare-associated infection for COVID-19 in Thailand. Favipiravir, a known&#xD;
      inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, was shown to have an in vitro activity against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. The meta-analysis showed a significant improvement in clinical outcome at day 14&#xD;
      along with chest imaging in the favipiravir group compared to standard care. However, there&#xD;
      are no significant differences in terms of clinical deterioration rates, viral clearance,&#xD;
      oxygen support requirement and side effect profiles. There are still ongoing clinical trials&#xD;
      assessing the effectiveness of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antivirals can be generally divided into direct-acting antivirals (DAA) and host-targeting&#xD;
      drugs. For example, the widely used drug remdesivir repurposed to treat COVID-19 is a DAA,&#xD;
      and chloroquine is considered a host-targeting drug. Because these repurposed drugs were not&#xD;
      specifically designed and developed for COVID-19, they are likely to be less efficacious, and&#xD;
      partner drugs need to be further explored. Finding a right combination for DAA is a common&#xD;
      practice for developing virus treatment regimens. Relying on different modes of action and&#xD;
      absence of unfavorable drug interaction, the combinations are usually additive or&#xD;
      synergistic. It is important to note that our in vitro data demonstrated the synergistic&#xD;
      profile for the combination of favipiravir and ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2. It resulted in&#xD;
      4-fold reduction in the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) as compared to&#xD;
      individual drugs, from 1.2 µM to 0.3 µM with a peak Loewe synergy score of over 33.2 and a&#xD;
      mean score of 18.8 (noted that Loewe synergy score &gt; 10 indicates synergistic effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to this COVID-19 pandemic crisis, especially in a resource limited setting like&#xD;
      Thailand, clinical studies to evaluate affordable and implementable interventions are a&#xD;
      priority and are urgently needed. Ivermectin, a cheap and safe drug, has been widely used in&#xD;
      humans for decades, and it has also demonstrated an inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
      vitro. Here, we aim to conduct a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in&#xD;
      Thailand to reveal the effectiveness of ivermectin as a combination therapy with favipiravir&#xD;
      (standard treatment) for COVID-19. The results of this study will provide much needed&#xD;
      information for pursuing larger efficacy clinical trials to confirm whether the combination&#xD;
      could be effectively used to treat COVID-19. Also, they could provide information on the rate&#xD;
      of viral clearance, the primary endpoint of this study, which was proposed to be a predictive&#xD;
      surrogate of clinical benefits and used as a proper endpoint in the phase II trials for&#xD;
      candidate drug screening for COVID-19.&#xD;
