      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare esketamine and ketorolac separately and in combination to prevent postoperative&#xD;
      pain and cognitive dysfunction after total knee arthroplasty&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increase in human life span, orthopedic injuries and subsequent repair surgery have&#xD;
      become a major health problem which impairs the life quality of patients and burdens&#xD;
      healthcare systems worldwide. Poor post-surgical pain control is a leading factor that&#xD;
      hinders the physical rehabilitation and musculoskeletal functional recovery, and causes acute&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and chronic pain syndrome. Therefore, prophylaxis of postoperative pain&#xD;
      is indispensable to postoperative comfort and satisfaction. There is no denying the fact that&#xD;
      pathologic pain is related to central glutaminergic system and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)&#xD;
      receptor activation induced central sensitization. Also, we previously reported that&#xD;
      neuroinflammation is associated with pain development and cognitive dysfunction. Ketamine, a&#xD;
      NMDA receptor antagonist, is effective in reversing NMDA receptor activation underlying pain&#xD;
      states. But the side effects of ketamine limit its clinical application, such as gibberish&#xD;
      and agitation. It is clarified that esketamine has lower side effects than ketamine and that&#xD;
      antinociception of esketamine is stronger than ketamine. The following study is carried out&#xD;
      to evaluate whether esketamine and ketorolac can prevent postoperative pain and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment after total knee arthroplasty in patients.&#xD;
