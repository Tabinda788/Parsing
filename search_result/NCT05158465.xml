  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to promote oral hygiene behaviors (toothbrushing, flossing) and&#xD;
      oral health with high-risk adolescents in San Diego, CA, through a Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      (MI) Intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate the efficacy of a new, brief&#xD;
      motivational interviewing (MI)- based intervention and assess its impact on several sets of&#xD;
      outcomes among 14-19 years old Latino adolescents: clinical oral health and hygiene indices,&#xD;
      counts of biological caries-causing bacteria, and oral hygiene behaviors. Three one-on-one,&#xD;
      half hour educational and skill-building MI sessions will address: proper oral hygiene&#xD;
      technique, bacteria and dental caries process, and nutrition. Intervention group adolescents&#xD;
      will also receive three telephone calls (one/month reinforcing their hygiene behavior goals.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T1), and at one-month (T2), after the intervention&#xD;
      group received three MI sessions and three booster calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To develop and assess a new Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based behavioral oral&#xD;
      health intervention for Latino adolescents in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.&#xD;
      Finalize all intervention educational materials and scripts and assessment tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To assess the efficacy of the brief intervention on reductions in clinically&#xD;
      determined outcomes among intervention versus control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To assess the efficacy of the brief intervention on reductions in the presence and&#xD;
      count of two types of biological bacteria involved in the dental caries disease process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. To assess the efficacy of the brief intervention in increasing the frequency of daily&#xD;
      oral hygiene behaviors, including properly brushing, flossing, and rinsing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5. Conduct process evaluation via two focus groups post-intervention to assess the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and assessments (one for intervention&#xD;
      group; one for control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will see improved clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, lower bacteria counts, and better oral hygiene behavior than the control group.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Plaque Score at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and post-intervention (after about one month)</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque levels will be scored for each participant based on photographs taken after the use of a plaque disclosure tablet. This will be scored as low (minimum), moderate, or high (maximum). Lower is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Gum Bleeding at 1 month.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, and post-intervention (after about one month)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will use a toothpick to probe 14 points in the mouth (7 points in the maxillary anterior teeth and 7 points in the mandibular anterior teeth). At each point, if the participant bleeds, they are given a score of &quot;1&quot;. Then the score is added up at the end of probing each point. Minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 14. Lower score is better and higher score is worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Weekly Toothbrushing at 1 month.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, and post-intervention (after about one month)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will self-report frequency of toothbrushing in the past 7 days on a survey. This will be scored as a continuous count (minimum is zero, no set maximum) and whether or not they met ADA recommended guidelines for twice daily brushing. Higher frequency is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Weekly Flossing at 1 month.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, and post-intervention (after about one month)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will self-report frequency of flossing in the last 7 days on a survey. This will be scored as a continuous count (minimum is zero, no set maximum) and whether or not they met ADA recommended guidelines for once daily flossing. Higher frequency is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Weekly Rinsing at 1 month.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, and post-intervention (after about one month)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will self-report frequency of rinsing with water in the last 7 days on a survey. This will be scored as a continuous count (minimum is zero, no set maximum). Higher frequency is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Oral Hygiene at 1 month.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, and post-intervention (after about one month)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant's oral hygiene skill level will be assessed and scored as poor (minimum), fair, good, or excellent (maximum) based on execution of specific micro-behaviors for brushing and flossing. Higher is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Count in S. Mutans Bacteria in Saliva at 1 month.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, and post-intervention (after about one month)</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva samples will be collected using Zymo collection kits to run qPCR analysis, which will yield information on whether or not bacteria is present (yes/no), and relative and absolute counts of S. mutans bacteria. Minimum is zero, no set maximum. Lower is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Count in S. sobrinus Bacteria in Saliva at 1 month.</measure>
