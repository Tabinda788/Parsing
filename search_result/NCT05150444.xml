  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of cognitive training combined with&#xD;
      physical exercise on cognitive function, physical performance and frailty indicators in the&#xD;
      hemodialysis population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis (HD) patients is extremely high.&#xD;
      Despite the well-documented benefits of interventions on cognitive function, there is a&#xD;
      widespread call for effective strategies that will show the long-term consequences in&#xD;
      patients undergoing dialysis. A randomized controlled intervention trial to examine the&#xD;
      effects of a combined non-pharmacological intervention in the form of intradialytic physical&#xD;
      exercise and intradialytic cognitive training on cognitive function, indicators of frailty,&#xD;
      and physical performance measures in HD patients will be conducted. The group of patients&#xD;
      receiving the study intervention will be compared to the control group receiving standard HD&#xD;
      care. The duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks (3 days a week). We will use&#xD;
      sensitive instruments (cognitive domain tests) to assess cognitive functions. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of the study at 12 weeks will be performance on the Alertness subtest of the&#xD;
      computerized Test of Attentional Performance. Secondary study outcomes will be: Performance&#xD;
      in other domains of cognitive function (executive function, psychomotor speed, information&#xD;
      processing efficiency, working memory, attention), physical fitness (10 repetition&#xD;
      sit-to-stand test, timed up and go test, handgrip strength test, spontaneous gait speed,&#xD;
      Stork balance test), and assessment of frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale). Study outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, immediately after the 12-week intervention, and six months after the&#xD;
      end of the study without specific further intervention (retention effect assessment). This&#xD;
      study will be among the first to test the synergistic effects of a uniquely designed physical&#xD;
      exercise and cognitive training intervention on functional status in HD patients. It is&#xD;
      believed that results will contribute to dementia prevention research by demonstrating the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of the presented combined intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline, after 12 weeks, after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Test of Attentional Performance (TAP) is a software package that can be used primarily to examine attention functions. The rationale for the selection of the main outcome: low learning effect, most probably affected by physical exercise, attention is one of the most affected cognitive domains in dialysis patients. From the TAP test battery, subtests Alertness, Selective attention, Divided attention, and Sustained attention will be included.</description>

    <description>Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) will be used to assess the psychomotor speed, efficiency of information processing, ability to switch between mental sets of the information and to maintain and manipulate information in working memory. It is a reliable and valid test for assessing information processing speed and efficiency and executive functioning domains.</description>

    <description>Performance of the sit-to-stand test involves activation of the lower limb muscles; the test measures lower limb strength. Participants are required to 10 times stand up from and sit down on an armless chair as quickly as possible. Their arms should be folded across their chest.</description>

    <description>This group will perform combined intradialytic cognitive and physical exercise training. First, they will exercise during dialysis (3 times a week; 12 weeks) for ~30 minutes on a customized ergometer. They will start with a 3-min warm-up, then the resistance will be implied to each individual according to the rate of perceived exertion of 4th to 5th grade on a 10-grade Borg scale. After a break, they will be given tablet computers in order to play &quot;brain games&quot; on a CogniFit platform (~30 - 45 min).</description>

    <description>12 weeks (3 times a week): patients will cycle on an adapted ergometer during their dialysis procedure. The exercise program will be run by kinesiologists. Participants will start with 15 minutes of cycling and then gradually increase the time and intensity. After the physical exercise session, they will continue with cognitive training. This training will be done on a tablet computer on a CogniFit platform (~30 minutes). The &quot;brain games&quot; on mentioned platform automatically adapt to individual cognitive abilities.</description>
