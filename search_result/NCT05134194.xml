  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 104 subjects with recurrent or metastatic IM triple negative breast cancer were&#xD;
      planned to be included in the study, and screened eligible subjects were randomly assigned in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to treatment with the combination of Camrelizumab and investigator's choice of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (test arm), treatment with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (control arm),&#xD;
      and the stratification factor was liver metastasis (with vs without). After enrollment,&#xD;
      subjects in the test group were treated with Camrelizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for one&#xD;
      cycle. The investigator's choice of single agent chemotherapy regimen (capecitabine,&#xD;
      eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine) was every 3 weeks for one cycle until disease&#xD;
      progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or discontinuation at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion.&#xD;
