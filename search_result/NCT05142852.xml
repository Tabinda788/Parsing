  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 40 patients poststroke (24 males) was randomly allocated to either ESWT&#xD;
      experimental (n=18) or conventional physiotherapy control group (n=20). All patients received&#xD;
      5 sessions during the treatment program. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Taiwan version&#xD;
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, and dynamometer (Maximal&#xD;
      grip strength) for each participant were assessed before and after the treatment program.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants in the experiment group received 5 consecutive sessions of ESWT for 5&#xD;
      minutes. Treatment parameters for the shock wave therapy group were set similar to a previous&#xD;
      study (Devrimsel et al., 2013) 2000 shock waves with 1.6 bar intensity and 16 Hz frequency&#xD;
      were applied for five sessions using the Swiss DolorClast Master (EMS, Nyon, Switzerland).&#xD;
      The participants in the control group received 5 sessions of conventional physical therapy&#xD;
      intervention for 5 minutes. The control group intervention consists of a 1-minute friction&#xD;
      massage over the common extensor tendon of the elbow, followed by 3 minutes therapeutic&#xD;
      ultrasound with a frequency of 1.5 Hz, and a 1-minute ice massage over the common extensor&#xD;
      tendon of the elbow. All participants used 10-cm lateral epicondyle bandages in the treatment&#xD;
      period, while none of them received analgesic or anti-inflammatory drugs and received&#xD;
      exercise programs.&#xD;

    <description>Participants were asked to rate their present pain intensity, as caused by the lateral epicondylitis, from zero to 10 using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper extremity disability and symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Upper extremity disability and symptoms at 5 day</time_frame>
    <description>Upper extremity disability and symptoms were evaluated using the Taiwan version Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire (Khoury, 2009). This 30-item questionnaire asks about the participants' ability to perform 21 various tasks, includes nine questions associated with symptoms on a 5-point scale, with the score of one representing no difficulty or no symptom and the score of five representing the inability to finish the task or severe pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline maximal grip strength at 5 day</time_frame>
    <description>The maximal grip strength of the involved arm was evaluated using a grip strength dynamometer (Exacta Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer, North Coast Medical Inc, Gilroy, CA). Participants were asked to grip the dynamometer as hard as possible three times at 10-second rest intervals in the sitting position, with 90 degrees of elbow flexion, the shoulder in adduction, the wrist in slight extension, and the forearm in neutral position. The highest grip strength number was recorded.</description>
