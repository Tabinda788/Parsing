  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic and debilitating urological&#xD;
      complex of disorders characterized by symptoms of bladder pain or discomfort, mostly upon&#xD;
      bladder filling, and often accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This study&#xD;
      will assess how safe and effective BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) is in treating IC/BPS. Adverse&#xD;
      events and change in disease symptoms will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of&#xD;
      Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS). Study doctors randomly assign the&#xD;
      participants to 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms to receive BOTOX or placebo. There is a&#xD;
      1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. Approximately 80 female&#xD;
      participants, aged 18 to 75 years, with a diagnosis of IC/BPS will be enrolled in&#xD;
      approximately 40 sites in the Unites States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive BOTOX or placebo injected into the bladder on Day 1 and followed&#xD;
      for at least 12 weeks in treatment 1. Eligible participants may request additional dose of&#xD;
      BOTOX between Weeks 12 and 24 and followed for 12 weeks in treatment period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests,&#xD;
      checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.&#xD;
