  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center phase II/III clinical study consisting of two stages: Stage I is a&#xD;
      single-arm open-label phase II study to preliminarily explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      SHR-1701 plus S-1 and oxaliplatin mainly by the endpoint of pCR rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase III study of SHR-1701 plus S-1 and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin versus placebo plus S-1 and oxaliplatin as perioperative treatment in subjects&#xD;
      with resectable GC or GEJC. A total of 846 treatment naïve subjects will be enrolled, and&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this stage is Independent Review Committee (IRC)-assessed EFS.&#xD;
