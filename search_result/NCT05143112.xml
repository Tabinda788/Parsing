  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical studies of CD19 CAR-T in r/r B-NHL have been extensively carried&#xD;
      out. At the beginning of 2020, MorphoSys submitted its company-targeted CD19 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody to the FDA for r/r DLBL treatment and obtained FDA priority approval. It further&#xD;
      confirms the safety and effectiveness of CD19 as a therapeutic target in r/r B-NHL. However,&#xD;
      these CAR-T cells are constructed from patients' autologous T cells, and the production and&#xD;
      preparation time is long; on the other hand, most patients have received multiple&#xD;
      chemotherapy before CAR-T treatment, and the quantity and quality of T cells often cannot&#xD;
      meet the needs of clinical treatment. It is also an important factor leading to the failure&#xD;
      of CAR-T cell therapy, which limits the large-scale clinical application of CAR-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cells sourced from healthy people are not only sufficient in quantity and quality&#xD;
      guaranteed, but also available at any time. In December 2020, lancet[2] reported a clinical&#xD;
      study of 19 patients receiving allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL. 14 patients were&#xD;
      evaluated as CR/CRi (67%) 28 days after treatment, with a median sustained remission Time 4.1&#xD;
      months. Allogeneic CAR-T cells are safe and effective for the treatment of B-cell malignant&#xD;
      diseases, and their clinical application range is expected to further improve the remission&#xD;
      rate and survival rate of patients with R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells enable T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells that&#xD;
      express specific antigens through genetic engineering. CD19 is expressed on the membrane&#xD;
      surface of pre-B cells and mature B cells, but not on the surface of T cells and normal&#xD;
      granulocytes. It is an ideal therapeutic target for B cell-derived tumors. A large number of&#xD;
      previous studies have confirmed that CD19 CAR-T cells are a safe and effective method for the&#xD;
      treatment of ALL. In 2019, Locke FL[1] et al. reported a clinical study of CD19 CAR-T for r/r&#xD;
      DLBL. 119 patients were enrolled. The objective response rate was 83%, the CR rate was 58%,&#xD;
      and the median progression-free survival was 5.9. Months. Greatly improved the patient's&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
