      This study was conducted to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criterion related validity of Rebee wearable sensor in measuring active flexion and&#xD;
      extension of knee joint ROM compared with digital goniometer measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-rater reliability of Rebee wearable sensor in measuring active flexion and&#xD;
      extension of knee joint ROM compared with digital goniometer measurement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Range of Motion (ROM) of the joint is one of the factors that determine function of the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system. This parameter should be measured and recorded by a valid and&#xD;
      reliable method . It is considered to be an essential component of lower limb physical&#xD;
      examination, which can be applied using various instruments such as goniometers and&#xD;
      inclinometers .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of motion of the knee joint is one of the major factors determining the outcome after&#xD;
      knee injuries. It is also an important measurement required by many knee scoring systems to&#xD;
      determine the preoperative status and postoperative outcome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements are used by physical therapists to quantify limitations of motion, it used to&#xD;
      decide an appropriate therapeutic interventions and document the effectiveness of these&#xD;
      interventions. The ideal measuring device should give reproducible valid and reliable data&#xD;
      .It is required an essential skill in the musculoskeletal assessments commonly performed by&#xD;
      physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-arm digital goniometer is still widely used in measuring uniaxial ROM of the joint of&#xD;
      extremity, there is high validity, intra- rater and inter-rater reliability of the digital&#xD;
      goniometer. It is considered valid and reliable tool that simplify physical therapists' work&#xD;
      .The digital goniometer is the most commonly utilized clinical tool for measuring joint range&#xD;
      of motion, the evolution of sensors technology and applications are easy to use, relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive, and highly accessible .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rebee is a wearable motion sensor package of sensor with its own mobile application, which&#xD;
      measures range of joint movement in different planes easily which the patient able to wear&#xD;
      the sensor and move easily to measure ROM and record the measurement at the application&#xD;
      software, that is facilitate the tele-measurement which the patients are supposed to put on&#xD;
      the sensors and perform the actions themselves, or with assistance from physical therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is lack in the literature about using Rebee wearable sensor in measuring the range of&#xD;
      knee joint so this study was conducted to test the criterion related validity and intrarater&#xD;
      reliability of the rebee wearable sensor in measuring active knee joint ROM compared with&#xD;
      digital goniometer measurement.&#xD;
