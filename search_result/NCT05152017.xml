  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study the safety, reactogenicity and obtain preliminary data on the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Flu-M Quadro, 4-valent inactivated split influenza vaccine, in healthy volunteers&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The maximum period of the volunteers' participation in the trial will be 35 ± 2 days.&#xD;
      Screening period - up to 7 days. The vaccine administration period is 1 day. Follow-up period&#xD;
      - 28±2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers are followed by a clinical investigator for 6 months after vaccination outside&#xD;
      of this trial with the aim of detecting possible late adverse reactions. If a volunteer has&#xD;
      any delayed-type reactions, the volunteer will be invited to the clinic for correction of&#xD;
      his/her condition.&#xD;
