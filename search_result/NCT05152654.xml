  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernias are one of the most common diseases in general surgery practice. In a&#xD;
      multicenter study conducted in Germany, inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common&#xD;
      operations. Until the last 20 years, after Lichtenstein described tension-free mesh hernia&#xD;
      repair, this method was the gold standard in inguinal hernia surgery. This method was&#xD;
      advantageous in terms of both less recurrence and less postoperative pain compared to tension&#xD;
      methods. With the development of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic hernia surgery was&#xD;
      first described by Dr. Ger in 1992. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is based on the&#xD;
      principles of preperitoneal repair described by Stoppa in open surgery. Its advantages over&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery are; Less post-operative pain, rapid recovery, reduction in nerve damage&#xD;
      and chronic pain, and reduced recurrence rate. However, the disadvantage is that the learning&#xD;
      curve is longer and higher cost. Two commonly used laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgeries are&#xD;
      Trans Abdominal Pre-Peritoneal (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) methods. Although&#xD;
      both are preperitoneal repair methods, less intraperitoneal organ damage, less&#xD;
      intra-abdominal adhesion formation, and no need for peritoneal sheath repair are the&#xD;
      advantages of the TEP method. For this reason, TEP method has been the preferred method&#xD;
      today. Various methods have been tried in order not to change the location of the mesh placed&#xD;
      in the TEP method. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia is one of the most debated issues. The most&#xD;
      common methods for fixation are tacker, tissue adhesive, or suturing the mesh. However,&#xD;
      fixing the mesh using a tacker can cause chronic pain. Tissue adhesives are not preferred&#xD;
      because tissue adhesives have high costs and sometimes cause allergic reactions. The method&#xD;
      in which the mesh is sewn to the pubic bone is avoided by surgeons because it prolongs the&#xD;
      operation time. To avoid chronic pain after surgery, the idea was not to fix the mesh. The&#xD;
      major drawback of this method is that the mesh may slip and cause recurrence.This study aimed&#xD;
      to reveal the difference between the amount of migration and the amount of post-operative&#xD;
      pain between detecting the mesh and not detecting it&#xD;

      The study will be conducted as a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study in&#xD;
      the general surgery clinic of a university hospital. As a result of the power analysis&#xD;
      calculated under Cohen's expert opinion, it was decided to include a total of 100 patients,&#xD;
      50 patients in order to reach 80% power with 0.50 effect size (medium effect) and 5% error&#xD;
      (alpha=0.05). in each group. The study will continue by taking the consent of the patients&#xD;
      and choosing from among the volunteer patients. The method by which the patients will be&#xD;
      operated will be determined by choosing from a total of 100 (50 per group) sealed envelopes&#xD;
      containing the group names. In the first (Fixation Group) group, inguinal hernia repair with&#xD;
      the TEP method will be fixed with a mesh stapler. While inguinal hernia repair is performed&#xD;
      with TEP method in the second (Non-Fixation Group) group, the mesh will not be fixed by any&#xD;
      method. Exclusion criteria; It was determined as being younger than 18 years of age, having a&#xD;
      comorbidity that prevented him from receiving general anesthesia, having had a previous lower&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, having undergone previous inguinal hernia surgery, having bilateral&#xD;
      inguinal hernia, scrotal hernia or strangulated hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of double blind; Patients will not be told which study group participants are in as&#xD;
      a result of the envelope participants choose. In the postoperative follow-up of the patients,&#xD;
      the researcher who recorded the parameters related to the study and provided the measurements&#xD;
      will not know which group the patients are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender, comorbidity, smoking history and body mass index of the patients will be&#xD;
      recorded on the preoperative forms. The surgery will be performed by a single surgeon&#xD;
      according to the group chosen by the patients. The performing surgeon was a general surgeon&#xD;
      with 5 years of active experience in laparoscopic hernia surgery and had performed both&#xD;
      methods more than 200 times. Until the end of the study, only the surgeon will know which&#xD;
      group the patients are in. The investigator evaluating the results of the study and the&#xD;
      performing surgeon will not communicate about the study.&#xD;

Patients with unilateral inguinal hernia will be determined according to the envelope selection method. Patients will not know which group are in.
