    <textblock>
      A two-stage trial will involve healthy volunteers. The first stage is open trial, and the&#xD;
      second stage is a double-blind trial with randomization of volunteers into three groups. At&#xD;
      stage I of the trial, the maximum number of screened healthy volunteers will be 30 of which&#xD;
      20 men aged 18 to over 60 years. At stage II of the trial, the maximum number of screened&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will be 150, of which 135 men and women aged 18 to over 60 years eligible&#xD;
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria are planned to be included and randomized&#xD;
      to collect data that will be used for the subsequent safety and immunogenicity assessment.&#xD;
      The enrollment of volunteers at stage II will be competitive.&#xD;
