  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HYBIS project aims to develop an innovative and unique hybrid Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)&#xD;
      system. This BCI system is envisioned as a novel tool for targeted reinforcement of sensory&#xD;
      motor coupling, specifically dedicated for upper-limb post-stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <description>Electrotactile BCI system accuracy is a measure of feasibility of the prototype device. Accuracy [0 -100 %] of classification of user's mental strategy (tactile attention task towards one of the two electrical stimulation hotspots), where higher values of accuracy are related to better system control.</description>

    <description>Motor Imagery BCI system accuracy is a measure of feasibility of the prototype device.&#xD;
Accuracy [0 - 100 %] of classification between rest and imaginary movement in a cue-based manner, , where higher values of accuracy are related to better system control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl Meyer sensory score for upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after experimental session</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl Meyer sensory score for upper extremity assesses the degree of sensory impairment in the upper arm. Sensation score ranges from 0 to 12 points, divided into 4 points for light touch and 12 points for position sense. Individual items pertaining to the light touch sensation of the upper arm/ forearm and palmary surface of the hand and to the position of the shoulder/ elbow/ wrist/ thumb (IP-joint) are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale and summed for a maximum possible score of 12. The higher score is considered to represent a less sensory deficit of the subject</description>

    <description>NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) method assesses workload on six scales for different aspects: mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration on a 21-point scale. A higher rating represents higher workload.</description>
