  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to learn whether participants find a patient guide to breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment decisions acceptable and appropriate for use.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to adapt and pilot test de-implementation strategies targeting low-value&#xD;
      breast cancer treatments which have persisted despite national recommendations. Breast cancer&#xD;
      is an ideal setting in which to study de-implementation given it is common, well-studied,&#xD;
      typically presents at an early-stage, and care is provided primarily in a community setting.&#xD;

    <measure>Acceptability of Intervention (AIM) Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after receiving decision aid</time_frame>
    <description>AIM is a validated, 4-item survey with all items measured on a 5-point Likert scale (Completely Disagree [1] - Completely Agree [5]), scored as a mean. The median score across all participants will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after receiving decision aid</time_frame>
    <description>IAM is a validated, 4-item survey with all items measured on a 5-point Likert scale (Completely Disagree [1] - Completely Agree [5]), scored as a mean. The median score across all participants will be reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement with the patient decision aid</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after receiving decision aid</time_frame>
    <description>To determine feasibility, participants will be asked whether they engaged with the patient decision aid (1=thoroughly, 2=somewhat or 3=not at all), scored as a mean. The median score across all participants will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with decision (SWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 120-days following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The SWD survey will be administered by telephone between 60- and 120-days following surgery. SWD is a validated, 6-item survey with all items measured on a 5-point Likert scale (Completely Disagree [1] - Completely Agree [5]), scored as a mean. The median score across all participants will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment choice</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The research team will access participants electronic medical records to determine the number of participants who underwent SLNB, radiation treatment, both or neither after surgery. This will be reported in 4 categories: Only SLNB, Only Radiation, Both or Neither.</description>
