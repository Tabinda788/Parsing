  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the hemostatic capacity of two types of collagen&#xD;
      hemostatic sponges in nail surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a randomized triple-blind clinical trial with two experimental groups (medium porosity&#xD;
      collagen and high porosity collagen) and control group ( non collagen).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate bleeding, all patients with onychocryptosis will be operated on with the same&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental groups, once the surgical procedure has been completed on both edges of&#xD;
      the nail, hemostatic collagen will be applied in the experimental groups (experimental group&#xD;
      1- medium porosity collagen and experimental group 2-high porosity collagen) In all groups,&#xD;
      including the control, once the intervention was finished, the same bandage was performed&#xD;
      with the same number of gauze pads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 72 hours, the gauze set will be removed to weigh it using a precision balance and&#xD;
      quantitatively evaluate the amount of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, a comparative study can be carried out between the 3 groups and determine if&#xD;
      there are statistically significant differences or not, and can determine if lyophilized&#xD;
      hemostatic collagen is useful in nail surgery and if there are significant differences&#xD;
      between both experimental groups, determining if the percentage of porosity in a hemostatic&#xD;
      is relevant in the hemostatic effect.&#xD;
