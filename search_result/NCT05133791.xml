  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is safety, tolerability and feasibility of systemic intravenous&#xD;
      injection of ANXV-800CW in patients with RVO in three dosing-cohorts in a phase I safety&#xD;
      study. Secondary objectives are to determine in the pre-mentioned dosing-cohorts the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of ANXV-800CW and to determine phosphatidylserine availability as&#xD;
      measured by flow cytometry in whole blood before and after ANXV-800CW administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective, mono-center safety/ feasibility dose&#xD;
      optimization study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients referred for (sub-)acute blurred vision with the diagnosis of RVO&#xD;
      aged 18-85 years, fertile females excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All patients will undergo a standard of care ophthalmological work-up to&#xD;
      establish the diagnosis of RVO. In the context of this study, Fluoresceine Angiography (FA)&#xD;
      will be added to the ophthalmological work-up for all patients. Furthermore, the patients&#xD;
      will receive a systemic single-dose injection of ANXV-800CW as part of a optimization study,&#xD;
      followed by NIR retinal fluorescence imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters studies are safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and feasibility of near-infrared fluorescent imaging in the retina of patients with RVO&#xD;
      related to the systemic injection of ANXV-800CW.&#xD;
