  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      68 De Quervain tenosynovitis(MPS) diagnosed patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups.&#xD;
      To groups; splinting+exercise+high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) and splinting+exercise+sham&#xD;
      HILT will be applied. Visual anolog scale (VAS) scores, quick Disabilities of the Arm,&#xD;
      Shoulder, and Hand (QDASH) questionnaire and Hand grip strength measurements of the patients&#xD;
      before-after treatment will be recorded and will be evaluated statistically.&#xD;

    <measure>quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QDASH) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The QDASH is a self-reported questionnaire that measures the physical functions and symptoms of patients with upper limb problems. It includes 11 items from the DASH survey, and to calculate the QDASH score, atleast 10 of the 11 items should be answered. Each item contains five answer options, and the total score of the scale is calculated from the individual item scores (0=no disability and 100=the most serious disability). The first eight items of the QDASH questionnaire measure the patient's daily life function and social activity limitations. The ninth question assesses the pain intensity, and the 10th question evaluates the feeling of &quot;pins and needles&quot; in the upper extremity. The last question is designed to evaluate the sleep problem due to pain.</description>

    <measure>JAMAR hydraulic hand dynamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength measurements will take with a JAMAR hydraulic hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN, USA) are known to provide reliable results and these measurements will be obtain while the patient will stand with a full extension of the elbow and wrist. Each patient will be asked to squeeze the dynamometer with full force for a maximum of three seconds. First on the healthy side and then on the effected side, three measurements will be taken, and the averages will be obtain.</description>

    <time_frame>10 Seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Visual anolog scale (VAS) A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a horizontal line, 100 mm in length measurement instrument that tries to measure the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain.</description>

    <description>In the HILT group, we will apply the device to the most painful area of the wrist in two phases. In both phase I and phase II, the laser will be applied using continuous circular movements.&#xD;
The first three sessions (phase I) will be used to provide analgesic effects at an intermittent phase, applying a 75 sec, 8 W, 6 J/cm2 treatment for a total of 150 J of energy. The subsequent six sessions (phase II) will provide a biostimulatory effect at a continuous phase, applying a 30 sec, 6 W, 120 to 150 J/cm2 treatment. The HILT will be applied for a total of nine treatment sessions over a period of three consecutive weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>high intensity laser therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Laser treatment is noninvasive and painless and can be easily administered in therapy units for a wide range of conditions. High-intensity laser therapy (HILT) has gained importance for the treatment of different kinds of sports injuries such as tendon injuries, contusions, and muscle spasms.</description>
