        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men or women aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presentation with anterior acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (&gt; 1 mm ST-segment&#xD;
             elevation in two or more contiguous leads between V1 and V4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The primary stented infarct-related lesion(s) must be in the proximal and/or mid-LAD&#xD;
             coronary artery (other lesions may be treated if clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Successful angioplasty within 6 hours of symptom onset, as documented by &lt;50% diameter&#xD;
             residual angiographic stenosis within all treated culprit lesions with TIMI 2 or 3&#xD;
             flow and no major complications such as perforation or shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient or their legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature&#xD;
             of the study, agrees to its provisions and has been provided and signed written&#xD;
             informed consent, approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;

             Oxygen Therapy is strictly contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Proximal coronary stenosis that would restrict flow with the SSO2 Catheter in place&#xD;
             (e.g., left main coronary artery stenosis &gt; 40%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of a post-intervention non-stented coronary dissection or perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Cardiac valvular stenosis or insufficiency, pericardial disease or non-ischemic&#xD;
             cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
