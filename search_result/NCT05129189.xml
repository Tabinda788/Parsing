  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In HIV-infected patients, enhanced PD-1 expression of T cells correlates with T cell&#xD;
      depletion, as evidenced by reduced virus-specific proliferative capacity and decreased&#xD;
      cytokine expression.Targeting PD-L1 drugs to block PD-1/PD-L1 signaling may promote the&#xD;
      secretion of antiviral cytokines and achieve HIV clearance.The mechanism of action of ASC22&#xD;
      is to competitively block the binding of PD-1 molecules to PD-L1 through its antigen-binding&#xD;
      region with a high affinity for hPD-L1, thereby stimulating an innate or adaptive immune&#xD;
      response with sustained T-cell activation.This study was conducted to evaluate whether ASC22&#xD;
      combined with chidamide in HIV-infected patients with antiviral suppression could shrink the&#xD;
      viral reservoir.&#xD;
