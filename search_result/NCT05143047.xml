  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to design and test the efficacy of a health-literacy-informed discharge&#xD;
      medication counseling intervention in the inpatient setting to reduce medication dosing&#xD;
      errors and improve adherence in hospitalized children discharged on a new liquid medication.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to improve discharge medication adherence and reduce medication&#xD;
      dosing errors following pediatric hospitalization. Medication errors are one of the most&#xD;
      common healthcare-associated adverse events in pediatrics, with approximately one&#xD;
      out-of-hospital medication error occurring every 8 minutes among children &lt; 6 years of age.&#xD;
      Liquid medications account for the majority of pediatric dosing errors which is likely due to&#xD;
      liquid medications' inherent dosing complexities, including the need for weight-based dosing,&#xD;
      different concentrations of medications, and parental use of unstandardized dosing&#xD;
      instruments. The increased stress and exhaustion that many caregivers experience during a&#xD;
      hospitalization, coupled with the need to assimilate large amounts of information pertaining&#xD;
      to post-discharge care, makes transitioning to home from an inpatient stay a particularly&#xD;
      high risk period for medication errors. Communication challenges, particularly failure to&#xD;
      consider caregiver health literacy, further compounds the risk for medication errors due to&#xD;
      poor caregiver comprehension and adherence to discharge instructions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During follow-up survey assessment 48-72 hours following patient/child discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will be asked to draw up a dose of their child's liquid medication using the provided oral dosing syringe and send a secure picture of the syringe via myCap (secure phone application designed to collect patient-centered outcomes for research studies) to research study staff. The primary outcome will be assessed as a continuous percent difference from the prescribed dose (in milliliters) documented in the electronic health record.</description>

    <description>Caregivers will be asked to report the prescribed volume (in milliliters) of medication to be given with each dose during the follow-up myCap survey. This will be compared to the prescribed dose in the electronic medical record.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver medication side effects comprehension</measure>

    <description>Caregivers will be asked in a follow-up survey to provide the medication side effects of their child's discharge medication. Caregivers will receive 1 point for every correctly identified side effect as it matches a list of pre-specified side effects determined by the study team. Caregivers will receive no points if they are unable to name any side effects on the prespecified list.</description>
