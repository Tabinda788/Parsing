  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of LTP001 in participants&#xD;
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to determine if LTP001 has an adequate clinical&#xD;
      profile to warrant further clinical development in this indication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-confirmatory, randomized, subject- and investigator-blinded, placebo controlled&#xD;
      study of LTP001 in PAH participants. Approximately 44 male and female adults with PAH&#xD;
      participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio of LTP001 active dose to placebo. Participants&#xD;
      will be screened for up to 8 weeks followed by 24 weeks of daily dosing with visits&#xD;
      approximately every 4 weeks. One follow up visit will also be the end of study visit and&#xD;
      occurs approximately 30 days after the end of treatment. Total study duration is&#xD;
      approximately 37 weeks from start of screening to end of study visit. If a participant&#xD;
      continues into the open-label extension study, then the follow-up visit may be skipped.&#xD;
