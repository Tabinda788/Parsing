  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to advance personalized, portable, and non-invasive hand-grasp&#xD;
      neuro-orthoses that restore naturalistic grasp functions for those with tetraplegia due to&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI), designed around their needs and preferences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Battelle has developed a novel wearable sleeve that can reanimate a paralyzed limb via&#xD;
      Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) that is controlled non-invasively by the user.&#xD;
      Previous work has shown the ability of this sleeve and FES technology to significantly&#xD;
      enhance independence and quality of life when controlled by an implanted brain-computer&#xD;
      interface, thus now investigators plan to trial use of the high-definition FES system with&#xD;
      simpler, non-invasive control mechanisms to expedite translation of this technology into&#xD;
      real-world settings. Each participant will complete up to 10 research sessions (~1.5hrs each)&#xD;
      in their residence or at an alternative Columbus Ohio location. Participants will be&#xD;
      compensated for their time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1, investigators will evaluate the ability of a non-invasive, user-controlled FES&#xD;
      system to increase functional hand use in the homes of individuals with SCI. The research&#xD;
      team will train participants to use the FES system for different functional hand movements&#xD;
      and activities they identify as important to them, then measure FES system effectiveness&#xD;
      using standardized assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 2, investigators will assess the viability of using the sleeve technology to&#xD;
      non-invasively record muscle activity as the participant attempts different functional&#xD;
      movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 3, human-centric design methodology and contextual inquiry interviews will be employed&#xD;
      to understand study participants' needs and preferences for a FES assistive device. This&#xD;
      information will determine actions to improve usability and optimize the system for&#xD;
      unsupervised home use.&#xD;
