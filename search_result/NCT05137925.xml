  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Mindfulness-Based Cognitive&#xD;
      Therapy in pregnancy to improve understanding of how and why this treatment modality enhances&#xD;
      well-being, which can then be leveraged to optimize treatment for psychological distress&#xD;
      emerging during this vulnerable period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and postpartum is a period of vulnerability for new or worsening psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms. Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an effective approach to mitigate&#xD;
      pregnancy-related worsening of psychological distress. However, prior research has focused&#xD;
      predominantly on symptoms of depression and anxiety, and is it not clear how or why MBCT&#xD;
      improves psychological health during the perinatal period. Thus, the goals of this project&#xD;
      are to (1) examine whether MBCT improves psychological functioning among pregnant women and&#xD;
      whether these improvements persist at three-months postpartum, (2) examine whether improved&#xD;
      ability to regulate emotions and behavior accounts for the beneficial effects of MBCT, and&#xD;
      (3) determine what demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors impact treatment&#xD;
      engagement and effectiveness.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the presence and severity of depressive symptoms from baseline to 8 weeks will be measured using the 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a widely used instrument validated in pregnancy and the postpartum period. Questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the EPDS are scored 0, 1, 2, or 3 with the top box scored as 0 and the bottom box scored as 3. Questions 3 and 5-10 on the EPDS are reverse scored with the top box scored as 3 and the bottom box scored as 0. Total scores on the EPDS are calculated by summing the score for each question. Total scores on the EPDS range from 0-30, with a score of 10 or greater indicating possible depression and higher scores indicating greater severity of possible depression.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mindfulness from baseline to 8 weeks will be measured using the 39-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). The FFMQ consists of five subscales, which are calculated by summing the following questions, which are scored 1-5 (questions followed by &quot;R&quot; are reverse scored 5-1): observing = questions 1, 6, 11, 15, 20, 26, 31, and 36; describing = 2, 7, 12R, 16R, 22R, 27, 32, and 37; acting with awareness = 5R, 8R, 13R, 18R, 23R, 28R, 34R, and 38R; nonjudging of inner experience = 3R, 10R, 14R, 17R, 25R, 30R, 35R, and 39R; nonreactivity to inner experience = 4, 9, 19, 21, 24, 29, and 33. For the FFMQ subscales, scores can range from 8 to 40, except for non-reactivity to inner experience, which can range from 7 to 35. For the FFMQ subscales, higher scores represent higher subscale levels of mindfulness. Total scores are calculated by summing the subscale scores and range from 39-195, with higher scores indicating higher overall levels of mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Change in disinhibition from baseline to 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in disinhibition from baseline to 8 weeks will be assessed by the Go/No-Go task (GNG). The GNG task is administered on the computer and asks participants to respond to visual stimuli that is presented continuously. Participants must make a motor response for the &quot;go&quot; stimulus and withhold a motor response for the &quot;no-go&quot; stimulus. The proportion of no-go targets in which an individual successfully withholds a motor response will provide a measure of response inhibition, with fewer errors indicating better response inhibition and a higher error rate indicating a greater tendency towards disinhibited behavior.</description>

    <description>Change in attention from baseline to 8 weeks will be assessed by the Stroop Color-Word Test. The Stroop Color-Word Test is a computerized task in which participants are required to name the color of a written color word while inhibiting the impulse to read the word itself. The difference between mean response times of correct responses on incongruent and control trials is used to compute an interference score, which provides a measure of attention, with lower scores indicating greater attentional deficits.</description>

    <description>Change in emotion regulation from baseline to 8 weeks will be measured using the 10-item Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The ERQ consists of two subscales, which are calculated by summing the following questions, which are scored 1-7 (none reverse scored): cognitive reappraisal = questions 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10; expressive suppression = questions 2, 4, 6, and 9. For the ERQ subscales, scores can range from 1-42, with higher scores indicating higher use of that particular emotion regulation strategy and lower scores indicating less frequent use.</description>

    <measure>Participant satisfaction at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction at 3 months will be measured quantitively with a 7-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ). Questions 1-3 on the CSQ assess participants' treatment satisfaction using a 10-point Likert scale. Questions 4-7 are opened-ended questions where participants can elaborate on their satisfaction with the treatment. Scores on questions 1-3 will be used to evaluate participant satisfaction and can range from 1-10. Total scores are calculated by summing the scores on questions 1-3 and can range from 3-30, with higher scores indicating greater participant satisfaction.</description>

    <description>Participant satisfaction will be measured qualitatively with brief qualitative interviews performed at the end of the intervention, during which participants will have the opportunity to comment on their experiences in the group in an open-ended format. Responses during the interview will be recorded and evaluated using a thematic analysis.</description>

    <measure>Engagement (attendance) at 8 weeks</measure>

    <measure>Engagement (homework) at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement will be assessed by the completion of daily homework as indicated by homework logs. Participants will be asked to practice mindfulness three days per week during the intervention period and will record the duration and type of meditation completed each day. Space will also be provided for participants to make note of anything they noticed about their practice. More frequent practice of mindfulness per week indicates higher levels of engagement.</description>

MBCT combines principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness meditation to help participants change the way in which they relate to automatic negative thinking patterns that trigger symptom recurrence. Through awareness and acceptance of negative thoughts and emotions, participants learn how to dismiss negative thoughts and to tolerate distress and uncertainty.</description>
