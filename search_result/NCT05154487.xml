    <textblock>
      This is a 2 stage multi-center study designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      alpelisib and fulvestrant in patients with PIK3CA-mutated ER-positive endometrioid&#xD;
      endometrial cancers by estimating the objective response rate (ORR). Treatment will continue&#xD;
      until either unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, or investigator/patient request&#xD;
      for withdrawal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have advanced (FIGO 2014 Stage III or IV), persistent, or recurrent&#xD;
             endometrial carcinoma, which is not likely to be curable by surgery or radiotherapy.&#xD;
             Histologic confirmation of recurrent disease is required. For cases of persistent&#xD;
             disease, histologic confirmation of the primary disease with radiologic evidence of&#xD;
             progression is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have endometrioid histology (all grades allowed) based on hysterectomy&#xD;
             or biopsy specimen and have positive expression of ER and oncogenic PIK3CA mutation&#xD;
             per criteria below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. PIK3CA mutations considered oncogenic include R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545X,&#xD;
             Q546X, M1043I, H1047X, or G1049R. The list of oncogenic mutations acceptable for&#xD;
             enrollment may be expanded as further information becomes available.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Oncogenic PIK3CA mutations identified on tests performed by the labs listed on&#xD;
             https://ecog-acrin.org/nci-match-eay131-designated-labs will be considered confirmed&#xD;
             for the purposes of this study ii. Oncogenic PIK3CA mutations identified by other&#xD;
             tests will need to be confirmed by the study prior to enrollment b. Estrogen receptor&#xD;
             (ER) status will be considered positive if ≥1% of tumor cells demonstrate positive&#xD;
             nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry. Pathology report documenting ER status must&#xD;
             be provided at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Sites are required to report results of previous MMR and/or MSI status testing in&#xD;
             Medidata Rave if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by RECIST&#xD;
             version 1.1. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each&#xD;
             lesion must be greater than or equal to 10mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper&#xD;
             measurement by clinical exam; or greater than or equal to 20mm when measured by chest&#xD;
             x-ray. Lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15mm in short axis when measured&#xD;
             by CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this&#xD;
             protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be&#xD;
             designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is&#xD;
             obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for Stage I, II, or III is permitted. Prior&#xD;
             chemoradiotherapy for a pelvic recurrence is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: No prior chemotherapy in the setting of Stage IV disease is permitted unless the&#xD;
             patient was without evidence of disease at the completion of chemotherapy and had a&#xD;
             least six months of progression-free survival since the completion of chemotherapy.&#xD;

             washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and&#xD;
             initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the&#xD;
             acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is required&#xD;
             between end of radiotherapy and initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
