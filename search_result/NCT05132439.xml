  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects over 20% of aged adults and is very common among&#xD;
      Veterans due significant tobacco use. PAD is due to the progressive blockage of peripheral&#xD;
      arteries, predominantly to the legs, and results in intermittent claudication (IC) or&#xD;
      recurrent muscle pain with activity secondary to insufficient blood supply. Those with PAD&#xD;
      and IC experience a progressive decline in walking and poor quality of life. There is no&#xD;
      effective medical treatment for PAD and IC. Metformin is a safe and effective treatment for&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes but it can also reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and improve energy&#xD;
      requirements as well as improve blood flow to the legs. Therefore, the investigators will&#xD;
      test the ability of Metformin to improve overall functional status, reduce PAD progression,&#xD;
      and reduce systemic inflammation in Veterans suffering from PAD and IC in a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo controlled trial: Metformin BenefIts Lower Extremities with Intermittent Claudication&#xD;
      (MOBILE IC) Trial. The success of this trial may identify a safe and effective treatment for&#xD;
      PAD and IC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a quadruple blinded randomized controlled trial. Therefore, the allocation of&#xD;
      participants to either placebo or metformin is unknown by the participant, research&#xD;
      personnel, investigator, or blinded statistician. A total of 200 participants will be&#xD;
      randomized over the course of 3 years. Study drug is administered to participants after all&#xD;
      inclusion and no exclusion criteria is confirmed, informed consent is completed, and they are&#xD;
      randomized. Study drug is continued throughout for 6 months following randomization.&#xD;
      Participants are prospectively observed and monitored for 12 months after randomization. The&#xD;
      patients' involvement (study visits/study phone calls) will last 12 months. Then, for 5&#xD;
      years, the study team will do a medical chart review as outlined in the ICF and protocol. All&#xD;
      main study endpoints are within the 12-month time point. Secondary endpoints including MACE&#xD;
      and MALE - major adverse cardiac and major adverse limb events - are time to event end points&#xD;
      which can continue beyond the 12-month study time frame and will inform not only the effect&#xD;
      of metformin on IC but also the natural history of IC among patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
