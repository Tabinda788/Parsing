    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multi-center, clinical&#xD;
      trial in which neonates diagnosed with Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: Active tAN + Morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: Sham tAN + Morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants will undergo Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) approach but will be managed by using the&#xD;
      Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS), recorded every three hours. Actual&#xD;
      treatment decisions made using the FNASS approach will be compared with predicted treatment&#xD;
      decisions based on recorded ESC evaluation.&#xD;

    <measure>Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7, Day 15, and Day 30 (or day of discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>The NNNS is a comprehensive and systematic assessment of an infant's response to a variety of items including handling, spontaneous behavior, motor activity and self-soothing as indicators of neurobehavioral performance. The NNNS examines neurobehavioral organization, neurological reflexes, motor development, active and passive tone, and signs of stress and withdrawal of the at-risk and drug-exposed infant. The NNNS document the range of withdrawal and stress behavior likely to be observed in intervention with substance-exposed infants. The scale consists of 13 domains: habituation, attention, arousal, regulation, handling procedures, quality of movement, excitability, lethargy, nonoptimal reflexes, asymmetric reflexes, hypertonicity, hypotonicity, and stress/abstinence scale. Summary scores are calculated and compared with percentile scores to determine how an infant compares with an at-risk sample. The NNNS has good psychometric properties and reliability.</description>

    <measure>Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 - Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>All infants will undergo ESC assessment every three hours after feeding (in line with FNASS). An infant will be considered well managed if the infant is able to eat &gt;1 oz per feed or breastfeed well, sleep undisturbed &gt;1 hour, and to be consoled, if crying, within 10 minutes. If the infant is eating &lt;1 oz per feed or not breastfeeding well, sleeping &lt;1 hour undisturbed, and/or is not consolable within 10 minutes, the morphine dose (predicted) will be increased by 0.01 mg/kg. Morphine dose (predicted) will be decreased by 0.04 mg per dose daily if the infant is considered well managed by the ESC standards. Due to its recent introduction, the safety and effectiveness of using ESC has yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, we will continue to use the FNASS to guide treatment decisions. However, treatment decisions made using the FNASS will be compared with predicted treatment decisions based on recorded ESC evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 - Day 30 (or day of discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS) is a validated assessment tool designed to measure 21 signs of withdrawal in infants. The tool provides a means to rate severity of withdrawal symptoms every three hours after feeding using a standard format.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 - Day 30 (or day of discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) is a validated pain scale utilized in the NICU. There are six components to the NIPS: facial expression, crying, breathing patterns, arm and leg movements, and state of arousal. The NIPS scale scoring ranges from 0-7, with scores greater than 3 indicating discomfort. A score of 3 is similar to the pain level associated with a heel stick procedure to obtain blood and the maximum score of 6 is similar to a circumcision procedure without analgesia. This measure will be taken immediately prior to, during, and after tAN therapy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Roo tAN Therapy System</intervention_name>
    <description>The Roo device will be placed in the left ear and programmed using a prespecified thresholding as follows. A trained study staff member will start tAN stimulation at an amplitude of 0.2 mA, a pulse width of 250 Î¼s, and frequency of 5 Hz in Region 1 (ABVN) and 100 Hz in Region 2 (ATN). The current intensity duty cycle will be set to run for 5 minutes with a 10 second off period. Perception intensity for each area is independent and will be determined by starting at 0.1 mA and increasing by 0.1 mA until the infant responds to stimulation, usually by eye blinking or head turn. After the infant responds to stimulation, the current intensity will be turned down by 0.1 mA. One hour prior to each planned morphine dose, the device will be set to run for 30 minutes. When the 30-minute tAN stimulation period is complete, the system will be turned off and unplugged. tAN will be administered up to four times per day for up to 20 days total.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the sham tAN group will have the earpiece applied and the cable connected to the patient controller, but stimulation will not be turned on. Thirty minutes of sham tAN will be delivered one hour prior to each planned morphine dose during the peak withdrawal period. tAN will be administered up to four times per day for up to 20 days total.</description>
