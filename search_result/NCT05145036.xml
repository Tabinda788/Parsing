  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia has been defined as a disease which presented as low muscles strength, low muscle&#xD;
      quantity or quality and low physical activity. The prevalence of sarcopenia is increasing&#xD;
      with the age and it is also included in one of geriatric syndromes. Several criteria have&#xD;
      been mentioned for diagnosis of sarcopenia, such as European Working Group on Sarcopenia in&#xD;
      Older People (EWGSOP)„ÄÅFoundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Consortium&#xD;
      Sarcopenia Project (FNIH) and Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In European, the prevalence rate of sarcopenia is 9.25-18%; 5-7% Canadian and 14.4% Taiwanese&#xD;
      elders have been diagnosed as sarcopenia, respectively. The sarcopenia has been found its&#xD;
      relationship with adverse outcomes of fall down, fracture, disability, and death. The&#xD;
      cytokines and decline in anabolic hormones play a role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. Tai&#xD;
      Chi exercise is one of Qigong and well-popular in Chinese population, and is helpful to&#xD;
      integration of body movements. Tai Chi exercise is less complicated and emphasized people's&#xD;
      awareness of self-care which presented the relationship between human and nature. Tai Chi&#xD;
      exercise could improve muscle performance, balance and have the benefit for fall down&#xD;
      prevention in the elders and patients with frailty. Furthermore, Tai Chi has been found that&#xD;
      it also could improve the muscle power and power strength in sarcopenic elders by team&#xD;
      training. Furthermore, immune makers of inflammation process have been noted their&#xD;
      diminishments by Qigong intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Tai Chi exercise in sarcopenic elders&#xD;
      through practicing at home. The differences of muscles strength, muscle quantity or quality&#xD;
      and physical activity after interventions would be recorded and analyzed. The cytokines&#xD;
      related to the sarcopenia process would also be sampled.&#xD;
