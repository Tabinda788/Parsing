  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial will establish the feasibility of a new digitized speech rehabilitation,&#xD;
      PATAKA, developed for patients with post-stroke dysarthria. For this study, participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to use the speech therapy app PATAKA for 30 minutes to 1 hour per day over a&#xD;
      4-week period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients with post-stroke dysarthria will be recruited and randomly divided&#xD;
      into intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will be instructed to receive speech treatments including&#xD;
      oro-motor exercise, phonation, articulation, resonance, syllable repetition, and reading&#xD;
      exercise (PATAKA App on mobile devices). Daily sessions will be provided during a 4-week&#xD;
      period. Both groups will also receive treatment as usual. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of mobile-based speech therapy in patients with dysarthria in the&#xD;
      acute phase following stroke.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the speech mechanism test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Speech mechanism screening tests will be used to measure the degree of dysarthria. The test consists of three categories; 1)evaluating the structure and function of the articulators, 2)phonation and articulation accuracy, and 3) articulation regularity and accuracy in the alternate motion rates and sequential motion rates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 will be used to assess depression. The PHQ-9 is a nine-item self-reported questionnaire for the measurement of depressive symptoms. Score ranges from 0 to 27, a lower score indicates less depressive severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety disorder-7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>GAD-7(Generalized Anxiety disorder-7) will be used to assess anxiety. The GAD-7(Generalized Anxiety disorder-7) is a seven-item self-reported questionnaire for screening and severity measuring of generalized anxiety disorder. Score ranges from 0 to 21, a lower score indicates lower anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Euro Quality of Life (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D will be used to assess the quality of life. The EQ-5D is a self-report questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life. The questionnaire consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, ordinary activities, discomfort, and mood state related to anxiety or depression. The responses record three levels of severity ('no problems', 'some problems', and 'extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NIHSS will be used to assess stroke-related neurologic deficit. The NIHSS scale is made up of 11 different elements that evaluate specific ability; level of consciousness (LOC), best gaze, visual field, facial palsy, motor arm, motor leg, limb ataxia, sensory, best language, dysarthria, extinction, inattention. Score ranges from 0 to 42 , a higher score indicates more severe stroke symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Computer Self-Efficacy Scale (mCES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>mCES will be used to assess participants' perceptions of self-efficacy for using a digitalized program. The mCES is a 10-item self-reported questionnaire. Score ranges from 0 to 100 , a higher score indicates a stronger sense of personal competence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Questionnaire (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SUS will be used to assess user's subjective views of a system's usability. SUS will only be used in the intervention group at the end of treatment. Score ranges from 0 to 100 , a higher score indicates the higher satisfaction level.</description>
