  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      [18F]F-AraG is a promising tracer to image activated T-cells with positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET). The aim of the ATTAIN trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of this novel tracer by performing a full kinetic modelling, assess&#xD;
      test-retest (TRT) variability and to correlate the tumor tracer uptake with the pathological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of immunotherapy and patient selection for combinatorial immunotherapy&#xD;
      strategies would greatly improve if the tumor microenvironment (TME) could be characterized&#xD;
      more accurately. Positron emission tomography (PET) using tracers that target immune cell&#xD;
      subsets may provide a non-invasive means to immune profile the TME. Imaging T-cells can help&#xD;
      in identifying 'hot' tumors, or parts of the tumor mass that have high concentrations of&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating T-cells and also provide information on its activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising tracer to image activated T-cells is [18F]F-AraG. Based on the hypothesis that&#xD;
      [18F]F-AraG will accumulate in activated T-cells, it is expected that [18F]F-AraG and PET&#xD;
      will enable to (reproducibly) identify tumors and tumor areas with high concentrations of&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating activated T-cells on pathological assessment. In the ATTAIN trial this&#xD;
      [18F]F-AraG uptake in tumor lesions and healthy organs is explored by full kinetic modelling.&#xD;
