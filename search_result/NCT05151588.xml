  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma is very locally advanced malignancy at diagnosis which&#xD;
      often precluded upfront radical resection. We are now proposing a phase II single-arm study&#xD;
      on tazemetostat in combination with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU (known as TPF regimen) as&#xD;
      preoperative therapy for locally advanced non-metastatic SMARCB1 (INI-1)-deficient sinonasal&#xD;
      carcinoma, followed by radical resection and/or post-operative radiation therapy (with or&#xD;
      without concurrent chemotherapy), and tazemetostat for another 6 months. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      addition of tazemetostat will improve objective response rate, resectability rate, orbit&#xD;
      preservation rate after surgery (, and hopefully survival outcomes with manageable safety&#xD;
      profiles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SMARCB1 (INI-1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma is a rare but locally aggressive malignancy of&#xD;
      the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, representing about only 1 % of all head and neck&#xD;
      malignancies. It is characterized by loss of INI-1 in the tumour cells under&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining. The overwhelming majority of INI-1 deficient sinonasal&#xD;
      carcinoma presents very late at diagnosis, owing to its very similar clinical presentation to&#xD;
      other benign conditions like allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis, and some&#xD;
      more common malignancies like human papilloma virus-associated squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      extranodal NK/T cells lymphoma, mucosal melanoma. Therefore, complete surgical removal&#xD;
      remains very challenging and most of the time impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, aggressive multimodality treatment of INI-1-deficient sinonasal carcinomas is&#xD;
      based on experience with other sinonasal malignancies including case series of sinonasal&#xD;
      undifferentiated carcinoma. Upfront surgical resection for potentially resectable cases,&#xD;
      followed by adjuvant radiation therapy or adjuvant chemoradiation. Also under investigation&#xD;
      is the use of induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant radiation in the&#xD;
      treatment of sinonasal malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the above, we are now proposing a phase II single-arm study on tazemetostat in&#xD;
      combination with TPF as preoperative therapy for locally advanced non-metastatic SMARCB1&#xD;
      (INI-1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma, followed by radical resection and/or post-operative&#xD;
      radiation therapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy), and tazemetostat for another 6&#xD;
      months. We hypothesize that addition of tazemetostat will improve objective response rate,&#xD;
      resectability rate, orbit preservation rate, and hopefully survival outcomes with manageable&#xD;
      safety profiles.&#xD;
