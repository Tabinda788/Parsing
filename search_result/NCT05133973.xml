  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single centered, prospective, double blinded study enrolling 12 Type I diabetic patients (+&#xD;
      up to 4 replacements) in two cohorts. Patients will wear multiple FiberSense CGM systems for&#xD;
      28 days, with total duration of the participation up to 8 weeks (screening + active phase +&#xD;
      follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of the study are assessment of the safety and tolerability of the FiberSense&#xD;
      CGM system during the wearing time together with characterization of the system performance&#xD;
      when compared to capillary blood samples.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FiberSense system is intended to be used by diabetic patients in a home use setting as a&#xD;
      CGM system using the interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose as an indicator of blood glucose&#xD;
      levels.The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of FiberSense system across the&#xD;
      glucose measurement ranges as compared with a laboratory standard reference method in&#xD;
      diabetic patients (Type I) during in-clinic glucose challenge sessions. At the same time and&#xD;
      also at home use the blood glucose values are recorded by comparator system and&#xD;
      self-monitoring blood glucose system (SMBG). The safety aspects are also investigated during&#xD;
      the wearing time of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two cohorts differ in the measurement scheduled, with intensive measurement week either&#xD;
      at week 1 (cohort A) or week 2 (cohort B).&#xD;
