  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common pulmonary manifestation of idiopathic&#xD;
      inflammatory myopathy (IIM). The overall 5-year mortality is 50%. The prognosis is poor and&#xD;
      the treatment is challenging.At present, according to the consensus of IIM-ILD experts,&#xD;
      glucocorticoids as first-line treatment are often used in high doses and have a variety of&#xD;
      adverse reactions. Previous studies have shown that cyclophosphamide (CYC) is effective for&#xD;
      IIM-ILD and tends to be used in rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease（RP-ILD）or&#xD;
      refractory ILD. However, CYC is an alkylating agent with many toxic and side effects. It is&#xD;
      prone to gonadal inhibition, infection, tumor, hemorrhagic cystitis and other risks. At&#xD;
      present, Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been widly used in the treatment of IIM, systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus (SLE), ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV). The observational research on&#xD;
      MMF in the treatment of IIM-ILD shows that it can delay the progress of pulmonary fibrosis&#xD;
      and can be used as the first-line treatment of IIM-ILD. Moreover, immune tolerance caused by&#xD;
      defects in the number and/or quality of regulatory T cells (Treg) is considered to be a key&#xD;
      source of autoimmune diseases. However, it is unclear whether MMF can improve the immune&#xD;
      status of IIM-ILD by increasing Treg cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of MMF for IIM-ILD and its effcts on Treg through a prospective open single arm study, and&#xD;
      provide a theoretical basis for the individualized treatment of IIM-ILD, which has important&#xD;
      clinical significance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common pulmonary manifestation of idiopathic&#xD;
      inflammatory myopathy (IIM), with an incidence ranging from 23.1 to 65%. The treatment of IIM&#xD;
      patients with ILD is challenging, and the overall 5-year mortality is 50%. The disease&#xD;
      process of ILD from stable or slow to rapid. Increased mortality and poor prognosis were&#xD;
      observed, which needs active treatment. At present, according to the consensus of IIM-ILD&#xD;
      experts, glucocorticoids as first-line treatment are often used in high doses, but have a&#xD;
      variety of adverse reactions. Previous studies have shown that cyclophosphamide (CYC) is&#xD;
      effective for IIM-ILD and tends to be used in rapidly progressive interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease（RP-ILD）or refractory ILD. However, CYC is an alkylating agent with many toxic and&#xD;
      side effects. It is prone to gonadal inhibition, infection, tumor, hemorrhagic cystitis and&#xD;
      other risks. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been widly used in the treatment of IIM,&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV). The observational&#xD;
      research on MMF in the treatment of IIM-ILD shows that it can delay the progress of pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis and can be used as the first-line treatment of IIM-ILD. Moreover, immune tolerance&#xD;
      caused by defects in the number and / or quality of regulatory T cells (Treg) is considered&#xD;
      to be a key source of autoimmune diseases. In transplant patients, studies have found that&#xD;
      the combination of MMF and tacrolimus can increase the number of Treg cells in peripheral&#xD;
      blood, suggesting that MMF has a certain regulatory effect on Treg cells. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      unclear whether MMF can improve the immune status of IIM-ILD by increasing Treg cells, so as&#xD;
      to improve the prognosis of the disease. However, it is unclear whether MMF can improve the&#xD;
      immune status of IIM-ILD by increasing Treg cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of MMF for IIM-ILD and its effcts on Treg through a prospective open single arm study,&#xD;
      and provide a theoretical basis for the individualized treatment of IIM-ILD.This was a&#xD;
      single-arm open-label pilot observational study. Patients were received prednisone&#xD;
      (0.5mg-1.0mg/kg/d ) combined with MMF(1.5g-2.0g/d) for 12 months, 4 weeks later, reduced 5mg&#xD;
      every two weeks to 10mg/d orally for 3 months, gradually reduced to 7.5mg/ day until 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
