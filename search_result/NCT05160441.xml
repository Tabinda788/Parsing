      Shoulder arthroplasty provides successful improvement in pain and function for the treatment&#xD;
      of end stage osteoarthritis (OA) of the shoulder in the older patient population (Sanchez&#xD;
      2008, Sampson 2010, Kon 2012, Fitzpatrick 2017). However, the optimal non-operative treatment&#xD;
      for shoulder OA in the young active duty and civilian populations has yet to be determined.&#xD;
      Although corticosteroid injections (CSI) are a viable option with diagnostic and short-term&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit in glenohumeral OA, steroid does little to address the underlying&#xD;
      pathology and confers risk of adjacent tendon failure (Kon 2009, Gosens 2011, Monto 2014,&#xD;
      Tietze 2014). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derived from autologous blood, however, has the&#xD;
      potential to enhance soft tissue healing as previously observed in muscles and tendons&#xD;
      (Sanchez 2005, Randelli 2008, Hall 2009). PRP contains growth factors purported to safely&#xD;
      facilitate local tissue regeneration as corroborated in multiple clinical studies&#xD;
      investigating tendinopathy (Virchenko 2006, Kesikburun 2013, Fitzpatrick 2017, Schwitzguebel&#xD;
      2019). PRP is a promising concept to bridge the gap between conventional non-operative&#xD;
      measures and surgical arthroscopy or arthroplasty options in a high functioning patient&#xD;
      population with refractory disease. However, clinical literature elucidating the effects of&#xD;
      intra-articular leukocyte-poor PRP (LP-PRP) injections in large joint degenerative OA has&#xD;
      been slower to emerge, lacking substantiated data due to small sample sizes and treatment&#xD;
      variability. Therefore, high level evidence-based studies remain critical in ascertaining the&#xD;
      therapeutic value and clinical efficacy of LP-PRP in glenohumeral OA in order to establish&#xD;
      standard of care protocols and guide systematic implementation.&#xD;

      Shoulder arthroplasty provides successful improvement in pain and function for the treatment&#xD;
      of end stage osteoarthritis (OA) of the shoulder in the older patient population (Sanchez&#xD;

      measures and surgical arthroscopy or arthroplasty options in a high functioning patient&#xD;
      population with refractory disease. However, clinical literature elucidating the effects of&#xD;

      therapeutic value and clinical efficacy of LP-PRP in glenohumeral OA in order to establish&#xD;
      standard of care protocols and guide systematic implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although commonly used corticosteroid injections have shown some clinical benefit, there are&#xD;
      known deleterious effects from steroid use, which include accelerated osteoarthritis&#xD;
      progression, cartilage toxicity, and increased risk of septic arthritis. In addition to this,&#xD;
      multiple studies demonstrate corticosteroids confers risk of adjacent tendon failure (Kon&#xD;
      2009, Gosens 2011, Monto 2014, Tietze 2014). There is also a concern that multiple&#xD;
      corticosteroid injections increase the risk of fat atrophy, skin pigment changes, and tissue&#xD;
      thinning if placed incorrectly in the more superficial tissue of the shoulder. These negative&#xD;
      findings associated with corticosteroid injections have prompted ongoing research into&#xD;
      alternative orthobiologic treatments that provide short to medium duration benefit for&#xD;
      patients with osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, Leukocyte-Poor Platelet-Rich Plasma (LP-PRP), derived from autologous blood, has&#xD;
      demonstrated safety and efficacy in multiple pre-clinical, randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials, and meta-analysis studies in the other large joints, causing slow acceptance in the&#xD;
      medical community to utilize this as a treatment option, despite its increased cost compared&#xD;
      to corticosteroid injection (Campbell 2015, Cavallo 2014, Lai 2015, Laudy 2015, Patel 2013,&#xD;
      Smith 2016, Tietze 2014, Piuzzi 2019). However, clinical literature elucidating the effects&#xD;
      of intraarticular leukocyte-poor PRP (LP-PRP) injections in shoulder joint degenerative OA&#xD;
      has been slower to emerge, lacking substantiated data due to small sample sizes and treatment&#xD;
      variability. Therefore, high level evidence-based studies remain critical in ascertaining the&#xD;
      therapeutic value and clinical efficacy of LP-PRP in glenohumeral OA in order to establish&#xD;
      standard of care protocols and guide systematic implementation. PRP is a promising concept to&#xD;
      bridge the gap between conventional non-operative measures and surgical arthroscopy or&#xD;
      arthroplasty options in a high functioning patient population with refractory disease.&#xD;

    <description>The SANE score is a validated patient reported outcome measure. It is a single question score that asks, &quot;how would you rate your condition today as a percentage of normal (0% to 100% scale with 100% being normal)?&quot; The SANE score is collected as standard of care.</description>

    <description>The VR-12 comprises 12 questions that correspond to eight domains of health, including general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations because of physical problems, role limitations because of emotional problems, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, and mental health.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-injection (baseline) and then post-injection at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WOOS is a patient-administrated, disease-specific questionnaire for measurement of the quality-of-life of patients with osteoarthritis.7 It provides scores on four domains: (1) physical symptoms; (2) sport, recreation, and work; (3) lifestyle; and (4) emotions. Each question is answered using a visual analog scale with a possible score ranging from 0 to 100. There are 19 questions, and the total score ranges from 0 to 1900. A score of 1900 signifies that the patient has an extreme decrease in the shoulder-related quality of life, whereas a score of 0 signifies that the patient has no decrease in shoulder-related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Testing the range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder in different directions. If movement in a specific direction is painful or limited, this may signify that pathology is present in a specific structure of the shoulder. Common ROM tests include: forward flexion, abduction, cross-body adduction, external rotation, extension, internal rotation, scapular motion</description>
