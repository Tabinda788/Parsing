  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) surgery is a type of bariatric surgery (BS) which is&#xD;
      gaining popularity worldwide and is considered to be a simple, safe and effective bariatric&#xD;
      procedure in terms of weight loss and comorbidities resolution. However, only limited data&#xD;
      exists on the nutritional and gastrointestinal (GI) consequences of this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to gain information on GI and nutritional parameters from a large sample of&#xD;
      OAGB patients living in 3 different countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-OAGB patients across Israel (n=277), Spain (n=105) and Portugal (n=111) were recruited&#xD;
      to the study based on the time elapsed since surgery [1-6 months (1-6M), 6-12 months (6-12M)&#xD;
      and 1-5 years (1-5Y) post-surgery]. Participants were asked to complete an anonymous survey&#xD;
      delivered by SurveyMonkey®️ software which included data on demographics, comorbidities,&#xD;
      anthropometrics, GI outcomes and satisfaction with the procedure.&#xD;
