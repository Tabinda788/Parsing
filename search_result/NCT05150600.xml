      Background and Objectives: Maintaining oxygenation during neonatal open repair of esophageal&#xD;
      atresia is difficult. Inverse ratio ventilation can be used during one lung ventilation (OLV)&#xD;
      to improve the oxygenation and lung mechanics. The investigators will compare inverse ratio&#xD;
      to conventional ratio ventilation during OLV in neonatal open repair of esophageal atresia&#xD;
      regarding effect in oxygenation, hemodynamic variables, incidence of complications, and&#xD;
      easiness of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will enroll 40 term neonates undergoing open right thoracotomy for&#xD;
      esophageal atresia repair in this prospective randomized study. The patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into 2 groups based on inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation parameters (I:E ratio will be 2:1 in IRV and 1:2 in CRV). The incidence of&#xD;
      desaturation episodes that needs to stop the procedure and reinflation of the lung will&#xD;
      recorded as the primary outcome while hemodynamic parameters, incidence of complications, and&#xD;
      length of surgical procedure will be recorded as the secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining adequate oxygenation after lung retraction and one lung ventilation (OLV) in open&#xD;
      thoracotomy during neonatal repair of esophageal atresia/ tracheoesophageal fistula is&#xD;
      extremely difficult and usually required stopping the procedure and reinflation of the&#xD;
      retracted lung which prolong the surgery time, stopping the procedure during critical&#xD;
      situations and endanger the fragile neonate from hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inverse ratio ventilation has been used originally for long time in patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to improve the oxygenation and lung function. The&#xD;
      mechanism with inverse ratio ventilation is to prolong the inspiratory time with reducing the&#xD;
      airway pressure and elevate the mean airway pressure preventing the alveoli from collapse.&#xD;
      Also inverse ratio ventilation (IRV) used in many studies in adults during OLV with better&#xD;
      oxygenation and lung mechanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the standard ventilatory sitting in neonatal anesthesia is to adjust the inspiratory&#xD;
      time to achieve inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2 to 1:3, but inverse I:E ratio&#xD;
      (with inspiratory time longer than expiratory time) up to 4:1 in neonatal mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation has been shown to be effective in improving oxygenation, PaO2, and gas&#xD;
      distribution in atelectatic lungs. Inverse I:E ratio in neonatal mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      should be used in caution and for a short period of time to avoid possible complications as&#xD;
      air trapping/auto PEEP, volutrauma, air leaks, decrease venous return, and increase pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM/ OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the incidence of desaturation episodes that needs to stop the procedure and&#xD;
           reinflation of the lung using inverse ratio ventilation versus conventional ratio&#xD;
           ventilation during one lung ventilation in neonatal open repair of esophageal&#xD;
           atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of inverse ratio ventilation on hemodynamic parameters,&#xD;
           incidence of complications, and length of surgical procedure as compared to conventional&#xD;
           ratio ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at Ain Shams University Hospitals after ethical committee&#xD;
      approval and obtaining an informed written consent from patients' parents or legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of Study Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Setting Pediatric surgery operating theatre in Ain shams university hospital,&#xD;
           Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Period The study will be started immediately after ethical committee approval&#xD;
           starting from October 2021 aiming to be completed within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion Criteria: The patients will be of ASA physical status II-III, neonates&#xD;
                aged less than 28 days and undergoing open repair of esophageal atresia/&#xD;
                tracheoesophageal fistula with right thoracotomy. All patients' will be full term&#xD;
                with gestational age ≥ 36 weeks and weigh ≥ 2.5 kilograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exclusion Criteria: Significant congenital heart disease including cyanotic heart&#xD;
                disease, single ventricle pathology, large intracardiac defect with significant&#xD;
                left to right shunt, and severe pulmonary hypertension more than 50 mmHg. Other&#xD;
                exclusion criteria included prematurity, pneumonia or severe chest infection prior&#xD;
                to the surgery, and parent or guardian refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampling Method Based on inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio used in positive pressure&#xD;
           ventilation, patients will be randomly and evenly assigned to one of two groups (20&#xD;
           patients each) using a computer-generated list: experimental group IRV (inverse ratio&#xD;
           ventilation) and control group CRV (conventional ratio ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group IRV: the I:E ratio in this group will be 2:1 with the maximum inspiratory time (Ti) of&#xD;
      1.3 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group CRV: the I:E ratio in this group will be 1:2 with the minimum inspiratory time (Ti) of&#xD;
      0.4 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample Size Sample size was calculated using PASS 11.0 and based on a study carried out&#xD;
           by Son et al., 2020. Group sample size of 20 patients in Group one and 20 patients in&#xD;
           Group two achieve 82% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of&#xD;
           0.4000. The proportion in group one (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.1000 under&#xD;
           null hypothesis and 0.5000 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in group two&#xD;
           (the control group) is 0.1000. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test with&#xD;
           pooled variance. The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.0500. The&#xD;
           significance level actually achieved by this design is 0.0361. The sample size was&#xD;
           inflated by 10% to account for attrition problem in prospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical Considerations After acquiring local medical ethics committee approval and&#xD;
           informed written consent from the parent or guardian, The investigators will enroll 40&#xD;
           patients in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Tools AND/ OR Study Procedures AND/OR Study Interventions All included patients&#xD;
           will be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and kept Nil Per Os (NPO) after&#xD;
           establishing the diagnosis of esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula, had a&#xD;
           secured venous access and received dextrose containing intravenous fluid according to&#xD;
           the orders given by the neonatologist. An umbilical artery catheter will be inserted by&#xD;
           the neonatologist prior to the surgery, also an orogastric tube (OGT) will be inserted&#xD;
           in the proximal esophageal pouch and a low negative pressure suction will be applied to&#xD;
           suck any secretions in the esophagus and decrease risk of aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another intravenous (iv) cannula will be inserted after induction of anesthesia and a femoral&#xD;
      22 gauge (G) arterial line will be inserted in any patient without an umbilical artery&#xD;
      catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After applying standard monitors (non-invasive blood pressure, 5-lead ECG and 2 pulse&#xD;
      oximetry; one pre-ductal and one post-ductal, 2 temperature probes; one oropharyngeal and one&#xD;
      axillary), anesthesia induction will be started with inhalational anesthetics sevoflurane 2%&#xD;
      in 100% oxygen and increasing gradually till end-tidal sevoflurane reach 4-6% with&#xD;
      maintaining spontaneous breathing to avoid gastric distension with positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (PPV) then tracheal intubation will be facilitated with lidocaine 10% topical&#xD;
      spray one puff applied to the glottic opening just before insertion of 3 or 3.5 mm non-cuffed&#xD;
      endotracheal tube (ETT), then ETT will be fixed just above the tracheal carina (confirmed by&#xD;
      auscultation -the ETT will be initially pushed endobronchial then gradually withdrawn till&#xD;
      bilateral breath sound heard- and absence of gastric distension with gentle positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ensure the correct position of ETT just above the carina and below the&#xD;
      tracheoesophageal fistula and the patient hemodynamically stable, positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation will be started after establishing muscle relaxation with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 1-2% in oxygen/air mixture and fentanyl&#xD;
      infusion of 1-2 mcg/kg/h. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) will be maintained to the lower&#xD;
      limit to keep oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 92% with minimum FiO2 of 0.3. IV fluids will be&#xD;
      maintained as preoperative rate with boluses of normal saline will be given to replace blood&#xD;
      loss and third space loss. Blood transfusion will be given in cases lost more than 10% of&#xD;
      their total blood volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient will be mechanically ventilated with synchronized intermittent mandatory&#xD;
      ventilation-pressure controlled ventilation (SIMV-PCV) mode with the following parameters;&#xD;
      peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 10-15 cmH2O above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of&#xD;
      5 cmH2O to achieve expired tidal volume (VTE) from 7-10 ml/kg, Respiratory rate (RR) ranging&#xD;
      from 30 to 50 breath/minute to achieve end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) from 30 mmHg up to 50 mmHg, and&#xD;
      pressure support (PS) 12 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same pediatric surgery team will perform all procedures. After positioning of the patient&#xD;
      in the right lateral position, the right hemithorax will be opened then the right lung will&#xD;
      be retracted to expose and ligate the fistula then end to end esophageal anastomosis will be&#xD;
      performed. The right lung will be re-inflated under direct vision to ensure full lung&#xD;
      expansion after finishing of esophageal anastomosis then the right hemithorax will be closed&#xD;
      with chest tube in situ. Patients in IRV group will resumed conventional I:E ratio&#xD;
      ventilation after resuming two lungs ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic variables including heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) will be recorded: baseline (before induction of anesthesia), before&#xD;
      initiation of PPV, after the initiation of PPV, after initiation of OLV and every 10 min&#xD;
      until the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of hypotension (as the lower limit of normal mean BP on the day of birth, in&#xD;
      mmHg, is approximately equal to the gestational age in weeks, so hypotension considered if&#xD;
      MAP is less than the gestational age in weeks); and bradycardia (defined as: HR&lt; 90&#xD;
      beats/min, as the lower limit of normal HR in sleeping neonate is 90 beats/min) or hypoxemia&#xD;
      (oxygen saturation less than 90%) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of hypotension, the patient will be treated initially with an IV fluid bolus of&#xD;
      10-20 ml/kg normal saline over 5-10 minutes. In case of estimated blood loss exceeded 10% of&#xD;
      TBV, transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) of 10-15 ml ml/kg over 10-20 minutes will&#xD;
      be given. If the hypotension persisted despite of volume loading, dopamine IV infusion will&#xD;
      be used in dose range 5-10 mcg/kg/min until the blood pressure normalize. Bradycardia will be&#xD;
      treated initially with stopping the surgery and manual reinflation of right lung if&#xD;
      associated with hypoxia and if persisted or not related to hypoxia will be treated with&#xD;
      intravenous atropine 0.02 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a drop in oxygen saturation of less than 90%, the FiO2 and the PEEP will be&#xD;
      increased to 1 and 7 cmH2O respectively, and if desaturation persist, the surgery will be&#xD;
      stopped with manual reinflation of right lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of stopping the procedure for manual reinflation of the lung will be recorded,&#xD;
      also the length of the surgical procedure starting from skin incision till skin closure will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood gases (ABG) sample will be done two times during the procedure; first one&#xD;
      after established positive pressure ventilation by 10 minutes and before the surgical&#xD;
      incision, the second sample will be done after established OLV by 10 minutes but not during&#xD;
      desaturation episode. SaO2, PO2 and PCO2, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the procedure, patients will be transferred to the NICU intubated,&#xD;
      ventilated and sedated. In the NICU chest X-ray will be performed immediately after patient&#xD;
      arrival to exclude pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of complications including desaturation episodes that needs only increase FiO2&#xD;
      and/or PEEP, desaturation episodes that needs stop the procedure with lung reinflation,&#xD;
      hypotension, bradycardia, hypercapnia, needs for vasopressor and blood loss exceeding 10%&#xD;
      from TBV will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative and postoperative data will be collected by the an anesthesia resident not&#xD;
      participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Analysis Numerical data are presented as the mean (standard deviation) or&#xD;
           median (range) while categorical data are presented as the number of cases (percentage).&#xD;
           Between-group comparisons of numerical variables will be performed by the independent&#xD;
           sample T-test, or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate, while those of categorical variables&#xD;
           will be performed by the Chi-square test. For all tests, a P (probability) value &lt; 0.05&#xD;
           will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Package The data collected will be analyzed with statistical program SPSS&#xD;
           (version 22.0 Chicago, Illinois, USA).&#xD;
