  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are unfortunately common and the known outcomes are&#xD;
      concerning. However, very little is currently know about programs that may prevent ACEs among&#xD;
      children such as witnessing IPV experienced by their caregivers. The purpose of this project&#xD;
      is to adapt an existing evidence-based program (i.e., Strengthening Families) to prevent&#xD;
      ACEs. A randomized control will be used to determine the initial efficacy of the program. The&#xD;
      Strengthening Families program has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing substance use and&#xD;
      initiation among youth and some preliminary evidence suggests that it may be effective at&#xD;
      reducing child maltreatment as well. Further, the Strengthening Families program promotes&#xD;
      family bonding and cohesion, which are protective factors against ACEs. The Strengthening&#xD;
      Families program has been adapted by researchers at UNL (Devan Crawford and Les Whitbeck) for&#xD;
      Native American Families (i.e., BII-ZIN-DA-DE-DAH [Listening to One Another]) to prevent&#xD;
      substance abuse. Using the Strengthening Families and BII-ZIN-DA-DE-DAH programs, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to adapt these programs to prevent ACEs among youth ages 10-14 and their&#xD;
      caregivers. The program adaptations are being led by a Community Advisory Board as well as&#xD;
      community practitioner partners. The community has named the program Tiwahe Wicaghwicayapi&#xD;
      (Lakota for: to strengthen/improve families). Native children and/or children living in&#xD;
      poverty, ages 10 to 14, will participate in the program with their families. Half of the&#xD;
      families will go first and then the second half of the families will get the program after&#xD;
      the last survey. The investigators will use surveys to see if and how the program is working&#xD;
      and also interview some people who go through the program. A community Advisory Board is&#xD;
      involved in all stages of this project and have the ultimate say about how data are shared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research documents the concerning rates and negative outcomes of adverse childhood&#xD;
      experiences (ACEs). ACEs include child abuse as well as indicators of household (e.g.,&#xD;
      exposure to intimate partner violence [IPV]) and neighborhood (e.g., community violence)&#xD;
      dysfunction. To date, little is known about two-generation programs that may simultaneously&#xD;
      prevent ACEs among children, including IPV in their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed project is to test the impact of a widely researched alcohol and&#xD;
      drug abuse prevention program, the Strengthening Families Program (SFP), on reducing IPV&#xD;
      among caregivers, child abuse, and other ACEs among their children (ages 10 to 14). The SFP&#xD;
      is for both caregivers and children and consists of parenting skills, children's life skills,&#xD;
      and family skills courses taught together in seven 2-hour group sessions preceded by a meal&#xD;
      that includes informal family practice time and group leader coaching. Guided by social&#xD;
      learning and ecological theories that emphasize the importance of the proximal family&#xD;
      environment, the members of this multistakeholder collaborative believe that the SFP has the&#xD;
      strong potential to be effective in reducing IPV in caregivers and additional ACEs in their&#xD;
      children (e.g., child abuse) given the SFP focuses on reducing myriad risk and protective&#xD;
      factors for not only drug use but also for ACEs, including IPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To bolster the program's effectiveness, the investigators will adapt the SFP (the adapted&#xD;
      program will be called Tiwahe Wicaghwicayapi, Lakota for &quot;to strengthen/improve families&quot;) to&#xD;
      be culturally relevant given the large presence of American Indians in Rapid City, SD, where&#xD;
      the project will take place and to have utility for a broader, diverse audience. Notably,&#xD;
      service providers in racially diverse communities frequently do not have the resources to&#xD;
      implement various prevention programs. Thus, there is a need in many communities for ACEs&#xD;
      prevention programming that is culturally grounded and generalizable to the broader&#xD;
      community. The investigators will further enhance the Tiwahe Wicaghwicayapi program to&#xD;
      include additional evidence-based IPV prevention strategies (e.g., economic empowerment) for&#xD;
      adults and peer-to-peer violence prevention strategies (e.g., bystander intervention) for&#xD;
      youth. Specific Aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation and Planning Aims (Year 1): Convene a Research and Practice Advisory Board that&#xD;
      includes elders, practitioners, educators, youth, caregivers, and preventionists (Aim 1a),&#xD;
      and conduct focus groups with diverse youth ages 10 to 14 (N = 10), caregivers (N = 10) and&#xD;
      professionals (N = 10) in order to culturally tailor the SFP in addition to integrating the&#xD;
      IPV prevention components (Aim 1b). Conduct an open pilot trial of the adapted program with&#xD;
      10 families (Aim 1c). Engage youth (N = 10) and caregivers (N = 10) in cognitive testing of&#xD;
      survey instruments to be used in the subsequent clinical trial (Aim 1d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome and Process Evaluation Aims (Years 2 and 3): Following widespread community&#xD;
      recruitment, implement and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Tiwahe&#xD;
      Wicaghwicayapi program with high-risk families (i.e., American Indian, low income) (Aim 2a).&#xD;
      Conduct program observations and fidelity checks (Aim 2b). Gather efficacy data of the Tiwahe&#xD;
      Wicaghwicayapi program using a randomized control trial in which eligible families will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the treatment condition (N = 75 families enrolled) or a wait-list&#xD;
      control condition (N = 75 families enrolled), using pre-, immediate post- and 8-month post-&#xD;
      follow-up surveys to test for reductions in ACEs (e.g., child abuse) in youth ages 10 to 14&#xD;
      (N = 150 enrolled) and reductions in IPV in caregivers (N = 150 enrolled) for individuals in&#xD;
      the treatment group compared to the wait-list control group (Aim 2c). Exploratory analyses&#xD;
      will identify mediators (e.g., increases in adult supervision, economic empowerment) and&#xD;
      moderators (e.g., gender) of program outcomes (Aim 2d). Conduct exit interview with youth (N&#xD;
      = 10), caregivers (N = 10), and program facilitators (N = 10) to gather perceptions of&#xD;
      program implementation and impact (Aim 2e). Engage a subset of families (N = 10 youth and N =&#xD;
      10 adults) post-intervention in Photovoice in order to document via photography and group&#xD;
      discussions what family strengths look like with a specific focus on what they learned in&#xD;
      Tiwahe Wicaghwicayapi program (Aim 2f).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revision and Dissemination Aims (Year 3): Using data collected as part of Aims 2a to 2f,&#xD;
      revise the program and training manuals in anticipation of widespread dissemination to other&#xD;
      communities with a large presence of American Indians (Aim 3a). Disseminate the findings and&#xD;
      lessons learned to diverse audiences (Aim 3b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is highly significant given the high rates and deleterious outcomes of ACEs in&#xD;
      youth including IPV in caregivers. The project is innovative in that the investigators will&#xD;
      adapt, implement, and evaluate a highly promising, evidence-based program among a diverse&#xD;
      group of high-risk families and use innovative evaluation methodologies (e.g., Photovoice).&#xD;
      Finally, the project is feasible given its seasoned team of researchers and project partners,&#xD;
      who have a highly successful history of previous collaborations and close attention paid to&#xD;
      methodological and programmatic considerations.&#xD;

    <description>The Tiwahe Wicagwicayapi seven-session program is for children ages 10 to 14 who are Native American and/or living in poverty and their caregivers. The program begins with a traditional Lakota meal followed by family time and break-out time for caregivers only and children only. The program includes skill-building activities as well as the integration of Lakota language, history, and culture. The program is facilitated by diverse individuals, predominantly Native Americans in Rapid City and surrounding tribal communities.</description>
