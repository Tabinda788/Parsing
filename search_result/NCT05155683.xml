  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light and ultrasound can be interesting alternatives to reduce abdominal fat. Thus, the main&#xD;
      objective of this study will be to evaluate the effects of these isolated techniques and&#xD;
      their association in subcutaneous abdominal localized fat. These techniques will be used&#xD;
      adding muscle electrostimulation in all groups. A total of 40 female participants will be&#xD;
      recruited at the university outpatient, which will be distributed among four experimental&#xD;
      groups: light + sham ultrasound + electrostimulation; light sham + ultrasound +&#xD;
      electrostimulation; combined treatment (light + ultrasound) + electrostimulation; sham&#xD;
      combined treatment + electrostimulation. The treatments will consist of eight sessions, twice&#xD;
      a week for a month, being 90 minutes per session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The search for the ideal shape and the lifestyle that favours the increase of adipose depots&#xD;
      are some factors responsible for the increasing demand for procedures to reduce localized&#xD;
      fat. It has been shown that photobiomodulation (PBM) and low-frequency ultrasound (LOFU) can&#xD;
      be interesting alternatives to treat this aesthetic dysfunction. However, there is no&#xD;
      consensus about the best parameters for the application of these therapeutic resources. Thus,&#xD;
      the main objective of this study will be to evaluate the effects of these isolated techniques&#xD;
      and their association in subcutaneous abdominal localized fat.This will be a controlled,&#xD;
      randomised, double-blind, single-centred clinical trial. Infrared light emitting diode - LED&#xD;
      - (830±20 nm, 71 milliwatt per square centimeter mW/cm², 127.8 J/cm²), low-frequency&#xD;
      ultrasound (30 kilohertz (kHz), 3 W/cm²) and combination of techniques will be used, adding&#xD;
      muscle electrostimulation in all groups (2500 Hz, 30 bps, 50%). A total of 40 female&#xD;
      participants will be recruited at the university outpatient, which will be distributed among&#xD;
      four experimental groups that will compose the pilot study: PBM + sham ultrasound +&#xD;
      electromyostimulation; PBM sham + LOFU + electromyostimulation; combined treatment (PBM +&#xD;
      LOFU) + electromyostimulation; sham combined treatment + electromyostimulation. At each&#xD;
      session, the participants will receive 30 minutes PBM with an abdominal strap, subsequent&#xD;
      demarcation on the target area to be treated with LOFU for 30 minutes and completion with 20&#xD;
      minutes of electrically induced muscle contraction. The treatments will consist of eight&#xD;
      sessions, twice a week for a month. The main outcome of this study will be abdominal skinfold&#xD;
      reduction and the secondary variables will be including anthropometric data, local&#xD;
      temperature, nutritional routine and physical activity data, quality of life, self-esteem,&#xD;
      satisfaction grade with the treatment and visual changes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The abdomen of the participants will be cleaned by using a neutral cleansing soap. Each participant will receive safety glasses for eye protection, which will also contribute to blindness of the study. PBM will be applied when using abdominal straps as developed by Cosmedical (Mauá, São Paulo, Brazil). The abdomen strap will be covered with a sheet and that will also help with the blindness of the study. After randomization, the study population will be divided into four groups (n= 10 per group), which are: (1) Group A - PBM with infrared LED application + sham ultrasound + muscle electrostimulation; (2) Group B - LED sham PBM + ultrasound + muscle electrostimulation; (3) Group C - combined treatment (PBM + ultrasound) + muscle electrostimulation; (4) Group D - sham combined treatment + muscle electrostimulation.</intervention_model_description>

Quantification of the level of concern in relation to self-image is done through a sum of responses. Result less than or equal to 110 points indicates there is no concern; greater than 110 and less than or equal to 138 points indicates a slight concern; greater than 138 and less than or equal to 167 points indicates moderate concern and if greater than 168 points indicates serious concern.</description>

Participants will be instructed to wear bathing or gym clothes and they will be positioned with their backs to a black background wall, at a distance of 0.7 m from it, on a paper template fixed to the ground, as suggested by Dias et al., (2017). Then, a professional trained for this purpose will be positioned at a distance of 1 m from the participant and will capture four records of her, these being in the anterior, posterior and lateral positions (90° to the right and to the left). Focal length, room lighting and recording mode will also be standardized.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 30.</time_frame>
    <description>The participants satisfaction grade with the treatment will be verified by means of a questionnaire containing seven multiple choice questions prepared by our research group based on data contained in the literature. The degree of discomfort during the treatment will be evaluated; if discomfort occurred, for how long did it persist; the degree of satisfaction in relation to the results achieved; the percentage degree of improvement of the complaint; whether the observed effects were below, within or above what was expected; whether she would do the treatment again; and how much would it indicate the treatment for someone close to it with the same complaint.</description>
