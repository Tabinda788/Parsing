  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bed rest after embryo transfer (ET) has been clinically advised without robust scientific&#xD;
      evidence. In our unit, post ET instructions are given immediately after ET to sub-fertile&#xD;
      women while lying in bed. The aim of the study is to compare the reproductive outcome of this&#xD;
      practice compared with immediate ambulation and giving instructions after emptying the&#xD;
      bladder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bed rest after embryo transfers has been clinically advised without robust scientific&#xD;
      evidence. Most of the assisted reproductive units routinely recommend a variable period of&#xD;
      bedrest immediately after embryo transfer (ET) procedure without clear scientific evidence of&#xD;
      its benefit. Three Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that included 712 embryo transfers with&#xD;
      variable duration of bedrest did not report a benefit in pregnancy outcome. Only one study,&#xD;
      however compared bedrest with no bedrest. In contrast, a 2013 RCT reported a harmful effect&#xD;
      on the pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, data on patients using embryos derived from their own oocytes are limited. In&#xD;
      addition, there was no subgroup analysis to exclude confounding factors like number of&#xD;
      oocytes retrieved and quality of embryos transferred. Few of these studies included embryos&#xD;
      transferred after preimplantation genetic diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale behind bedrest come from the belief that decreased physical activity will help&#xD;
      in embryo retention within the uterine cavity after replacement6. Ultrasound examination&#xD;
      before and after ET with immediate ambulation did not show any uterine displacement of the&#xD;
      air bubble. if gravity displaces transferred embryos, then staying with full bladder in&#xD;
      supine position will make the anteverted ante flexed uterus more horizontal and increase the&#xD;
      gravity effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, although bed rest is one of the most practiced treatments to improve reproductive&#xD;
      outcome, most clinicians consider it the least crucial factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our unit, post ET instructions, which, may take up to 5 minutes, are practiced immediately&#xD;
      after ET to patients while lying in bed. The aim of the study is to compare the effect of&#xD;
      this practice with immediate ambulation and giving instructions after emptying the bladder in&#xD;
      a sitting position on the reproductive outcome in patients undergoing assisted reproductive&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
