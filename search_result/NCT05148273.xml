  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is expected that 84% natural pregnancy will occur at the end of the first 12 months of&#xD;
      sexual intercourse without the use of contraceptive methods.The lack of natural fertility is&#xD;
      under the influence of multiple factors. These factors can be summarized as age, past&#xD;
      infections, genetic factors, anatomical structural disorders, environmental toxins,&#xD;
      occupational exposure, lifestyle and sexually transmitted infections.Severe psychological&#xD;
      stress, anxiety and depression are encountered in the diagnosis, treatment method and&#xD;
      management of the related process in couples who are faced with the diagnosis of infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the telehealth service that came to the fore in the world in the 1950s, nurses use it in&#xD;
      the management of many treatment processes such as infertility treatment, with the roles of&#xD;
      managing the information collection process, making decisions with the information they&#xD;
      receive, and transmitting information on patients who are far away and need constant&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assisted reproductive technologies, which are the current treatment method of infertility,&#xD;
      have been used effectively for thirty years. Anxiety control is important in the success of&#xD;
      treatment in the treatment process, which is both costly and stressful. Providing 24/7 hours&#xD;
      of counseling by using telehealth methods contributes to the reduction of this anxiety.&#xD;

      Ethics committee and hospital approval were obtained in order to conduct the study. The&#xD;
      sample of the study consists of people who applied to the IVF clinic of Süleyman Demirel&#xD;
      University Research and Practice Hospital. The work is planned to be completed between April&#xD;
      2021 and March 2022. In the first meeting with the participants, it is carried out by taking&#xD;
      precautions to protect against the COVID 19 pandemic, in cases where it is met face to face.&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into groups with 1 to 1 method in randomization. Participants&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention group will be given a personal information form and beck anxiety&#xD;
      scale before treatment, followed by telehealth service throughout the treatment protocol, and&#xD;
      the beck anxiety scale will be repeated at the end of the treatment. In the control group, a&#xD;
      personal information form and Beck anxiety scale will be applied before the treatment and&#xD;
      will be repeated after the procedure.&#xD;

    <description>After the selection process with 1 to 1 randomization method, a personal information form and Beck anxiety scale will be applied to the women selected for the case group on the day of the initiation of treatment with assisted reproductive techniques interview. Then, within an average of 10 days, there is a treatment procedure including planned drug use, messages containing drug doses, drug use, drug administration, follicle count, reminder of the times of operations such as OPU, IUI, ET, and motivational issues. Medication use, time, date, dose, application form and motivational sentences will be sent every day through the WhatsApp application. The Beck anxiety scale will be repeated on the day of IUI and ET procedures, and the effect of telehealth practices on the anxiety levels of women undergoing infertility treatment will be evaluated. During the study, the participants will be able to reach the researcher from their mobile phones whenever they want.</description>
