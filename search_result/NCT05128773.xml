  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, randomized, double blind, multicenter, 2-arm study evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of amcenestrant compared with tamoxifen in patients with hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive early breast cancer who have discontinued adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI)&#xD;
      therapy due to treatment related toxicity. The primary objective is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      superiority of amcenestrant versus tamoxifen on invasive breast cancer-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment duration per participant will be 5 years, followed with a subsequent 5-years&#xD;
      follow-up period. For the treatment period, visits are scheduled at the start of treatment,&#xD;
      then at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment start, and then every 12 weeks for the first 2&#xD;
      years and every 24 weeks for year 3 to 5. For the follow-up period, visits are scheduled 30&#xD;
      days after last treatment and then every 12 months. Three periods are planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of up to 28 days,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A treatment period of up to 5 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up period of up to 5 years.&#xD;

             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any another selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), tamoxifen or&#xD;
             toremifene are not allowed as prior adjuvant therapy but could have been used as&#xD;
             neoadjuvant therapy for a total duration of 3 months. Participants who were treated&#xD;

             disease progression are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is receiving concurrent HER2 directed therapy. Appropriate wash out&#xD;
             between the last dose of HER2 directed therapy and randomization should be at least 4&#xD;
