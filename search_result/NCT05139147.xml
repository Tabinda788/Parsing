          -  Suspicion of aortic dissection, presumed septic embolus or suspicion of bacterial&#xD;
             endocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular&#xD;
             territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure due to stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Difficult endovascular access, difficult aortic arch or severe neurovascular&#xD;
             tortuosity that will result in an inability to deliver endovascular therapy.&#xD;

          -  Presence of a carotid artery stenosis or occlusion requiring balloon angioplasty or&#xD;
             stenting at time of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that&#xD;
             will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.&#xD;
