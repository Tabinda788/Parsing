      Scientific background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone health of the elderly is a major health concern which has gained a lot of attention&#xD;
      lately since elderly populations are growing worldwide(Vijayakumar and Büsselberg, 2016). It&#xD;
      is expected for Egypt in particular to have 130 million inhabitant by 2050, out of which 30%&#xD;
      will be above 50 years of age(Chen et al., 2013; Gheita and Hammam, 2018). Aging is commonly&#xD;
      accompanied by musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis as a result&#xD;
      of disturbances occurring in bone remodeling (Gheno et al., 2012). These disorders greatly&#xD;
      increase the risk of bone fractures, such as hip and vertebral fractures, and thus&#xD;
      compromising the quality of life of these patients(Gheno et al., 2012). The prevalence of&#xD;
      these musculoskeletal disorders is also affected by gender, studies claim that females are&#xD;
      more prone to osteoporosis and osteoarthritis than males(on Osteoporosis and Prevention,&#xD;
      2001; Gheno et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone mineral density measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has been considered as the&#xD;
      gold standard for assessing bone health for a long time(Link and Heilmeier, 2016). However,&#xD;
      the national institute of health on its osteoporosis consensus conference pointed out that&#xD;
      bone strength depends not only on its density but also on quality(on Osteoporosis and&#xD;
      Prevention, 2001). Therefore, complementary diagnostic methods for assessing bone quality are&#xD;
      needed to improve the prediction of individual fracture risk(Link and Heilmeier, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various attempts has been made by researchers since then to develop a satisfactory method to&#xD;
      assess bone quality, trabecular bone score (TBS) is one of the most successful trials. TBS is&#xD;
      a texture parameter related to bone microarchitecture that uses conventional DXA images of&#xD;
      the lumbar spine to extract the gray-level texture features providing skeletal information&#xD;
      that is not captured from the standard BMD measurement. It has been used successfully as an&#xD;
      adjunctive to DXA, and further research attempts are made to investigate its use&#xD;
      independently to predict fracture risk.(Martineau, Silva and Leslie, 2017; Shevroja et al.,&#xD;
      2017) The success of TBS has led the research community to examine the potential use of&#xD;
      texture parameters to assess bone microarchitecture in different imaging modalities(Shevroja&#xD;
      et al., 2017). Texture is one of the main visual pattern recognition techniques used by&#xD;
      humans to identify objects or regions of interest in an image. It is an innate property of&#xD;
      each object, containing important information about the structural arrangement of its surface&#xD;
      and its relation with surroundings (Haralick, Shanmugam and Dinstein, 1973). Textural&#xD;
      analysis is a type of quantitative image assessment based on relationships between pixel&#xD;
      intensities. It is gaining a wide range of attention nowadays in the field of biomedical&#xD;
      imaging since it can be beneficial in tissue characterization with various diagnostic&#xD;
      applications(Gebejes and Huertas, 2013; Summers, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various methods for textural analysis, Grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is&#xD;
      one of the popular and most commonly used for extraction of texture features(Gebejes and&#xD;
      Huertas, 2013). It is a second order statistical method of characterizing the texture of an&#xD;
      image by considering the frequency of occurring of pixel grey value pairs and their spatial&#xD;
      relationship(Haralick, Shanmugam and Dinstein, 1973; Gebejes and Huertas, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is nowadays used routinely for multiple diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures and is known to use significantly lower radiation dose than CT with higher spatial&#xD;
      resolution and at lower cost, therefore could be a suitable candidate as a screening tool for&#xD;
      bone quality(Scarfe, Farman and Sukovic, 2006; Scarfe and Farman, 2008). We hereby&#xD;
      hypothesize that using grey level co-occurrence matrix derived texture features to assess&#xD;
      bone quality can be applicable to CBCT scans, instead of the debatable use of grey levels to&#xD;
      measure bone density which in many studies proved to be inadequate in comparison to the&#xD;
      calibrated Hounsfield units of multi-detector CT(Pauwels et al., 2013; De Rosa et al., 2020;&#xD;
      Gonçalves et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate if GLCM texture features are correlated&#xD;
      with age-gender trabecular bone variations in different regions of interest on mandibular&#xD;
      CBCT scans. This correlation will help in guiding the future selection of textural features&#xD;
      and anatomical regions suitable for developing a potential screening method for age and sex&#xD;
      related skeletal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PECO Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P: Mandibular trabecular bone of adult Egyptians E: Females (18-40 OR above 40) C: Males&#xD;
      (18-40 OR above 40) O: Grey level co-occurrence matrix textural features&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the correlation between the age and sex of Egyptian population and GLCM derived&#xD;
      texture features of mandibular trabecular bone?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone health of elderly is a major public health concern. Although diagnosisof disorders&#xD;
      affecting bone health requires assessing bone quality as well as density, there is still a&#xD;
      shortage in diagnostic techniques that could examine bone quality successfully at&#xD;
      considerably low radiation dose and low cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect the presence of a correlation between age-sex of an individual and the texture&#xD;
      features of mandibular trabecular bone derived from grey level co-occurrence matrix in a&#xD;
      sample of adult Egyptian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null: There is no difference in trabecular textural features between different age groups or&#xD;
      between the two sexes Alternative: There is a difference in trabecular textural features&#xD;
      between different age groups or between the two sexes&#xD;
&#xD;

      Data sources\Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT image acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular CBCT scans will be retrieved retrospectively from the database registry of oral&#xD;
      and maxillofacial radiology department, faculty of dentistry, Cairo University. The included&#xD;
      CBCT images shall be obtained using Planmeca ProMax® 3D Mid CBCT machine, at resolution of&#xD;
      0.4 voxel, 20*10 cm FOV (single mandibular arch), operating at 8 mA and 90 Kvp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CBCT images will be obtained in DICOM format (Digital Imaging Communication in Medicine)&#xD;
      and viewed by Romexis software for analysis by a senior oral radiologist. Images with&#xD;
      artifacts and poor visual quality, such as beam hardening artifacts, partial volume effect,&#xD;
      aliasing artifacts, ring artifacts, low sharpness images resulting from patient movements&#xD;
      during scanning, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible CBCT scans will be divided into 4 groups according to age and sex of the patient&#xD;
      (Males younger than 40, Males older than 40, Females younger than 40, Females older than 40).&#xD;
      Groups will be assigned a letter A, B, C, or D in a random order, so that only the assistant&#xD;
      supervisor will be aware of the demographic data of each group but will be concealed from the&#xD;
      principal investigator who will perform the textural analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corrected sagittal cuts of the three regions of interest (anterior, premolar, molar) will be&#xD;
      prepared from the eligible scans, then images will be saved in a BMP format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Segmentation and texture analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BMP images of the corrected sagittal cuts of the cases will be imported to MaZda software&#xD;
      (Technical University of Lodz, Institute of Electronics, Poland). A round region of interest&#xD;
      will be manually cropped apical to the tooth, so that its size will be big enough to include&#xD;
      the maximum trabecular bone present with no or little non-trabecular tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLCM textural features will be calculated by the software. All parameters will be calculated&#xD;
      for two distances between pixels (d1 = 1, d2 = 2) and four sweeping directions (horizontal,&#xD;
      diagonal, vertical and anti-diagonal) corresponding to (φ = 0°,45°,90°, 135°,&#xD;
      respectively).The mean of the values at different positions will be taken as a single reading&#xD;
      representing the texture feature value for the area of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of quantitative variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleven texture features will be calculated for 3 regions of interest on each eligible CBCT&#xD;
      scan. Texture values will be handled as mean and standard deviation, and comparison between&#xD;
      different age\gender groups will be done for selection of significant features. Correlation&#xD;
      analysis will be done to test the correlation between age and gender and selected texture&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
