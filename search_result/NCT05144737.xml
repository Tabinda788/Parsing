  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study titled &quot;A Virtual Cardiometabolic Health Program for African Immigrants (The&#xD;
      Afro-DPP Program) will be conducted to address the cardiometabolic of community-dwelling&#xD;
      African immigrants who have multiple cardiometabolic risk factors including hypertension,&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes, high cholesterol, and overweight/obesity. The proposed study will recruit a&#xD;
      total of 60 participants and will use a non-equivalent control group design to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention at two African churches in the Baltimore, Washington, D.C.&#xD;
      area. The two churches will be randomly assigned to the intervention or delayed intervention&#xD;
      group. At the end of a 6-month follow-up period, the control church will receive the&#xD;
      intervention (delayed control group). All participants will receive a Bluetooth-enabled&#xD;
      digital scale (Omron Model: BCM-500) that measures body composition including Body Weight,&#xD;
      Body Fat percentage, Visceral Fat, Skeletal Muscle percentage, Resting Metabolism and Body&#xD;
      Mass Index. A Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure monitor (Omron Model: BP7250) will also be&#xD;
      distributed to all participants. All participants will download the Omron Connect app which&#xD;
      will allow the participants to sync participants' blood pressure readings and body&#xD;
      composition readings into the app. The research team will access these readings to monitor&#xD;
      study outcomes and participants progress during the follow-up period.&#xD;
