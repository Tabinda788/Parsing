  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following an initial consultation with a memory, resources and research centre (MRRC) doctor,&#xD;
      a day hospital may be prescribed to carry out an assessment of cognitive disorders. Patients&#xD;
      are then usually followed up in consultation at least once a year, in the framework of a new&#xD;
      day hospital and/or consultations with a MRRC doctor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be included at the time of the day hospital assessment. All patients received&#xD;
      in the day hospital of the MRRC of Tours will be offered the TPI examination. The patients&#xD;
      included will be followed up for a period of 5 years and the TPI examination will be repeated&#xD;
      according to the same modalities, as part of their follow-up at the MRRC and/or in the&#xD;
      context of a new day hospital if necessary.&#xD;

    <description>Ultrasound examination with Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI) TPI is a relatively simple, rapid and non-invasive ultrasound examination which consists of applying a standard ultrasound probe to the acoustic window of the temporal bone to first measure the velocity of the middle cerebral artery in Doppler mode and secondly the cerebral pulsatility (CP) of a region of approximately 10cm2 centred on the middle cerebral artery in B-Echo mode. After collecting the information, the TPI examination will be performed by MRRC staff specially trained in TPI by engineers. The duration of the examination is between 20 and 30 minutes, including hardware installation. Four 30-second PC acquisitions will be collected per examination, with the patient lying supine on the bed in the day hospital room, then one measurement every minute for 3 minutes after standing.</description>
