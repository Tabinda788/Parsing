        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed informed consent (obtained according to institutional guidelines)&#xD;
             prior to initiation of any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 years at the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Locally advanced or metastatic malignancy with one or more relevant biomarkers related&#xD;
             to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumor type&#xD;
             and stage of disease, or in the opinion of the Investigator, would be unlikely to&#xD;
             tolerate or derive clinically meaningful benefit from appropriate standard of care&#xD;
             therapy, or no standard therapy exists for their tumor type/stage. Prior treatment&#xD;
             with immune checkpoint inhibitors is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST Guideline&#xD;
             Version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Performance Status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate hematologic and organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willingness and ability to release archival tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Females of childbearing potential and male subjects must agree to use an effective&#xD;
             method of contraception prior to the first dose and for 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             ZN-c3.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 1. Any of the following treatment interventions within the specified time frame prior&#xD;
             to C1D1:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Major surgery within 28 days (any surgical incision should be fully healed prior&#xD;
                  to study drug administration);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any chemotherapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter);&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Radiation therapy within 21 days; however, if the radiation portal covered ≤5% of&#xD;
                  the bone marrow, the subject is eligible irrespective of the end date of&#xD;
                  radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Current use of any other investigational drug therapy &lt;28 days or 5 half-lives&#xD;
                  (whichever is shorter).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Inability to discontinue treatment prescription or non-prescription drugs, or to&#xD;
                  discontinue consumption of food and herbal supplements, that are strong/moderate&#xD;
                  CYP3A4 inhibitors, P-gp inhibitors, or strong CYP3A4 inducers at least 14 days&#xD;
                  prior to start of study drug treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior therapy with ZN-c3 or any other WEE1 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A serious illness or medical condition(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Unresolved toxicity of Grade &gt;1 attributed to any prior therapies (excluding Grade ≤2&#xD;
             neuropathy, alopecia or skin pigmentation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant or lactating females (including the cessation of lactation) or females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential who have a positive serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior&#xD;
             to C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with active (uncontrolled, metastatic) second malignancies or requiring&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Individuals who are judged by the Investigator to be unsuitable as study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. 12-lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) of&#xD;
             &gt;480 ms, except for subjects with atrioventricular pacemakers or other conditions&#xD;
             (e.g., right bundle branch block) that render the QT measurement invalid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History or current evidence of congenital or family history of long QT syndrome or&#xD;
             Torsade de Pointes (TdP).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Taking medications with a known risk of TdP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Concomitant medication that leads to significant QT prolongation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers and P-gp inhibitors&#xD;
