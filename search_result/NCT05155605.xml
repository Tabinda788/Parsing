  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center interventional study of the GRAIL multi-cancer early&#xD;
      detection test with return of test results for participants enrolled through healthcare&#xD;
      systems in North America. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance&#xD;
      of the GRAIL multi-cancer early detection test in a population of individuals who are&#xD;
      eligible for guideline-recommended cancer screening. In cases with a &quot;cancer signal detected&quot;&#xD;
      test result, participants will undergo diagnostic procedures based on the test returned&#xD;
      cancer signal origin(s) to determine if they have cancer. The number and types of diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures required to achieve diagnostic resolution will be assessed. Participant-reported&#xD;
      outcomes will be collected at several time points to assess participants' perceptions about&#xD;
      the multi-cancer early detection test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 10,000 participants as defined by eligibility criteria&#xD;
      over an anticipated enrollment period of approximately 10 months at up to 30 clinical&#xD;
      institutions within North America. Participants will be actively followed for approximately 3&#xD;
      years from the date of their enrollment.&#xD;

The target age categories of 60-69 years and 70-79 years will be enriched to increase the number of cancer events that are observed during the study.</description>
