      For the treatment of relapsed and refractory MM, the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and&#xD;
      Treatment of Multiple Myeloma pointed out that relapsed MM is highly heterogeneous, and&#xD;
      individualized evaluation of relapsed patients is required to determine the treatment time.&#xD;
      Patients with biochemical recurrence with only elevated M protein do not need immediate&#xD;
      treatment, only regular follow-up visits. For patients with CRAB manifestations or rapid&#xD;
      biochemical relapse, treatment needs to be initiated immediately. Patients who relapse within&#xD;
      6 months can switch to a drug combination with other mechanisms of action; patients who&#xD;
      relapse within 6 to 12 months should first switch to a drug combination with other mechanisms&#xD;
      of action, or they can be retreated with the original drug; 12 months Patients with the above&#xD;
      recurrence can use the original regimen to re-induction therapy, or switch to a drug regimen&#xD;
      with other mechanisms of action. Bortezomib, lenalidomide, and thalidomide are currently the&#xD;
      key drugs for the treatment of relapsed MM in China. Patients with suitable conditions should&#xD;
      undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, while allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation is rarely used because of higher transplant-related mortality.&#xD;

&#xD;
      BCMA (B cell maturation antigen), also called TNFRSF17 (TNF receptor superfamily member 17,&#xD;
      TNF ligand superfamily member 17), is mainly expressed in plasma cells and mature B&#xD;
      lymphocytes, is basically undetectable in other normal human cells . BCMA is the most&#xD;
      selectively expressed receptor on the MM cell line, and its expression gradually increases&#xD;
      with the differentiation of B cells, and it also gradually increases in the disease process&#xD;
      of multiple myeloma. Experiments in mice found that overexpression of BCMA can induce protein&#xD;
      kinase B, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kB (nuclear factors kB,&#xD;
      NF-kB) signal cascade to enhance the growth and survival of MM cells, thereby Speed up the&#xD;
      progress of MM; and down-regulation of BCMA expression can significantly reduce the formation&#xD;
      of MM colonies and reduce the survival rate of MM cells. BCMA has become an ideal antigen&#xD;
      target for MM because of its high selective expression in MM cell lines and its important&#xD;
      role in normal and malignant late B cell proliferation, differentiation and antibody&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
