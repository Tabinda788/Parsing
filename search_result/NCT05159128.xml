  <eligibility>
    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and&#xD;
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are abnormalities,&#xD;
             they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population. This&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel including liver enzymes, other specific tests,&#xD;
             blood coagulation, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges,&#xD;
             the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or&#xD;
             deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and&#xD;
             reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be recorded in the&#xD;
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight not less than 50 kilograms (kg) and body mass index within the range 18 to&#xD;
             30 kg per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) or freeze for future use for the&#xD;
             purposes of assisted reproduction during the study and for at least 90 days after&#xD;
             receiving the administration of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating they understand the purpose of,&#xD;
             and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is recommended that participants are up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations&#xD;
             prior to screening as per routine local medical guidelines. For study participants who&#xD;
             received locally-approved (and including emergency use-authorized) Coronavirus Disease&#xD;
             of 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines recently prior to study entry, follow applicable local&#xD;
             vaccine labeling, guidelines, and standards of care for participants receiving&#xD;
             immune-targeted therapy when determining an appropriate interval between vaccination&#xD;
             and study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had major surgery, (example, requiring general anesthesia) within 3 months before&#xD;
             screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned&#xD;
             during the time the participant is expected to participate in the study or within 12&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of study intervention administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of surgical resection of the stomach, small or large intestine (excluding&#xD;
             appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or resection of benign polyps)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding associated with procedures such as endoscopy or phlebotomy; or use&#xD;
             of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to screening or planned use during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preplanned surgery or procedures that would interfere with the conduct of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant infection within 30 days prior to screening or any serious&#xD;
             infection within 6 months prior to screening requiring intravenous antimicrobial&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
