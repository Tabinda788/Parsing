  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised placebo controlled, double-blind, 30 Volunteer trial of Elio™ administered 2.4&#xD;
      grams per day in assessing its effects on post-exercise strength recovery and increases in&#xD;
      markers associated with muscle injury and exertion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periods of intense physical activity and exertion can lead to disruption of normal muscle&#xD;
      homeostasis and the resultant muscle injury and recovery can impact upon quality of life&#xD;
      especially in adult populations. Recovery post-exercise is therefore important to all active&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a link between high-intensity exercise and reduced power and performance in the&#xD;
      following exercise sessions. The effect on performance is measures as a reduced muscle force&#xD;
      production or loss in strength and can correlate with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).&#xD;
      The reduced power/performance seen 24 hours - 7days post-exercise is affected by recovery&#xD;
      methods applied, individual fitness levels and intensity of exercise injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several theories have been proposed to explain the mechanisms underlying DOMS. These include&#xD;
      inflammation and muscle damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise-induced muscle damage is a transient phenomenon caused by unfamiliar, damaging&#xD;
      exercise and is characterized by structural damage to myofibers and secondary inflammation.&#xD;
      Signs and symptoms often persist for several days after exercise and typically include muscle&#xD;
      soreness, elevated blood levels of intramuscular enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK),&#xD;
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and myoglobin (MB) that often result in elevations in circulating&#xD;
      markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and various interleukins. To date,&#xD;
      extensive research has been published that explore the many recovery strategies purported to&#xD;
      minimize indirect markers of muscle damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, from a nutritional standpoint the results are weak. It is therefore important to&#xD;
      develop nutritional products that can lessen the impact of these injuries' individuals&#xD;
      succumb to or expedite their recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional recovery strategies purported to minimise indirect markers of muscle damage and&#xD;
      improve the inflammatory response can positively influence the recovery process after&#xD;
      damaging exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These strategies could in turn be used to prime the muscle for physical challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is a clear absence of natural approaches with proven evidence to address&#xD;
      DOMS and the resulting performance declines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be taken in the short&#xD;
      term to reduce DOMS associated pain and inflammation. However, these drugs do not address&#xD;
      performance strength loss linked to DOMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute injuries to discrete muscle groups can be indirectly detected by an array of systemic&#xD;
      biomarkers, which become elevated at various time-points following the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This array of biomarkers represents key biochemical processes in muscle homeostasis, cellular&#xD;
      integrity, mitochondrial function and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary investigations in vitro and in vivo suggest that the administration of peptides&#xD;
      isolated from the protein extract of fava beans, which constitute Elio™, can augment muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis (i.e. phospo-S6) and attenuate proteolytic signaling (i.e. Fbxo32 and&#xD;
      Trim63) and surrogate inflammatory markers (TNFα and IL6). Thus, supporting the use of this&#xD;
      hydrolysate in maintaining muscle homeostasis and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the present study the investigators will investigate whether daily dietary&#xD;
      supplementation of Elio™, over the course of 15 days can prime the muscle by improving&#xD;
      strength recovery and attenuating the expression of systemic markers associated with muscle&#xD;
      injury and over exertion following resistance type exercise in a healthy male population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of Elio™ supplementation, a protein hydrolysate derived from fava&#xD;
      bean protein extract, on strength recovery and markers of muscle health, injury and function&#xD;
      following strenuous resistance type exercise in male volunteers, aged between 30 and 45 years&#xD;
      old following 17 days of supplementation.&#xD;
