  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this proposal is to study whether proning, a technique that has previously been&#xD;
      shown to improve lung function in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),&#xD;
      can prevent those with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 from progressing to severe&#xD;
      disease when initiated early, thereby averting intubation, reducing hospitalization, and,&#xD;
      ultimately, decreasing mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2. At this time,&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is believed to infect alveolar cells, directly impairing lung function and&#xD;
      eliciting a profound inflammatory response that further damages the lungs. Between 1 in 20&#xD;
      and 1 in 10 patients infected with this virus die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crucial decision point in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department is the decision to admit to the hospital for further treatment, or discharge the&#xD;
      moderately symptomatic (hypoxic and feel ill) but not critically ill patients. However,&#xD;
      patients who present with initially mild to moderate symptoms may progress to severe disease.&#xD;
      There is, therefore, an unmet need to identify interventions that prevent progression to&#xD;
      critical illness in moderately symptomatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anecdotal reports from Emergency Physicians suggest that alternating prone and supine&#xD;
      positioning (i.e. instructing the patient to periodically turn over) improves hypoxia and&#xD;
      delays intubation. Dubbed proning, this technique improves hypoxia in 6-7 out of 10 intubated&#xD;
      patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Alternating supine and prone&#xD;
      positioning improves the recruitment of alveoli, improves ventilation-perfusion matching,&#xD;
      increases end-expiratory lung volumes, and improves pulmonary lymphatic drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is innovative because it studies the extension of an intervention previously&#xD;
      restricted to patients in the intensive care units with severe acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS). Current literature on proning in awake patients with ARDS is limited to&#xD;
      retrospective studies with no randomized controlled trials. Further, no clinical trials to&#xD;
      date have explored the benefits of early awake proning in COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of a treatment that prevents disease progression and hospitalization in&#xD;
      patients moderately ill with COVID-19 would decrease morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 as&#xD;
      well as decrease the utilization of scarce healthcare resources. In addition, this trial&#xD;
      would be the first randomized controlled-trial, contributing significantly to the nascent&#xD;
      evidence base on treatment for COVID-19.&#xD;
