  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      118 adults with benign thyroid nodules who were seen at a UW Health clinic for a fine needle&#xD;
      biopsy and do not need surgery will be enrolled and can expect to be on study for a one-time&#xD;
      visit of up to 60 minutes. Each participant will be randomized to watch one of two videos&#xD;
      simulating a patient-surgeon discussion about treatment options for low-risk thyroid cancer&#xD;
      with or without emotionally supportive statements.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will test the extent to which emotionally supportive&#xD;
      communication from a surgeon is associated with patient preference for total thyroidectomy.&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a hypothetical choice experiment with &quot;analogue&quot; patients,&#xD;
      defined as those with a benign thyroid nodule not requiring surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures will be collected, then participants will be randomized to watch a video&#xD;
      simulation of a patient-surgeon discussion about treatment options for low-risk thyroid&#xD;
      cancer with or without emotionally supportive statements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that increased emotionally supportive communication by the&#xD;
      surgeon will decrease the likelihood of patients choosing total thyroidectomy, reduce anxiety&#xD;
      and thyroid cancer fear, and increase decisional confidence, perceived physician empathy,&#xD;
      trust in physician, and information recall.&#xD;

    <time_frame>post video intervention (up to 60 minutes during the only study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure which treatment participants would choose if they were the patient with thyroid cancer in the video (total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy) immediately after they finish watching the video.</description>

    <measure>Participant Decisional Confidence Score</measure>
    <time_frame>post video intervention (up to 60 minutes during the only study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional Confidence in treatment option is measured using a single-item 10-point Likert scale where 1 is 'not confident at all' and 10 is 'completely confident'</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State Trait Anxiety Inventory brief (STAI brief) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline and after video intervention (during 1 day study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI brief is a 6-item survey about how the participant is feeling in the moment (calm, tense, upset, relaxed, content, worried) scored on a 4 point likert scale. The total possible range of scores is 6 to 24 with higher scores indicating higher anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adapted Thyroid Cancer Fear Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline and after video intervention (during 1 day study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The adapted Thyroid Cancer Fear Scale is a 8-item survey originally designed to assess fear of breast cancer in patients undergoing cancer screening. Items are rated on a 5-point scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5) with a total possible range of scores from 8-40 where higher scores indicate increased fear of cancer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adapted Jefferson Scale of Patient's Perceptions of Physician's Empathy Score</measure>
    <time_frame>post video intervention (up to 60 minutes during the only study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>This 5-question instrument assesses patient perceptions of physician empathy, scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' (1) to 'strongly agree' (7). Items are summed, with a max score of 35, higher values indicate a perception of more empathy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adapted Trust in Physician Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>post video intervention (up to 60 minutes during the only study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>This 5-question instrument assesses patient trust in a physician, scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' (1) to 'strongly agree' (5). Responses are summed and scores are on a scale of 5 to 25, with higher values indicating more trust.</description>

    <description>The video is approximately 6 1/2 minutes in length and portrays an emotionally supportive conversation between a patient and surgeon during which the surgeon discusses: the diagnosis, prognosis, available treatment options, benefits and harms of the options, and need for decision making. The surgeon speaks for the majority of the simulated visit and discusses total and hemi-thyroidectomy with the addition of emotionally supportive statements and gestures.</description>
