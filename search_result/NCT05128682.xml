  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is tp evaluate the changes in stress induced Urethral Leak Point&#xD;
      Pressures (LPP) and other urodynamic measurements in response to acute pudendal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (PNS) in patients with a pre-existing implanted urological neurostimulator&#xD;
      stimulating the pudendal nerve.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a neurostimulator implanted at the pudendal nerve will be enrolled and undergo&#xD;
      urodynamic testing. Before testing, study staff will adjust the stimulation settings with a&#xD;
      goal to increase urethral pressure from baseline by at lest 20cm H2O, without causing the&#xD;
      patient discomfort/distress. These settings will be used throughout urodynamics. Before&#xD;
      filling the bladder, a urethral pressure profile study will be completed 3 times with&#xD;
      stimulation off, then 3 times with stimulation on. Leak point pressure (LPP) testing will&#xD;
      then be completed. The patient's bladder will be filled following standard urodynamic testing&#xD;
      protocol. Filling will be paused every 50-100mL to complete LPP assessment. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a light cough, medium cough, forceful cough, and Valsalva maneuver (in that&#xD;
      order). Detrusor pressure will be measured at each event, and staff will document whether or&#xD;
      not a leak was elicited. This will be completed with stimulation off, then with stimulation&#xD;
      on, as the bladder is filled. Once the subject reports a strong urge to void, urethral&#xD;
      pressure profile assessment will be completed again: 3 times with stimulation off, then 3&#xD;
      times with stimulation on. Once urodynamic testing is complete and the patient's bladder is&#xD;
      emptied, a measurement of urethral pressure will be completed with stimulation off, then&#xD;
      during 5 seconds of stimulation, then again with stimulation off.&#xD;

    <description>The neuromodulation settings of the implanted device will be adjusted to deliver acute simulation. Urodynamic testing (UDT) will be completed by filling the bladder and observing for urinary leakage. The assessment will be completed with the stimulation sets turned off and then turned on. At the end of the UDT the settings will be returned to the previously set therapeutic values. The neuromodulation settings constitute the &quot;dose&quot; and can include the voltage/current amplitude, frequency, pulse width, on time/off time duration and electrode polarity assignments. These parameters are limited by the available ranges of the approved neurostimulation device and will be adjusted during the study by the principal investigator to stay within the safe and comfortable levels for each individual study subject.</description>

    <intervention_name>Urodynamic testing with and without pudendal nerve stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>A urodynamic test (UDT) for eligible subjects with and without acute PNS will be conducted. Prior to introducing the acute PNS, the subject's original stimulation properties will be turned off. The implanted neurostimulator device will be programmed to deliver acute PNS per individual tolerance level with the objective of increasing external urethral sphincter pressure. The LPP during Valsalva maneuver or forceful coughing will be assessed with and without acute PNS. The LPP will be assessed at increasing bladder volumes until major detrusor instability, significant leakage (more than drops, stream) or subject discomfort (strong desire to void) is observed. Finally, a UPP with PNS set in an on/off cycling regimen will be conducted to observe the effect on pressures along the length of the urethra.</description>
