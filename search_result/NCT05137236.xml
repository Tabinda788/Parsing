      the study vaccines.&#xD;

      This study will assess whether a single dose of mRNA-1283 at three different dose levels or&#xD;
      mRNA-1283.211 at two different dose levels will boost antibody responses to the Wuhan-Hu-1&#xD;
      (ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2) virus, and to the B.1.351 variant, and potentially other&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 variants, and it will also be used to select a dose for subsequent clinical&#xD;
      evaluation. The study will include an active comparator group of participants who will&#xD;
      receive mRNA-1273.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who received the primary series of mRNA-1273 with appropriate documentation at&#xD;
      least 6 months prior will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive a single boost of mRNA-1283 at&#xD;
      one of three dose levels, a single boost of mRNA-1283.211 at one of two dose levels, or a&#xD;
      single dose of the active comparator, mRNA-1273.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has received systemic immunosuppressants or immune-modifying drugs for &gt;14 days in&#xD;
             total within 6 months prior to screening (for corticosteroids ≥10 milligrams [mg]/day&#xD;

             at any time during participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received or plans to receive any licensed vaccine ≤28 days prior to the injection&#xD;
             (Day 1) or plans to receive a licensed vaccine within 28 days before or after the&#xD;
             study injection, with the exception of influenza vaccines, which may be given 14 days&#xD;
             before or after receipt of a study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received systemic immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit, or plans to receive these during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has donated ≥ 450 milliliters (mL) of blood products within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit or plans to donate blood products during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plans to participate in an interventional clinical trial of an investigational vaccine&#xD;
             or drug while participating in this study.&#xD;
