  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) trials, a diet rich in fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables, nuts and dairy products, and limited in fat content, was shown to be useful in&#xD;
      controlling hypertension, particularly in African Americans (AA). Key components of such a&#xD;
      diet are potassium, magnesium, and alkali, each of which has been implicated in lowering&#xD;
      blood pressure. In the original IND 116,208, the investigators explored whether&#xD;
      potassium-magnesium citrate (KMgCit) as a powder pharmaceutical formulation (dissolved in&#xD;
      water before ingestion) could serve as a surrogate for the DASH diet and would lower blood&#xD;
      pressure among patients with pre- or Stage I hypertension. Unfortunately, previous studies&#xD;
      did not include adequate number of African American patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized crossover trial comprising two phases: Placebo Phase&#xD;
      (microcrystalline cellulose in water) and KMgCit Phase (KMgCit powder in water) to&#xD;
      investigate the use of KMgCit in lowering blood pressure and reducing arterial stiffness. One&#xD;
      half of the subjects will undergo the Placebo phase first followed by the KMgCit phase. The&#xD;
      other half will undergo the KMgCit phase first followed by the Placebo phase. Each phase is 4&#xD;
      weeks in duration with at least 1 week washout between phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-five African American patients of either sex with pre- or Stage I hypertension, with&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure of 120-139 mm or diastolic of &lt; 90 mmHg according the 2017 ACC/AHA&#xD;
      high BP guideline, will be recruited into the trial, with the expectation that 36 patients&#xD;
      would complete both phases of the trial (assuming 20% dropout). They may be AA adult men or&#xD;
      women (&gt; 21 years of age). They may be on ACE inhibitor or ARB, but not on spironolactone or&#xD;
      diuretic. Excluded will be patients with diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, heart disease,&#xD;
      chronic NSAID use, gastrointestinal reflux disease requiring treatment with acid reducing&#xD;
      agent of antacid more than once a week, esophageal-gastric ulcer, chronic diarrhea,&#xD;
      hyperkalemia, abnormal liver function test, subjects who require potassium supplementation on&#xD;
      a regular basis for any reason, pregnancy, history of major depression, bipolar disorder or&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and history of substance abuse&#xD;
