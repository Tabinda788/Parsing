  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a Phase 1 open-label study with a primary purpose of evaluating the food&#xD;
      effect of a high calorie meal as compared to fasting conditions on the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of oral MDMA capsules in healthy volunteers. In addition, increases in heart&#xD;
      rate are anticipated following MDMA administration. Therefore, the secondary purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effect of food on the safety and tolerability of oral MDMA, as well&#xD;
      as MDMA effects on electrocardiogram (ECG). Directly comparing the pharmacokinetics of MDMA&#xD;
      and its active metabolite MDA, in a within-subject crossover study will allow for assessment&#xD;
      of any impacts of food and inform product labeling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor has completed a Phase 3 study of MDMA-assisted therapy for individuals diagnosed&#xD;
      with severe PTSD demonstrating the safety and efficacy of this treatment. However, the effect&#xD;
      of food intake on the absorption and bioavailability of orally administered MDMA is not yet&#xD;
      well characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I, open-label, randomized sequence, multi-dose, 2-period crossover pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) study assesses the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of MDMA. In addition,&#xD;
      an increase in heart rate is anticipated following MDMA administration. Therefore, the&#xD;
      secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of oral MDMA, as well as MDMA effects on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified by the clinical site and invited to phone screen&#xD;
      for the study. Following informed consent, potential study participants will undergo&#xD;
      screening examinations to assess eligibility for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive one of two conditions before the other:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasted Treatments: 10 hours of fasting followed by MDMA administration with 240 mL&#xD;
           water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fed Treatments: A high-fat (approximately 50 percent of total caloric content of the&#xD;
           meal) and high-calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal will be consumed within&#xD;
           30 minutes of MDMA administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be confined at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for each Dosing Session&#xD;
      from the time of check-in on the night before dosing until discharge 48 hours after dosing.&#xD;
      MDMA will be administered on Day 1 following the treatment sequence to which the participant&#xD;
      has been randomized. Concentration-time profiles of MDMA will be determined in the time&#xD;
      interval 0-72 hours post-dose, according to the expected PK profiles of MDMA and its&#xD;
      metabolites. Participants will remain at the CRU for at least 36 hours after administration&#xD;
      of study drug for collection of serial blood samples for PK analysis and safety monitoring.&#xD;
      An additional outpatient visit will occur 72 hours after dosing to collect a final PK sample&#xD;
      and perform safety assessments.&#xD;
