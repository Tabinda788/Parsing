             prior to enrollment in the trial (positive sample must be collected within 72 hours&#xD;
             prior to enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with worsening or stable mild&#xD;
             COVID-19 (one of the following is required):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Presence of at least two respiratory symptom domains (head, throat, nose, chest,&#xD;
                  cough) with a score of ≥2 as determined by Screening FLU-PRO AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient reported assessment that symptoms are present, the symptoms are not&#xD;
                  consistent with the subject's usual health, the symptoms interfere with daily&#xD;
                  activities, and the symptoms have worsened or remained the same relative to the&#xD;

             symptoms is defined as the earlier of the first time at which the subject experienced&#xD;
             subjective fever or any respiratory symptom (headache/head congestion, throat&#xD;
             symptoms, nasal symptoms, chest symptoms, cough).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent (including assent by legal&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. oxygen saturation ≤ 93% on room air at sea level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons who have not been fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and are at high risk of&#xD;
             progressing to severe COVID-19 illness due to having one of the following underlying&#xD;
             conditions and/or sociodemographic risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               7. Sickle cell disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Neurodevelopmental disorders or other conditions that confer medical complexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment&#xD;
