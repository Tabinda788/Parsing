  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a modular dose confirmation and expansion study. The core study design is to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of AZD4573, administered as monotherapy or combination therapy, to participants&#xD;
      with either r/r PTCL or r/r cHL and to confirm the safety profiles and PK in these&#xD;
      populations. Module 1 of this study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      AZD4573 monotherapy in participants with r/r PTCL or r/r cHL. If AZD4573 monotherapy is found&#xD;
      to have promising anti-tumour efficacy in Module 1, an AZD4573 monotherapy Phase II expansion&#xD;
      may be added via a substantial protocol amendment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Module 1 will consist of two r/r PTCL cohorts and one cHL cohort; and each cohort includes 21&#xD;
      participants. A comprehensive initial review of all safety and PK/PD data will be conducted&#xD;
      in approximately the first 6 participants of each cohort (safety run-in), with separate&#xD;
      Safety Review Committees (SRCs) for each cohort executed independently. The safety assessment&#xD;
      will be undertaken by the SRC. Each cohort will have a separate dose confirmation, assessed&#xD;
      independently by the SRC, to assess safety and PK/PD data compared to the known profiles in&#xD;
      the first time in human study (Study D8230C00001) lymphoma population. These SRC reviews will&#xD;
      confirm whether the recommended phase II dose for lymphoma (IV infusion 12 mg once weekly,&#xD;
      including intra-participant ramp-up) is safe and tolerable or if additional dose optimisation&#xD;
      is indicated at a revised dose and/or schedule. All cohorts can be opened and delivered&#xD;
      independently of each other.&#xD;
