      Select Proliferative Proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR) patients who are planning to&#xD;
      undergo vitrectomy for informed notification. After obtaining informed consent, vitrectomy&#xD;
      will be performed. After hemorrhage is removed, the macular shape can be obtained through&#xD;
      intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) real-time scanning. If the central Macular&#xD;
      Thickness (CMT) of the patient is ≥250μm, random Enter the Anti-vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (anti-VEGF) treatment group, the internal limiting membrane stripping group and the&#xD;
      glucocorticoid treatment group for treatment, and compare the patients' visual acuity (1 day,&#xD;
      7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months) and The thickness of the center of the macula, compare&#xD;
      and observe its treatment effect.&#xD;

      1. Test method:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Include suitable cases of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema Inclusion&#xD;
                criteria: a. PDR patients with severe vitreous hemorrhage who cannot collect oct&#xD;
                images and require vitrectomy b. Type 2 diabetes, aged 18~80 years old c. Good&#xD;
                blood sugar control (glycated hemoglobin &lt;8.3%) d. Sign the informed consent form&#xD;
                voluntarily, and are willing and able to follow the outpatient visits and research&#xD;
                procedures within the time specified in the trial Exclusion criteria: a. Exclude&#xD;
                severe infections of conjunctiva, cornea, and sclera b. Combined with other retinal&#xD;
                vascular diseases such as retinal vein occlusion c. Cardiorenal insufficiency d.&#xD;
                Myocardial infarction or stroke occurred within 6 months ②Intraoperative real-time&#xD;
                operation All patients underwent 25Gauge(25G) transplanter three-channel vitrectomy&#xD;
                to remove cloudy vitreous or vitreous hemorrhage and posterior vitreous cortex.&#xD;
                Through intraoperative oct, the macular area was observed in real time and the&#xD;
                central macular thickness was measured. If central macular thickness (CMT) ≥ 250&#xD;
                μm, anti-VEGF, glucocorticoid, or internal limiting membrane peeling was randomly&#xD;
                selected to treat macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Re-examine the effect of surgery after operation The visual acuity and the&#xD;
                     thickness of the center of the macula were reviewed at 1 day, 7 days, 1 month,&#xD;
                     3 months, and 6 months after the operation to compare the effect of the&#xD;
                     operation, and observe the cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous cavity, and&#xD;
                     intraocular pressure.&#xD;
