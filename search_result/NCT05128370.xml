  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For several years now, it has been demonstrated that the upper limb plays an important role&#xD;
      in the function of an efficient and balanced gait pattern in healthy adults. After a stroke,&#xD;
      the reduced muscle strength has a clear influence on the gait pattern, but also on the active&#xD;
      movement possibilities of the upper limb. However, the role of the upper limb during gait is&#xD;
      not sufficiently explored in the literature. The gold standard for motion analysis is a 3D&#xD;
      analysis performed with infrared cameras capturing reflective markers during gait.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it is not possible for all people after a stroke to undergo this examination.&#xD;
      On the one hand, patients must already have a certain degree of independence with regard to&#xD;
      gait. On the other hand, not all centers have access to this expensive accommodation. There&#xD;
      are some validated observation scales for people after stroke to describe the gait based on a&#xD;
      2D video image. This method is much more accessible and can be applied by any therapist.&#xD;
      However, to date there has been little attention paid to the upper limb in these observation&#xD;
      scales. Therefore, analogous to the observation scales for gait, an observation scale for the&#xD;
      upper limb during gait was set up. The use of this scale can add value to the rehabilitation&#xD;
      of people after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment team will receive information about the patient's complete movement&#xD;
           pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The arm will be more prominent when setting rehabilitation goals related to gait. This&#xD;
           can lead to a positive effect on the gait pattern itself, but also to more attention&#xD;
           being paid to the arm, which has a more difficult recovery than the leg after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the inter and intra tester reliability of this visual observation scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate if the results of the visual observation scale correlate to a 3D&#xD;
           assessment performed in a subgroup of participants&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be walking for 4x10 m. During this walking a 2D video recording in the frontal&#xD;
      (back and front view) and sagittal plane (left and right sided view) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervision of therapist during walking is allowed. Therapist cannot help the patient during&#xD;
      walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This images will be used to score the visual observation scale (G.A.I.T) and the additional&#xD;
      observation scale developed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subgroup of participants from the Ghent University Hospital, a 3D assessment will be&#xD;
      made on an instrumented treadmill (GRAIL, Motek), which will be used as a golden standard to&#xD;
      compare with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional clinical parameters will be investigated to describe the study group.&#xD;
