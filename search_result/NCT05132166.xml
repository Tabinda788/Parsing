  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an academic open-label, phase II randomized study in patients with steroid resistant&#xD;
      severe acute Graft versus host disease (GvHD) who have had allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Decidual&#xD;
      Stromal Cells (DSC) with Investigators choice best available treatment (BAT). If randomized&#xD;
      to DSC arm, patients will receive 2 infusions in the vein at least one week apart. Additional&#xD;
      doses (up to 4 doses) of DSC may be given depending on response.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Have undergone HSCT from any donor source (unrelated, sibling, haploidentical) using&#xD;
             bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood. Recipients of non-&#xD;

             organs with aGvHD is encouraged and may be performed as per institutional practices at&#xD;
             investigator's discretion for aGvHD management. If performed, the investigator will&#xD;
             indicate the results once available and the results are not required prior to study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Confirmed diagnosis of steroid-refractory aGvHD defined as patients administered high&#xD;
             dose systemic corticosteroids (methylprednisolone ≥1mg/kg/day (±20%) [or equivalent&#xD;
             prednisone dose ≥1.25 mg/kg/day]), given alone or combined with calcineurin inhibitors&#xD;
             (CNI) and either: A. Progression based on organ assessment after at least 3 days&#xD;
             compared to organ stage at the time of initiation of high-dose systemic corticosteroid&#xD;
             +/- CNI for the treatment of Grade II-IV aGvHD, OR B. Failure to achieve at a minimum&#xD;
             partial response based on organ assessment after 5-7 days compared to organ stage at&#xD;
             the time of initiation of high-dose systemic corticosteroid +/- CNI for the treatment&#xD;
             of Grade II-IV aGvHD, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Patients who fail corticosteroid taper defined as fulfilling either one of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Requirement for an increase in the corticosteroid dose to methylprednisolone ≥1&#xD;
             mg/kg/day (or equivalent prednisone dose ≥1.25 mg/kg/day) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Failure to taper the methylprednisolone dose to &lt;0.5 mg/kg/day (or equivalent&#xD;
             prednisone dose &lt;0.6 mg/kg/day) for a minimum 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has received systemic treatment for aGvHD apart from steroids. Standard aGvHD&#xD;
             prophylaxis and treatment medications initiated before randomization including&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) (cyclosporine or tacrolimus),&#xD;
             mycophenolate mofetil, and topical corticosteroid therapy may be continued, per&#xD;
             institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical presentation resembling de novo chronic GvHD or GvHD overlap syndrome with&#xD;
             both acute and chronic GvHD features (as defined by Jagasia, et al. 2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of an active uncontrolled infection including significant bacterial, fungal,&#xD;
             viral or parasitic infection requiring treatment. Infections are considered controlled&#xD;
             if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of screening, no signs of&#xD;
             progression are present. Progression of infection is defined as hemodynamic&#xD;
             instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical signs or&#xD;
             radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs&#xD;

             methylprednisolone (or equivalent prednisone dose 1.25 mg/kg/day) within 7 days of&#xD;
             Screening. Routine corticosteroids administered during conditioning or cell infusion&#xD;
             is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of progressive multifocal leuko-encephalopathy (PML).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous participation in a study of any investigational treatment agent within 30&#xD;
             days or within 5 half-lives of the study treatment, whichever is greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, interfere with full&#xD;
             participation in the study, including administration of study treatment and attending&#xD;
             required study visits; pose a significant risk to the patient; or interfere with&#xD;
             interpretation of study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;
