  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal hypothesizes that mitochondrial bioenergetics in the patient will correspond to&#xD;
      mtDNA DAMPs levels and markers of inflammation. We predict these will serve as a prognostic&#xD;
      indicator of Sepsis induced cardiac dysfunction (SICD) outcomes. Successful completion of&#xD;
      these studies will provide a clearer understanding of the etiology of SICD development and&#xD;
      therefore will have a high impact on biomedical research by identifying a new mechanism for&#xD;
      understanding sepsis induced organ failure. Importantly, they will also provide a means for&#xD;
      more directed and focused therapies, based upon individual&#xD;
      bioenergetic/mitochondrial-mediated inflammation profiles. The combined, complementary&#xD;
      expertise of the Mentor/co-primary investigators (Drs. Mathru and Ballinger) provide an&#xD;
      excellent combination in both basic and translational research. They also have experience&#xD;
      conducting studies and publications that will strengthen this research project. Importantly,&#xD;
      the methods for characterizing mitochondrial bioenergetics from platelets were developed here&#xD;
      at UAB, and methods for quantitative assessment of mtDNA DAMPs have been recently developed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis induced cardiac dysfunction (SICD) occurs in ~ 50% of the patients with severe sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock, with significant implications for patient's survival. Currently, the&#xD;
      precise pathophysiological mechanisms leading to cardiac dysfunction are not fully&#xD;
      understood, nor is there an effective therapy for SICD except antibiotics, source control and&#xD;
      restoration of hemodynamics to improve organ perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SICD is characterized by minimal cell death, normal coronary perfusion, preserved tissue&#xD;
      oxygen tension and reversibility in survivors. These characteristics point toward an oxygen&#xD;
      utilization problem due to mitochondrial dysfunction; interestingly, sepsis mouse models&#xD;
      demonstrated an improvement in cardiac function and decreased mortality when they were&#xD;
      treated with mitochondrial targeted therapies, consistent with a growing body of evidence&#xD;
      that suggests dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of SICD. Ultrastructural and functional abnormalities of mitochondria have also been&#xD;
      demonstrated in early sepsis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from mitochondria&#xD;
      along with calcium overload trigger mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening&#xD;
      which facilitates the externalization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments. These mtDNA&#xD;
      fragments, or mtDNA Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (mtDNA DAMPs), activate innate&#xD;
      immune response pathways - these pathways are well known to be significant components of&#xD;
      intramyocardial inflammation.&#xD;
