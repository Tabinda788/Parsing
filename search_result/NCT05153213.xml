  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial comparing the conventional method of recording&#xD;
      occlusal vertical dimension using Willis gauge from the base of the nose to the base of the&#xD;
      chin with the other method using vernier caliper for the length of the index finger to access&#xD;
      the satisfaction level of edentulous patients acquiring complete dentures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was to apply the anthropometric methods to correlate the length of fingers to&#xD;
      occlusal vertical dimensions and also by using the Willis Method to assess the occlusal&#xD;
      vertical dimension for edentulous patients and assess satisfaction by comparing both the&#xD;
      methods for patients who are in the process of acquiring complete dentures. Furthermore,&#xD;
      conventional methods are applied most commonly for the recording of occlusal vertical&#xD;
      dimensions. This study also bridged the knowledge gap among clinicians to adapt to a&#xD;
      different methodology for recording the VDO using the anthropometric measurement of fingers&#xD;
      which would improve denture satisfaction. Therefore, a total of 71 patients were selected for&#xD;
      this study, having lost their OVD due to the complete absence of teeth and having no history&#xD;
      of maxillofacial or orthognathic surgery, nor any skeletal deformities or disfigurement of&#xD;
      fingers. The measurements were made at the appointment for jaw relations records in which the&#xD;
      length of the fingers was measured with a digital Vernier caliper and also the conventional&#xD;
      methods were applied for recording the occluding vertical dimensions which included recording&#xD;
      the distance from the base of the nose septum (Subnasion - Sn) to the base of the chin&#xD;
      (Menton - Me) (Sn-Me). The length of the index finger (2D) was recorded and a correlation was&#xD;
      found between Sn-Me and finger length.&#xD;
