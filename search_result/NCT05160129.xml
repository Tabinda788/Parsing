  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for people suffering from severe&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) whose symptoms have failed to improve after years and&#xD;
      multiple methods of intervention. An effective DBS target for OCD is the anterior limb of the&#xD;
      internal capsule (ALIC) brain region. On average 60% of all OCD patients have a clinically&#xD;
      significant response to ALIC DBS. However, ALIC DBS may become even more effective with the&#xD;
      ability to predict which specific ALIC connections in the brain need to be stimulated for&#xD;
      each individual OCD patient. This study therefore investigates personalized stimulation to&#xD;
      the ALIC that allows for precise modulation of brain circuits associated with individual OCD&#xD;
      symptoms. The study aims to specify the ideal anatomical target for ALIC DBS for maximum&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit in each patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To improve DBS for severe OCD, the anatomical specificity with which stimulation is delivered&#xD;
      must be enhanced. In this study, patients will receive personalized and circuit specific&#xD;
      stimulation to five target ALIC pathways based on pre-surgery brain scan analysis where&#xD;
      patient-specific blueprints are created and used to determine implant location. Stimulation&#xD;
      to the ALIC is delivered by directional segmented electrodes which are designed to deliver&#xD;
      precise activation of circuits of interest and minimize excess tissue activation that can&#xD;
      cause side effects. In this study, ALIC DBS will target white matter pathways, each having&#xD;
      different cortical projections that affect different behavioral outputs, instead of&#xD;
      traditional targeting. Each of these chosen pathways have been shown to be involved in the&#xD;
      effects of ALIC DBS for OCD, but the results vary between studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study involves routine implantation of bilateral DBS leads into the ALIC brain&#xD;
      region, which are connected to an internal pulse generator (IPG) device that is implanted&#xD;
      under the skin near the collar bone and controls stimulation delivery. Before surgery,&#xD;
      patients will receive a high definition 7T MRI brain scan to carefully plan the personalized&#xD;
      lead implantation. Following surgery, patients will receive routine clinical visits for&#xD;
      optimizing the DBS parameters and monitoring of clinical effects. As part of this study,&#xD;
      patients will participate in EEG recordings at stimulation initiation and after 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. In addition, patients will complete behavioral paradigm testing bimonthly during&#xD;
      stimulation of circuit-specific DBS contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to create a blueprint map of the brain that characterizes pathways&#xD;
      that are found in effective treatment of OCD. This will be done by determining which pathways&#xD;
      are activated by stimulation in different locations in ALIC and linking these locations with&#xD;
      changes in task performance. This will allow for specification of the ideal anatomical target&#xD;
      for DBS for OCD for maximum therapeutic benefit.&#xD;
