      The aim of the present study is to carry out post-marketing clinical monitoring of the&#xD;
      medical device used in accordance with the instructions for use according to a medical&#xD;
      strategy intended for the person who is suitable for this research which is not fixed in&#xD;
      advance by an investigation plan and is part of the current practice of the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparative, prospective, multicenter observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The osteointegration reached between 2 and 6 months after surgery will be evaluated by&#xD;
      clinical and radiological examinations:&#xD;
