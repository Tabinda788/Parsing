    <textblock>
      This 4-year study will randomize 1,000 people with co-occurring opioid use and mental health&#xD;
      disorders (COD) at medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) clinics to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MISSION, a multi-component team approach, or its components with MOUD versus&#xD;
      MOUD alone, as well as the incremental benefits of MISSION or its components for improving&#xD;
      outcomes. We expect that individuals receiving MISSION or its parts + MOUD will show greater&#xD;
      improvement over MOUD alone on: engagement, substance use, and mental health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-year, 5-arm randomized control trial with a fractional factorial design among&#xD;
      1,000 patients across 9 MOUD programs. Patients will be randomized to: 1) MOUD alone; 2) full&#xD;
      MISSION (CTI &amp; DRT &amp; PS) + MOUD; 3) CTI &amp; DRT + MOUD; 4) PS &amp; DRT + MOUD; or 5) CTI &amp; PS +&#xD;
      MOUD (Arms 3-5 are the 3 combinations of 2 MISSION parts). MISSION is a time-limited, cross&#xD;
      disciplinary, team-based wraparound approach that provides 6 months of psychosocial treatment&#xD;
      combined with assertive outreach, empowering clients to access and engage in care and&#xD;
      community services to promote recovery. The MISSION treatment curriculum integrates 3&#xD;
      evidence-based practices along with MOUD: 1) Critical Time Intervention (CTI), a time-limited&#xD;
      form of assertive community treatment; 2) Dual Recovery Therapy (DRT), which is integrated&#xD;
      mental health and substance use group therapy; and 3) Peer Support (PS), offering support for&#xD;
      people in recovery by people in recovery. Participants will receive 6 months of treatment and&#xD;
      be followed for 1-year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of MISSION or its bundled parts with MOUD versus MOUD&#xD;
      alone, as well as the incremental benefits of MISSION and its parts + MOUD to improve&#xD;
      outcomes 1a-c for CODs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: Individuals receiving MISSION or its parts + MOUD will show greater&#xD;
      improvement over MOUD alone on: 1a. Engagement (measured by total days in treatment,&#xD;
      percentage of days receiving MOUD, and total number of outreach and linkages sessions); 1b.&#xD;
      Opioid use and other substance use (measured by self-report days of use and drug screens);&#xD;
      and 1c. Mental health (measured by self-report mental health symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: MISSION + MOUD will outperform its parts + MOUD but at least one of the three&#xD;
      combinations + MOUD will be at least 75% as effective compared to the full MISSION protocol&#xD;
      on outcomes 1a-c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine mechanisms of action of MISSION in CODs. Hypothesis 2.1: The effects of&#xD;
      MISSION and its bundled parts on health outcomes (mental health, opioid and other substance&#xD;
      use) are mediated by treatment participation and other measures (e.g., recovery capital,&#xD;
      psychosocial supports, and quality of life). Hypothesis 2.2: The effects of MISSION and its&#xD;
      parts on health outcomes are moderated by key patient characteristics (e.g., demographics,&#xD;
      severity of COD, and MOUD type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To conduct a comprehensive economic evaluation of MISSION or its bundled parts and&#xD;
      MOUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate cost of full MISSION or its bundled parts compared to MOUD alone, and to evaluate&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and return on investment from multiple perspectives, including patient,&#xD;
      clinic, healthcare, taxpayer, and societal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: 4. To construct a predictive model that can match optimum combined use of&#xD;
      MISSION parts with specific patient's needs for greater improvements in health outcomes,&#xD;
      which will inform a future randomized controlled trial on cost-effective patient-level&#xD;
      precision intervention assignment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are 18 years-old and older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are fluent in English or Spanish;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have OUD who (a) are newly admitted into the program with OUD; or (b) who have been&#xD;
             active in the program for the treatment of OUD with medications like buprenorphine or&#xD;
             naltrexone, but experienced a recent relapse with any substance (e.g., alcohol,&#xD;
             cocaine, opioids, or benzodiazepines). This second group is necessary to include&#xD;
             because patients who may have been stable for a long period of time may have a relapse&#xD;
             and need intensive treatment to help them regain their abstinence and facilitate the&#xD;
             path towards recovery. Thus, by taking those newly enrolled and those who were stable&#xD;
             on MOUD but had a recent relapse, the second group is clinically similar to the first&#xD;
             group and the intervention will be meaningful.;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potentially have a concurrent substance use disorder in addition to opioids; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a co-occurring mental health disorder (COD) including depression, anxiety,&#xD;
             trauma-related disorders, bipolar, and/or schizophrenia, and those who are stable on&#xD;
             buprenorphine or naltrexone but have recurrence or worsening at any time of symptoms&#xD;
             of any co-occurring mental health disorder (COD) including depression, anxiety,&#xD;
             trauma-related disorders, bipolar, and/or schizophrenia, even if the patient has not&#xD;
             relapsed. Instability is defined in two ways in the study: (a) a substance use&#xD;
             relapse; and (b) recurrence to symptom exacerbation in regard to a subject's mental&#xD;
             health disorder(s). If subjects do not meet criteria for &quot;a&quot; (i.e., not having a&#xD;
             substance use relapse), but they do meet criteria for &quot;b&quot; (i.e., they do in fact have&#xD;
             worsening of mental health symptoms), they are then defined as unstable, and will meet&#xD;
             study inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are not fluent in English or Spanish;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are acutely psychotic, acutely suicidal with a plan, or homicidal;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are incompetent and unable to provide informed consent; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have concurrent severe alcohol use disorder or high dose benzodiazepine needing&#xD;
             detoxification. This exclusion factor is based on DSM-5 criteria, and those who are&#xD;
             currently drinking or with a history of severe alcohol withdrawal (i.e., alcohol&#xD;
             related seizures, and delirium tremens) will also be excluded. High dose&#xD;
             benzodiazepine is defined as using Lorazepam equivalent of &gt; 10 mg/day; Diazepam &gt; 100&#xD;
             mg/day; Clonazepam 5 mg/ day; Alprazolam 5 mg/day.&#xD;
