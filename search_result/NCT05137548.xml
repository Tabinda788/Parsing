  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, open-label, 2-cohort, multiple dose, fixed-sequence, DDI study&#xD;
      in healthy adult subjects. Healthy volunteers will be administered multiple oral doses of&#xD;
      ATI-2173 in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and assessed for safety and&#xD;
      tolerability including blood tests to show how the body metabolizes and eliminates the&#xD;
      investigational drug as well as how the investigational drug interacts with tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate.&#xD;
