  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility and acceptability study for 4- week virtual mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention with social support for perinatal individuals at higher risk for substance use.&#xD;
      This study builds on the longitudinal collection of questionnaire data from pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each closed virtual support group will meet&#xD;
      weekly for 4 weeks using a video conference platform. Groups will be focused on grounding,&#xD;
      thinking patterns, self-compassion and self-care. This approach will foster increase&#xD;
      awareness of wellbeing as well as social support between group participants. Primary outcomes&#xD;
      include the feasibility and acceptability of this group-based intervention for perinatal&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;

    <description>The virtual mindfulness-based intervention with social support groups will meet once a week for 4 weeks, each session will be 60 minutes. Each group will have 3-8 participants. The groups will be closed, meaning the same group of participants meet with the same instructor (unless a backup instructor is needed due to unavoidable reasons). Groups will be completed using the video conferencing application.</description>
