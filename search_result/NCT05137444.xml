  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase Ⅱ trial adopts a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design to evaluate&#xD;
      the immunogenicity and safety profile of LYB001 in healthy adults aged 18 years and older.&#xD;
      This Phase III study adopts a single-arm, open-label design to evaluate the expanded safety&#xD;
      of LYB001 in healthy subjects 18 years of age and older. The study vaccine will be&#xD;
      administered IM at upper arm deltoid as a three-dose regimen with 28d interval on day 0, 28,&#xD;
      56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase Ⅱ trial will be carried out in an age-sequential enrolment manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A DSMB meeting will be held after the completion of the 7-day safety observation&#xD;
           following each vaccination of high-dose LYB001 or placebo in participants aged 18-59&#xD;
           years in phase Ⅰ trial. Thereafter, the DSMB will recommend whether to initiate&#xD;
           enrollment of younger adult participants in the Phase II trial based on the findings,&#xD;
           who will receive low dose (25μg), high dose (50μg) LYB001 or placebo at a ratio of&#xD;
           3:3:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A DSMB meeting will be held after the completion of the 7-day safety observation&#xD;
           following each vaccination of high-dose LYB001 or placebo in participants aged ≥60 year&#xD;
           in phase Ⅰ trial. Thereafter, the DSMB will recommend whether to initiate enrollment of&#xD;
           older adult participants in the Phase II trial based on the findings, who will receive&#xD;
           low dose (25μg), high dose (50μg) LYB001 or placebo at a ratio of 3:3:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The phase Ⅱ trial will be ended after all participants completed 360-day safety&#xD;
           observation following the 3rd dose of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III trial (the expanded safety study):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After completion of the 7-day safety observation following the first immunization of all&#xD;
           cohorts in the Phase II trial, a DSMB meeting will be held to recommend whether to&#xD;
           initiate enrollment of participants in the Phase III trial. A total of 1200 subjects&#xD;
           will be enrolled in younger adult and older adults, with older adults accounting for&#xD;
           ≥20% of the population, and appropriate doses will be determined based on the results of&#xD;
           early clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The phase III trial will be ended after all participants completed 360-day safety&#xD;
           observation following the 3rd dose of vaccination.&#xD;
