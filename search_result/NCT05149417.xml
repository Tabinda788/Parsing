      This study is a seven day three-arm parallel group trial . Participants inculded are aged&#xD;
      more than 16 years old who presented to the ED for minor trauma and discharged with analgesic&#xD;
      treatment. They are randomized to one of two trial TM intervention groups (SMS and TM) or&#xD;
      usual care group (control) in a 1 :1 :1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all inculded patients, demographic characteristics were collected as well as clinical&#xD;
      examination findings. The interventional care provided at the ED was mentioned. At ED&#xD;
      discharge the pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was evaluated and the analgesic treatment&#xD;
      prescribed was noted.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Included patients were randomized to one of the 3 groups:&#xD;
Usual care (control) group Patients enrolled in this group were discharged and they didn't undergo any intervention within the treatment period.&#xD;
SMS group Or short message service (SMS) group: patients received SMS at day 2 every day to remind them to take their treatment .&#xD;
Telemonitoring group:&#xD;
Patients received a phone call on day 2 and day 4 to evaluate the adherence , to detect any problem that can affect the adherence to the treatment and modify the analgesic protocol treatment if needed according to an algorithm:&#xD;
At each call (day 2 and day 4), the VAS was assessed. If VAS â‰¥ 3 we looked for a medication discontinuation, inadequate dose or change of the prescribed treatment and the patient was instructed to take action accordingly . If the problem is related to side effects, the analgesic treatment was changed or associated to another analgesic</intervention_model_description>
