  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the latest published literature reviews, stroke patients have a prevalence of&#xD;
      19.5% of minor depression and 21.7% of major depression. Furthermore, the loss of autonomy is&#xD;
      the most strongly correlated variable in these emotional disorders. In addition, emotional&#xD;
      disturbances - in particular anxiety, sadness, crying, and anhedonia - are interpreted as&#xD;
      natural reactions to the loss of physical capacity. Along these lines, it has been shown that&#xD;
      the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a co-adjuvant therapy of neuro-rehabilitation in stroke&#xD;
      patients with emotional disorders decreases the incidence of these disorders.&#xD;

      . Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the impact on mood, anxiety and depression in patients admitted to&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation units after the use of non-immersive virtual reality with the Nintento&#xD;
      Switch device in their rehabilitation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the emotional state of patients before the use of non-immersive virtual&#xD;
           therapy in their rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the emotional state of patients after the use of virtual reality in their&#xD;
           rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the emotional state of patients before and after the implementation of&#xD;
           virtual therapy in their rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the emotional state of patients who have not used non-immersive virtual&#xD;
           reality in their rehabilitation by choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the involvement of the use of virtual reality therapy in&#xD;

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Each has between three and five possible answers, with a score of 0-2 or 0-4 respectively. The total score ranges from 0 to 52. They can use different cut-off points when classifying the depressive picture. The Clinical Practice Guide prepared by NICE [6], a guide with a high overall quality in its preparation and a score of &quot;highly recommended&quot; according to the AGREE instrument, use the following cut-off points:&#xD;
Not depressed: 0-7 Mild / minor depression: 8-13 Moderate depression: 14-18 Severe depression: 19-22 Very severe depression:&gt; 23</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Rating for Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>to assess the intensity or severity of depression in patients already diagnosed in an estimated time of 10 minutes. Quantitatively assess the severity of symptoms and possible changes. Its original version consists of 21 items and its reduced version 17 items.This scale consists of different questions with 3 and 5 possible answers and which are scored with 0-2 or 0-4, their maximum score is 0-52. Possible outcomes are: not depressed (0-7 points), mild / minor depression (8-13 points), moderate depression (14-18 points), severe depression (19-22 points) and very severe depression (&gt; 23 points (66.67).</description>

    <measure>Mood Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Each item is valued from 0 to 10 points depending on the value chosen by the person, after directly adding the score of the four adjectives corresponding to each subscale and dividing the sum by 4, four scores between 0 and 10 are obtained that quantify the states sad-depressive, anxious, happy and angry-hostile mood of the person checked at the time the scale was performed.</description>

    <measure>Mississippi Aphasia Screening Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The linguistic alterations that occur are the language disorders after the stroke are frequent and include aphasia, alexia, agraphy and calculations, for their detection this scale will be used.</description>

    <description>Measures the level of functional independence with neuromuscular and / or neuromusculoskeletal diseases, extending its use in assessing the degree 35&#xD;
development of ABVD, as a prognostic indicator and allocation method of resources. Maximum score: 100 points (90 if you are in a wheelchair) &lt;20 points: total dependence. 40-55 points: moderate dependence. 100 points: independence. 20-35 points: severe dependence.&#xD;
