      This study is a prospective, post-market, multi-center clinical investigation of the&#xD;
      Insignia™ Hip Stem for primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) in a consecutive&#xD;
      series of patients who meet the eligibility criteria. The total enrollment goal for the study&#xD;
      is a minimum of 313 cases, all of which will receive the Insignia™ Hip Stem.&#xD;

Scores can range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best score.&#xD;
A score of 80-100 is considered good-excellent and a score of less than or equal to 79 is considered fair-poor. 90-100 = excellent 80-89 = good 70-79 = fair 0-69 = poor</description>

    <description>The EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) is a subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess subject health state values.&#xD;
The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility self care, usual activities, pain/comfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels indicating no problems, some problems or extreme problems. The index values on a scale between -1 (low) and 1 (high) are showing the average health status according to the 5 dimensions: A low score shows worse health and a high score shows better health.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) is a subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess subject health state values.&#xD;
With the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) the respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>
