    <description>Final effectiveness will be evaluated as 'improved', 'unchanged', 'aggravated' or 'unassessable' based on the physician's evaluation of the overall participant's disease related factors after 24 weeks. 'Improved' will be if determined as there is any effect of maintaining or improving disease related factors, 'unchanged' will be if disease related factors have not been changed compared with before administration, and not determined as there is any effect of maintaining symptoms. 'Aggravated' will be if disease related factors are worse than before administration and 'unassessable' will be if it cannot be determined due to insufficient information collected. 'Improved', 'unchanged', 'aggravated' will be further categorized as 'effective' ('improved') and 'ineffective' ('unchanged' and 'aggravated').</description>
