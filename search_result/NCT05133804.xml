  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up-to-date, no studies have examined the attentional, sensory and emotional processing&#xD;
      (difficulties) among patients diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In&#xD;
      addition, the efficiency of drug treatments that focus on the noradrenergic and dopaminergic,&#xD;
      and thus influence attention processing and PTSD symptoms through these pathways, have only&#xD;
      briefly been investigated. There is well-established and long-standing evidence for the&#xD;
      involvement of dopamine and noradrenaline in attentional function. This previously led to an&#xD;
      investigation by our lab in which we hypothesized the involvement of an attentional disorder&#xD;
      would influence PTSD symptoms in a rat model. Based on these results, the current study aims&#xD;
      to characterize attentional deficits in patients with PTSD, as well as the correlation&#xD;
      between attention, emotional regulation and sensory processing. We do this partially by&#xD;
      conducting a case-control study and through a subsequent double-blind RCT (with only the&#xD;
      cases). The patients will be either treated with reboxetine + methylphenidate or placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly impairing psychiatric disorder,&#xD;
      characterized by re-experiencing, avoidance behaviour, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal&#xD;
      after traumatic exposure. Current treatments mainly focus on non-cognitive symptoms and are&#xD;
      only partially effective: one third of PTSD patients will find symptoms to be chronic and&#xD;
      progressive; highly impacting daily function and quality of life. Arising evidence suggests a&#xD;
      correlation between impaired attention, sensory dysfunction, and PTSD symptoms. Thus, the&#xD;
      importance of combined treatment, focused on concentration difficulties as often found PTSD,&#xD;
      has been suggested. Two suggested leads are reboxetine and methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesising that impaired attentional and sensory processing induces re-experiencing with&#xD;
      avoidance and hyperarousal as coping strategies, we aim to elucidate the neuro-dysregulation&#xD;
      characteristics of each of the PTSD symptoms, with focus on attention, executive function and&#xD;
      sensory processing, and relate to their implications on daily life function, following a&#xD;
      novel combined treatment strategy of reboxetine and methylphenidate (Ritalin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case-control study will be conducted, including 53adult patients with PTSD and 53 matched&#xD;
      healthy controls. First, a baseline measure will be performed amongst all participants to&#xD;
      create a population profile. Then, patients will be randomised into an active treatment group&#xD;
      (n=27) and a placebo group (n=26) for a double-blind randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      investigating the effect of a 3-week treatment with reboxetine 4mg per day and a one-week&#xD;
      addition of Ritalin 10mg twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will include established and innovative neurophysiological measures and&#xD;
      questionnaires. A PTSD symptom profile will be created combining the Clinician-Administered&#xD;
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale. Brain&#xD;
      activity will be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR) or&#xD;
      electroencephalography, with the Auditory Sustained Attention Test (ASAT) and Electrodermal&#xD;
      Activity (EDA). Together with the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale - Short Version, the ASAT&#xD;
      and EDA will create an attentional profile. Furthermore, a sensory profile consisting of the&#xD;
      Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile Questionnaire, and an executive function profile measured&#xD;
      with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function will be created. Finally, in order&#xD;
      to relate to individual experiences in real-life context, this research measures activities&#xD;
      through the Daily Living Questionnaire and quality of life with the World Health Organization&#xD;
      Quality of Life Instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a translational research paradigm, this research is one of the first to investigate&#xD;
      neuro-dysregulation in PTSD with a focus on sensory processing and executive function, with&#xD;
      emphasis on attention and behaviour. It is also the first research to integrate the fNIR with&#xD;
      the ASAT and EDA, thus contributing to the technological advancing of clinical research. Our&#xD;
      research will gather innovative data that may offer new explanations of PTSD symptoms and&#xD;
      allow for further development of treatment interventions needed to reduce the burden of&#xD;
      disease and optimise quality of life.&#xD;
