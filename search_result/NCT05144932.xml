  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open, multicenter, prospective, singel-arm study will evaluate usability and feasibility&#xD;
      of a wearable stroke indication system (Stroke Alarm) in patients with recent TIA, recent&#xD;
      minor stroke without persistent arm motor deficit, or atrial fibrillation up to 1 month.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of the CE-marked wearable system&#xD;
      for early stroke indication to indicate the onset of stroke in real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the device is well tolerated with an acceptable number of adverse&#xD;
      events such as direct complications of the bracelets or unbearable amounts of false alarms or&#xD;
      false alarms during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device can be used to monitor arm motor function for long time. The ability to detect arm&#xD;
      paresis (indicating the onset of a stroke) will be studied as well, but the trial is&#xD;
      single-armed and not designed to assess neither the efficacy of stroke indication nor&#xD;
      shortened patient-delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated adverse device effects that are to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants being unable to operate the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of alarms specified for the different alarm escalation steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  User compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  User experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alarm recipient experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers for use will be identified (for example advanced age or other patients'&#xD;
           characteristics)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective trial without a comparator group (single arm). All patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of stroke (ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage) or TIA or newly diagnosed&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation/flutter at the participating hospitals are screened daily (Monday -&#xD;
      Friday) for eligibility by dedicated research nurses, mainly through the electronic patient&#xD;
      chart (Melior). Atrial fibrillation patients may also be identtifyed using the Auricula&#xD;
      registry for oral anticoagulation. When in doubt about the diagnosis or eligibility for other&#xD;
      reasons research nurses consult either the physician responsible for the patient or the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients screened are documented, including reasons for non-inclusion and exclusion. The&#xD;
      screening log is kept in the Investigators site file (ISF) that are located in locked&#xD;
      research offices at the participating hospitals. Source data such as inclusion forms are&#xD;
      stored in the same research offices, within locked cabinets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients are contacted by a research nurse at one month from inclusion (plus&#xD;
      maximum 14 days) for a planned follow-up phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up appointments are scheduled by phone/letter, but prior to the visit, a notice&#xD;
      will be sent, and the patient is encouraged to complete the questionnaire before the visit&#xD;
      and is also informed that it is possible to complete the questionnaire during the follow-up.&#xD;
      Interpreter-assistance or use of questionnaires translated to foreign languages is allowed&#xD;
      during the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up is estimated to take one hour. Prior to the follow-up the electronic journal is&#xD;
      checked for any admissions for stroke or TIA during the follow-up period and in such case any&#xD;
      arm motor involvement and the time from onset to arrival to hospital is also registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the follow-up, a structured reporting form is used (StrokeAlarm Pro CRF). Baseline data&#xD;
      for all patients are registered in the CRF at inclusion and/or at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research nurse fills in the CRF at inclusion and follow-up and enters the data into SPSS.&#xD;
      The PI validates the CRF items in SPSS using cross control and frequencies analysis of number&#xD;
      of answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the device backend server is extracted by a predefined format (Structured Backend&#xD;
      Data Report StrokeAlarm Pro DRF) into the SPSS data file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses are made on pseudoanonymized data (personal identification number replaced by serial&#xD;
      number). A key will be kept in a locked research room at the hospital throughout the course&#xD;
      of the study and the analytic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS will be used for all statistical analyses. Data will be summarized and presented with&#xD;
      descriptive statistics and graphs, as well as linear models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are in this clinical trial instructed to use the device continuously for 1&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No comparator will be used in this clinical trial. The main reason is that there are no&#xD;
      similar systems available. Feasibility is the main research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient that are participating in this clinical trial will receive one pair of devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices are paired and designed for continuous use for up to 6 months. For hygienic&#xD;
      reasons the devices will not be re-used for other subjects. The devices will be collected by&#xD;
      the manufacturer at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2.1 Other medical device or medication to be used during the clinical investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous inclusion in other studies that require bracelets are not permitted since this&#xD;
      may negatively impact the user experience. Simultaneous inclusion in other ongoing studies on&#xD;
      for example drugs, is permitted.&#xD;
