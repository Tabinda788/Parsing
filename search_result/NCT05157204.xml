  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic. It is mainly manifested as pneumonia which may&#xD;
      deteriorate into severe respiratory failure. The major hallmark of the disease is the&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory immune response characterized by Cytokine Storm (CS). CS is marked by&#xD;
      elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, tumour&#xD;
      necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Of these, IL-6 is found to be&#xD;
      significantly associated with higher mortality. IL-6 is also a robust marker for predicting&#xD;
      disease prognosis and deterioration of clinical profile. (1) IL-6 was detectable in the&#xD;
      breath condensate of all the healthy non-smokers, but was significantly higher in the COPD&#xD;
      patient. Exhaled breath condensate is totally non-invasive and highly acceptable to patients.&#xD;
      The collection procedure has no effect on airway function or inflammation, and there is&#xD;
      growing evidence that abnormalities in condensate composition may reflect biochemical changes&#xD;
      in airway lining fluid. This method has been successfully used in previous studies to&#xD;
      investigate several inflammatory markers in COPD and asthmatic patients. (2) Il-6 is produced&#xD;
      in the lung by interstitial fibroblasts, alveolar macrophages, and large-vessel and bronchial&#xD;
      epithelial cells. IL-6 levels are high in chronic inflammatory conditions of the lung, such&#xD;
      as those due to allogeneic transplantation, bleomycin-induced fibrosis and a variety of human&#xD;
      interstitial lung diseases. High levels of IL-6 have been found in the induced sputum of&#xD;
      patients with COPD, particularly during exacerbation. Park et al. found increased IL-6 levels&#xD;
      in the Bronchioalveolar lavage fluid of patients with non-specific interstitial&#xD;
      pneumonia/fibrosis and in some patients with interstitial pneumonia. (3) the study involved&#xD;
      20 healthy controls and 20 patients with moderate to severe covid-19 according to cdc&#xD;
      classifaction and 20 patients post covid-19 with lung fibrosis to estimate the measurment of&#xD;
      interleukin-6 at exhaled condensate, this clinical randomized control study consists of 3&#xD;
      arms for 6 month ( all participants above 18 years non prgnant humans )&#xD;

      pneumonia/fibrosis and in some patients with interstitial pneumonia. (3) Dowlati et al. have&#xD;
      reported increased levels of IL-6 in the serum and BAL fluid of patients with lung cancer.&#xD;
      (4) A recent study by Bhowmik et al. found increased IL-6 and IL-8 levels in the sputum of&#xD;
      COPD patients with frequent exacerbations. (5) Also, at another study Exhaled interleukin-6&#xD;
      and leukotriene B4 levels may be useful noninvasive markers of airway inflammation in&#xD;
      cigarette smokers. (6) These studies and our novel method after clinical trials may open the&#xD;
      field for future therapies for covid-19 and post covid-19 lung fibrosis by inhaler transport&#xD;
      medicines as a new challenge for overcome sequels of this pandemic. And this suggested new&#xD;
      procedure for measurement of exhaled il-6 take us to study which is IL-6 is risky is IL-6&#xD;
      produced from airway or endocrine IL-6 or immune IL-6 From previous studies we need a&#xD;
      procedure acceptable to patients and easy, noninvasive, sensitive he study involved 20&#xD;
      healthy controls and 20 patients with moderate to severe covid-19 according to cdc&#xD;
      classifaction and 20 patients post covid-19 with lung fibrosis to estimate the measurment of&#xD;
