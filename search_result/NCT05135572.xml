  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Widespread pain is observed in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and lower extremity and&#xD;
      foot pain are also common. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between foot&#xD;
      pain and tarsal tunnel syndrome in female patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia.&#xD;

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures several patient characteristics over the past week: physical functioning, work status, depression, anxiety, morning tiredness, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being.The total FIQ score ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicate severe effects of FMS. The minimal clinical important difference (MCID) for FIQ was reported to be minimum 14% or 8.1-point improvement</description>

    <measure>Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scala measures the type of pain, whether it has changed over time, and whether the pain is in one or more regions.This scala measures the type of pain, whether it has changed over time, and whether the pain is in one or more regions. It consists of 12 questions. Each question is scored between 0 and 100 points. It is multiplied by the coefficients determined for each question. All the resulting values are summed up, including fixed numbers. The result of the sum reflects the discriminant function score. Individuals with a score below 0 are predicted to have non-neuropathic pain, while those with a score of 0 or higher are predicted to have neuropathic pain</description>
