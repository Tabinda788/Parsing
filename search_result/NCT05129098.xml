  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the concept of physiological pacing has emerged in the clinical practice, in an&#xD;
      attempt to prevent the deteriorating effects of right ventricular pacing in the long-term.&#xD;
      Left bundle branch pacing seems to be a safe procedure with promising results that may&#xD;
      prevent intraventricular dyssynchony compared with the conventional right ventricular pacing.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized study the outcomes regarding echocardiographic indices of&#xD;
      dyssynchrony in left bundle branch versus conventional right ventricular pacing in patients&#xD;
      with atrioventricular node disease will be compared In recent years, His pacing has&#xD;
      demonstrated better results regarding resynchronization compared to conventional&#xD;
      biventricular pacing in trials of 3D mapping. However, technical difficulties that relate to&#xD;
      unstable lead positioning or inability in succeeding low pacing threshold have led to low&#xD;
      success rates. An alternative site of physiological pacing that could possibly overcome these&#xD;
      issues, while maintaining ventricular synchrony is left bundle branch pacing. The lead&#xD;
      implantation of LBB pacing is performed using the Select Secure (3830) pacing lead. The lead&#xD;
      is screwed into the interventricular septum, until left bundle branch pacing is achieved. The&#xD;
      randomized patients 24 hours after the procedure are echocardiographically evaluated and&#xD;
      indices of mechanical dyssynchrony are recorded. Follow-up is conducted at 3 months, 6 months&#xD;
      and one year post-procedure.&#xD;
