  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of BINTRAFUSP ALFA in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy will be assessed in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer&#xD;
      undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BINTRAFUSP ALFA (M7824) is a bifunctional fusion protein that combines an anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      and the extracellular domain of TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) as a TGFβ neutralizing 'trap',&#xD;
      into a single molecule. The novel design of BINTRAFUSP ALFA (M7824), which neutralizes TGFβ&#xD;
      and simultaneously inhibits the anti-PD-L1 pathway in the tumor microenvironment, may be more&#xD;
      effective than agents targeting PD-L1 and TGFβ separately. In this trial, approximately 33&#xD;
      total patients are expected to be enrolled. The first phase of the study will be the safety&#xD;
      lead in in 6 patients with advanced stage (stage III-IV) ovarian cancer undergoing&#xD;
      neoadjuvant settings. Then 27 patients will be enrolled and randomized in 2:1 design to&#xD;
      received standard chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel +/- M7824 respectively (N=18:9).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized so that there will be 24 PD-evaluable participants treated&#xD;
      with standard of care chemotherapy plus BINTRAFUSP ALFA and 9 participants treated with&#xD;
      standard of care chemotherapy at the end of the study. The control arm is strictly for&#xD;
      comparison of the exploratory endpoints, although the primary and secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      presented for both arms, separately. The goal of including 9 patients in the control group is&#xD;
      for comparison of the translational endpoint and not the clinical endpoint. For both&#xD;
      regimens: M7824 (2400 mg flat dose iv on day 1 every 21 days) with chemotherapy including&#xD;
      carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on day 1 of 21-day cycle. Interval debulking&#xD;
      surgery will be planned after 4 cycles. Chemotherapy will be planned for 6-8 cycles then&#xD;
      maintenance M7824 will be continued for at 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>A Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity (assessed in accordance with NCI CTCAE v 5.0), clearly attributable to Bintrafusp alfa (experimental agent) which cause any immune-related grade 3 or grade 4, or recurrent grade 2 toxicities, requiring discontinuation of Bintrafusp alfa or treatment delay for more than 4 weeks.&#xD;
The criteria for stopping will be P(P(DLT)&gt;0.2)&gt;0.66, which will be evaluated after every 5 patients on the chemotherapy plus Bintrafusp alfa arm have completed their safety observation period (four cycles). The probability statement will be assessed using a beta-binomial rule with a prior that assumes unacceptable toxicity will occur in 10% of patients (α=1 and β=9).</description>
