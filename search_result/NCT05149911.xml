  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a widespread epidemic of distress and burnout (i.e., extreme distress) among&#xD;
      Canadian physicians. Burnout is costly to physicians, patients, and healthcare organizations&#xD;
      as it compromises physicians' own health and reduces their capacity to deliver high quality,&#xD;
      safe care to patients. Life coaching delivered by certified coaches is a personal development&#xD;
      tool. Life coaching has been proven to help individuals maximize their strengths and skills&#xD;
      to handle stressors, regain control over their lives, act according to their core values, and&#xD;
      achieve their full potential, consequently reducing their vulnerability to burnout. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate life coaching for physicians' well-being in the current Canadian&#xD;
      context. Physicians from centres in Canada will be randomly assigned to life coaching&#xD;
      (intervention) or no coaching (control) group. The coaching group will receive a 1-hour&#xD;
      initial coaching session followed by five 30-minute coaching sessions occurring at a&#xD;
      frequency of every 2 to 3 weeks within 5 months (total of 3.5 coaching hours). All coaching&#xD;
      sessions will be delivered virtually by certified life coaches. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      the impact of coaching on physician distress and quality of life before and after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the coaching group will receive a 1-hour initial professional coaching session followed by five 30-minute professional coaching sessions occurring at a goal frequency of every 2 to 3 weeks within 5 months (total of 3.5 coaching hours). All coaching sessions will be conducted individually (i.e. between one coach and one participant). Participants will be able to request coaching on any topic to individualize the intervention, but the general structure of the sessions will be standardized across participants. All coaching sessions will be performed over the phone or virtual web meeting as standard in coaching practices.</description>

Participants in the control group will receive the life coaching intervention after the statistical analysis is completed.</description>
