    <textblock>
      Covid-19 disease, originated by SARS-Cov-2 Coronavirus, officially appeared in Italy in&#xD;
      February 2020. Children and adolescents, in most cases, have an asymptomatic or&#xD;
      paucisymptomatic clinical picture and are very rarely hospitalized. Precisely because of the&#xD;
      modest symptoms presented, information on the natural history of Covid19 disease and its&#xD;
      symptomatology is still limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because almost all children with Covid19 are treated by community medicine, family&#xD;
      pediatricians are the most suitable figures to collect the clinical history of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding the mode of infection and spread at both the intrafamily and school&#xD;
      levels is also poor, and the role that the opening of schools may have on the spread of&#xD;
      infection is not yet well established. However, scientific evidence supports the adverse&#xD;
      effect of school closures on the physical and mental health of children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of school spread in a specific area can therefore contribute to increased knowledge&#xD;
      about the role of schools, and such information may be useful in guiding health policy&#xD;
      choices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Covid-19 disease, caused by the coronavirus Sars-Cov-2, officially appeared in Italy in&#xD;
      February 2020. As of January 2020, the first pediatric cases had already been described,&#xD;
      initially in China and then in other countries. Clinical studies suggest that children are&#xD;
      susceptible at any age and can transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus; for the most part pediatric&#xD;
      studies analyzed hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mainly children and young people present asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic symptoms, and very&#xD;
      rarely require hospitalization: the biological reasons for this different clinical picture&#xD;
      compared to the adult population are not clear. Just because of the modest symptomatology&#xD;
      presented in pediatric age, the natural history of Covid-19 disease and its clinical features&#xD;
      in pediatric age are not well known and the disease may be underdiagnosed. Equally scarce is&#xD;
      information about Covid-19 spread both within the family and in school communities. These&#xD;
      data depend on the availability of tests for the identification of Sars-CoV-2 infection and&#xD;
      on how population screenings are organized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, knowledge about clinical aspects and diffusion of Covid-19 within the family and at&#xD;
      school are fundamental to orient health policy choices such as the opening of schools and of&#xD;
      social, educational and sports spaces for children and young people. It is known that&#xD;
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur in school settings, but there are still no definitive&#xD;
      data on the impact that this transmission may have on the spread of the infection within the&#xD;
      population, because school closures always coincide with closures of other activities and&#xD;
      often with general restrictions on the movement of people. Several studies suggest that&#xD;
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at school is not frequent. School contributes a modest number to&#xD;
      the total number of cases and in many cases the infection is attributable to the school&#xD;
      staff. Also, the presence of multiple cases in the same school may depend on a greater spread&#xD;
      of the virus in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence confirms adverse effect of school closures on the physical and mental&#xD;
      health of children and young people, with a very high cost considering impact on learning and&#xD;
      reduction of skills in the long term: any reduction in school hours has negative effects on&#xD;
      students' cognitive abilities, on the probability of dropping out of school, on college&#xD;
      enrollment, and on employment outcomes. In addition, distance learning has exacerbated&#xD;
      inequality, because access to computers and the internet is much more complicated for lower&#xD;
      class families. Moreover, in some contexts, school closure has generated increases in&#xD;
      domestic violence and situations of toxic prolonged stress for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The network of community medicine, formed by family pediatricians, represents a unique&#xD;
      resource to study Covid-19 natural history in children and spread of disease in their family&#xD;
      and at school within a specific territory.&#xD;
