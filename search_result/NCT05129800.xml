  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative retrospective study of the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma injections&#xD;
      and injections with commercial products advertised to promote hair regrowth for patients with&#xD;
      androgenetic alopecia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used for more than a decade in the treatment of&#xD;
      androgenetic alopecia and hair loss. Platelets contain a range of growth factors , namely&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) which stimulate and support hair&#xD;
      growth. Several studies have been performed on patients with conflicting but generally&#xD;
      positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesotherapy is the technique of injecting a product into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue&#xD;
      in order to rejuvenate the skin, induce lipolysis or promote hair growth. Various products&#xD;
      exist with different formulations marketed to induce hair growth and sustain hair loss. Even&#xD;
      though these products have been used for years, clinical evidence is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective study, we will compare the efficacy of PRP and mesotherapy on hair&#xD;
      growth based on the trichoscopic photos and phototrichographic analyses of our patients who&#xD;
      underwent these procedures between 2011 and 2020.&#xD;

    <description>PRP preparation involved, withdrawal 8-10ml from each patient into a tube containg either 3,8 % sodium citrate and either enoxaparin gel or thixotropic cell-separation gel. The tubes were centrifuged at either 3900 rpm for 10 minutes or at 1500g for 5 minutes, resulting in four layers: a cell-rich layer at the bottom of the tube covered by the separating gel, a PRP layer on top of the gel, and a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) layer at the top. The tube was gently agitated in order to mix the PPP with the PRP. The solution, cca 4-5ml, was withdrawn with a needle and injected to the scalp-frontoparietal region using either a syringe and a 4mm needle or an injector. According to the protocol of our hospital, the injections to the scalp were spaced 0.5-1cm apart.&#xD;
PRP was applied once every month for 3 months. Macroscopic and digital phototrichographic photos were taken before the beginning of treatment, 1 month after the last injection, and 3 months after the end of treatmert.</description>

    <description>For mesotherapy, usually around 5ml of saline solution was withdrawn using a needle and released to the selected ampule containing adipose tissue stem-cell conditioned media and mixture of recombinant growth factors, in a powder form. We used preparations from two different companies, differing in the combination and concentration of ingredients. After the injection of normal saline, the ampule was gently agitated in order to disperse the powder and injected to the scalp-frontoparietal region using either a syringe and a 4mm needle or a gun injector. The injections were spaced 0.5-1cm apart.&#xD;
Mesotherapy was repeated every 1-2 weeks for 6-7 times according to the protocol recommended for each preparation. Macroscopic and phototrichographic photos were taken before the beginning of treatment, a month after the last injection and 3 months after the end of treatment.</description>
