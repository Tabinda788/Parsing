      LA rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP -02-PED is a Phase 1/2, randomized, controlled open label trial. The LA&#xD;
      rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP -02-PED trial aims primarily to assess the clinical significance of shedding&#xD;
      of the rVSV RNA following vaccination with the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in children. The&#xD;
      vaccine doses of ≥7.8 x 107 pfu will be evaluated and compared to vaccination with varicella&#xD;
      vaccine as a control. In addition, the closest contact persons of the vaccinees will be&#xD;
      monitored for possible transmission of the viral vaccine vector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll children of two age groups living in Lambaréné, Gabon. Children will be&#xD;
      followed-up for 12 months post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1-2 closest contact persons of each participant will be involved in the monitoring of&#xD;
      rVSV transmission. They will be followed until day 56 post- vaccination of their children/&#xD;
      sibling.&#xD;

      LA-rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP -02-PED is a Phase 1/2, randomized, controlled, open label, trial and is&#xD;
      designed to generate further safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data of the 7.8 x 107&#xD;
      PFU rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in children aged 1 -12 years living in a sub-Saharan Africa. The&#xD;
      study will enroll participants into two age groups. A total of 120 children will be enrolled&#xD;
      and followed-up for 12 months post injection. In addition, a maximum of 240 relatives of the&#xD;
      study participants will be enrolled to assess the transmission of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 60 participants aged 6-12 years will be randomized in group 1. 40 participants will&#xD;
      receive a single intramuscular dose of 7.8 x 107 pfu rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine. 20 participants&#xD;
      will receive a single subcutaneous dose of varicella vaccine The participants will be&#xD;
      allocated to each treatment at a ratio of 2:1 respectively Group 2: 60 participants aged 1 -5&#xD;
      years will be randomized into group 2. 40 will receive a single intramuscular dose of 7.8 x&#xD;
      107 pfu of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. 20 participants will receive a single subcutaneous dose of&#xD;
      varicella vaccine The participants will be allocated to each treatment at a ratio of 2:1&#xD;
      respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinations will start in group 2 after the first 10 participants of group 1 have completed&#xD;
      the day 28 post vaccination visit and the SMC has done a review of safety data until that&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each vaccinee there will be a 365 -day period of follow-up after vaccination. The contact&#xD;
      persons of the vaccinees will be followed-up until day 56 after the vaccination of their&#xD;
      relative.&#xD;
