    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a multi-system progressive disorder characterized by the new onset of&#xD;
      hypertension and proteinuria, or hypertension and significant end-organ dysfunction with or&#xD;
      without proteinuria, in the last half of pregnancy or postpartum. The genesis of the disease&#xD;
      is laid down in early pregnancy and is characterized anatomically by abnormal remodeling of&#xD;
      the maternal spiral arteries at the placental site.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eclampsia was firstly reported in 2200 BC in papyri of ancient Egypt. Eclampsia is originally&#xD;
      a Greek word ´eklampsis and means &quot;bright light&quot;. For 2000 years, eclampsia was known as a&#xD;
      disease of convulsions in late gestation that resolves by childbirth. Scientists of late 19th&#xD;
      century recognized the similarity in the swollen appearance of pregnant women who had&#xD;
      seizures and explained all by the onset of glomerulonephritis with proteinuria. With the&#xD;
      advanced noninvasive blood pressure measurement, it was observed that those women had&#xD;
      increased blood pressure and not a long time before understanding that proteinuria and&#xD;
      arterial hypertension occurrence before seizures. Thus, it was defined as &quot;pre-eclampsia&quot;&#xD;
      that now it is a life-threatening condition for both the mother and the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, with an incidence that varies according to&#xD;
      different measures, can exceed 10% in some population. Between multiple causes of maternal&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are the second or third. [2]&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study made by WHO between 2003 and 2009 ranked hypertensive disorders as a cause of&#xD;
      maternal deaths in the second grade, occurring in 14% of the cases, and in the first grade&#xD;
      was hemorrhagic causes, responsible for 27.1%. [3] The 20th week of gestation is a period of&#xD;
      interest as it is the landmark in the classification of hypertensive disorders because it is&#xD;
      the time of the second wave of chorionic invasion. Thus hypertensive disorders were&#xD;
      classified into two groups. The first one is before 20 weeks of gestation and includes&#xD;
      essential chronic or secondary hypertension, white coat hypertension, &quot;Masked&quot; hypertension.&#xD;
      The second group which appears at or after 20 weeks of gestation includes transient&#xD;
      gestational hypertension, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) replaced the term&#xD;
      &quot;severe pre-eclampsia&quot; with the term &quot;preeclampsia with severe features&quot; which means systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg on at least 2 occasions, at&#xD;
      least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive patient (with or&#xD;
      without proteinuria) and the new onset of 1 or more of the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Symptoms: Epigastric pain, hypochondrial pain, Cerebral or visual symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
      new-onset and persistent headaches not accounted for by alternative diagnoses and not&#xD;
      responding to usual doses of analgesics, blurred vision, flashing lights or sparks,&#xD;
      scotomata).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Signs: Pulmonary edema and/or generalized edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Laboratory findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proteinuria ≥ 0.3 gm in a 24-hour urine specimen or protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3&#xD;
           (mg/mg) (30 mg/m.mol) in a random urine specimen or dipstick ≥2+ if a quantitative&#xD;
           measurement is unavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet count &lt;100,000/µL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.1 mg/d L (97.2 µmol/L) or doubling of the creatinine concentration&#xD;
           in the absence of another renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver transaminases are at least twice the upper limit of the normal concentrations for&#xD;
           the local laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to older criteria, the 2013 criteria severity features do not include proteinuria&#xD;
      &gt;5 g/24 hours and fetal growth restriction as features of severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So non-severe pre-eclampsia means that systolic BP from 130 to less than 160 mmHg, diastolic&#xD;
      BP from 80 to less than 110 mmHg, and Proteinuria ≥ 0.3 gm in a 24-hour urine specimen or&#xD;
      protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3 (mg/mg) (30 mg/m.mol) in a random urine specimen or dipstick&#xD;
      ≥2+ if a quantitative measurement is unavailable without the presence of the above-mentioned&#xD;
      severity features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a woman with chronic/preexisting hypertension, criteria for superimposed preeclampsia are&#xD;
      the new onset of proteinuria, significant end-organ dysfunction, or both after 20 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation. For women with chronic/preexisting hypertension who have proteinuria prior to or&#xD;
      in early pregnancy, superimposed preeclampsia is defined by worsening or resistant&#xD;
      hypertension (especially acutely) in the last half of pregnancy or development of signs or&#xD;
      symptoms of the severe end of the disease spectrum.&#xD;
