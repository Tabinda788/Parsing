  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one-third of older adults report one or more falls each year, with devastating&#xD;
      physical, psychological, social, and financial consequences. Conventional gait analysis&#xD;
      performed in a controlled laboratory environment can identify balance deficits, but&#xD;
      unfortunately, such tools are bulky, time-consuming, and dependent on qualified technicians&#xD;
      to properly collect and evaluate the data. Furthermore, these one-time gait and balance&#xD;
      assessments cannot monitor changes in ambulatory strategies longitudinally and do not reflect&#xD;
      performance in real-life environments, where falls commonly occur. While recent developments&#xD;
      in smartphone-based evaluations have demonstrated great utility and accuracy in assessing&#xD;
      gait performance, it is vital to evaluate participant compliance, ease-of-use, and&#xD;
      feasibility of this technology using a smartphone in the home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also paramount that interventions which improve balance be accessible to older adults.&#xD;
      While four-week balance training routines have been shown to improve balance performance&#xD;
      among older adults, it is unknown whether such interventions can be conducted remotely in a&#xD;
      safe and compliant manner. Furthermore, the retention of balance function following&#xD;
      intervention is unclear. Subsequently, the goals of this study are to evaluate technology&#xD;
      that can both remotely monitor balance and prescribe intervention to older adults. With the&#xD;
      current burdens on the health care system and the burgeoning population of older adults, it&#xD;
      is essential that tools be provided to older adults that are easy to follow, attractive, and&#xD;
      improve balance performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this project is to investigate the utility of a valid, easily&#xD;
      accessible, smartphone application to assess balance and provide personalized exercise for&#xD;
      older adults as a stand-alone, field-based medical device. The aims of this proposal are to&#xD;
      (1) utilize a smartphone application to longitudinally evaluate gait and standing balance&#xD;
      over an 8-week period in the home environment among 30 healthy older adults and 30 older&#xD;
      adults with a history of falls; and (2) determine the feasibility and efficacy of a&#xD;
      smartphone application to promote exercise and evaluate gait changes for up to 2 months in&#xD;
      this older adult population following a 4-week balance intervention. The long-term goal of&#xD;
      this project is to provide a holistic home-based gait monitoring and intervention tool for&#xD;
      integration in routine clinical care.&#xD;
