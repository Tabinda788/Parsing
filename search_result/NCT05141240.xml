      This is a retrospective cohort study to assess the real-world analysis of concomitant&#xD;
      medication use among metastatic breast cancer patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing the US Optum research administrative claims&#xD;
      database. Adult female patients who had HR+/HER2- mBC were identified and included in the&#xD;
      study. These patients were stratified into three cohorts based on the first CDK4/6i received&#xD;
      (ribociclib, palbociclib, or abemaciclib).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study period: Period during which all relevant medical and pharmacy information in the&#xD;
           database was retrieved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Index event identification period: time frame during which index treatment was&#xD;
           identified&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First CDK4/6i: the date on which patients initiated their first treatment after being&#xD;
           diagnosed with HR+/HER2- mBC; this date was considered as the index date&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline period: Time frame during which patient characteristics, prior mBC treatments,&#xD;
           and concomitant treatments received by CDK4/6i-naïve patients were evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up period: time frame on and after the index date during which patients'&#xD;
           treatments and dosing patterns were observed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishment of baseline period Health plan enrollment in the three months prior to the&#xD;
      index treatment was included in the baseline period. Patient demographics, clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, National Cancer Institute (NCI) comorbidity index, concomitant medication&#xD;
      use that can potentially lead to a DDI, and other BC treatments prior to the index treatment&#xD;
      were evaluated during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishment of follow-up period Patients were observed for ≥3 months starting from the&#xD;
      index date until the end of the study period or continuous enrollment or until the time when&#xD;
      patients switched to another therapy (including another CDK4/6i), whichever came first.&#xD;
      Dosing patterns for CDK4/6i were evaluated in the follow-up period. Analyses were conducted&#xD;
      at key time points of 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
