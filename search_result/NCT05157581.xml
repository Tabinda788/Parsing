  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint is to determine if ECP induces a decrease in % of tumor cells after&#xD;
      treatment. 15 patients with Sezary Syndrome will receive ECP weekly x4, then bi-weekly for 5&#xD;
      months. Each patient will donate 5 samples to determine immune responses in peripheral blood.&#xD;
      Additional clinical assessments will be a modified skin weighted assessment and flow&#xD;
      cytometry at baseline and months 3 and 6. A CT scan will be obtained at baseline and only&#xD;
      repeated if pathology is present at baseline. The tumor microenvironment will be studied by&#xD;
      comparing transcriptomics of the blood samples before, 1 day after first ECP treatment, cycle&#xD;
      1, 1, 3 and 6 months after ECP treatment by scRNAseq (5 samples total per patient ).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a group of skin lymphomas in which malignant lymphocytes&#xD;
      infiltrate the skin and, in the later stages, spread to the lymph nodes and blood (leukemia).&#xD;
      In the early stages, CTCL generally has a slow course, but in advanced diseases, such as&#xD;
      Sezary syndrome (the leukemic form of the disease), there is rapid deterioration. Sezary&#xD;
      syndrome is an end-stage variant of CTCL with a mean survival of 1.5 years despite aggressive&#xD;
      therapies. Treatment options for the advanced disease are severely limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, informed consent will be offered to patients who are candidates for standard&#xD;
      of care ECP and have a diagnosis of Sezary Syndrome. Participating patients will undergo ECP&#xD;
      twice weekly for 4 weeks then twice monthly for 5 more months (month 6 of therapy). Research&#xD;
      blood samples to assess immune responses will be obtained from a blood draw at baseline&#xD;
      (before starting ECP), one day after first ECP, and at months 1, 3, and 6. Standard of care&#xD;
      assessments to determine the objective response will include measurement of skin tumor burden&#xD;
      (mSWAT), blood tumor burden (flow cytometry) and CT scan at baseline and only repeated at&#xD;
      month 3 and 6 if lymph node or visceral (organ) involvement identified at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IWe propose to establish changes in the tumor microenvironment after ECP, compare&#xD;
      transcriptomic differences in malignant lymphocytes, monocytes, DC, and CD8 effectors before&#xD;
      and after ECP to test the hypothesis that anti-tumor immune responses can be induced by ECP.&#xD;
      We will employ a highly innovative technology such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)&#xD;
      coupled with TCR sequencing to characterize ECP-related change in malignant cells utilizing a&#xD;
      custom gene set and validate the single-cell protein data by antibody-oligo conjugates. To&#xD;
      better understand the relevance of biomarker changes to disease progression, the observed&#xD;
      ECP-related changes in tumor microenvironment will be correlated with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
