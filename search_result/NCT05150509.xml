    <textblock>
      Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common oral malignancy worldwide. The&#xD;
      prognosis of the OSCC patient is not significant despite the modern treatment facilities.&#xD;
      Late presentation is one of the most crucial cause of this and for that reason, the&#xD;
      importance of early diagnosis of OSCC should be the main concern. Till now, incisional biopsy&#xD;
      followed by histopathological examination is the gold standard for diagnosis of oral cancer.&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to find out the association of salivary amino acid levels&#xD;
      with oral squamous cell carcinoma, whether the levels are increased or decreased in the&#xD;
      patient suffering from OSCC. This might be helpful for early diagnosis of oral cancer and&#xD;
      better prognosis.&#xD;

      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oral cancer is an abnormal growth of tissue, originates from the tissue in and around&#xD;
           the mouth which is uncoordinated with that of the surrounding normal tissue. Among all&#xD;
           oral cancers, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common (90%) malignant&#xD;
           epithelial neoplasm of the oral cavity. It is an alarming public health problem in the&#xD;
           world due to its prevalence, high incidence rate and mortality. According to the recent&#xD;
           data of GLOBOCAN 2020, 377713 newly diagnosed lip and oral cavity squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma patients diagnosed worldwide which is about 2% of all cancer reported. Oral&#xD;
           squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the 6th most common cancer worldwide. Recent global&#xD;
           reports suggest that the largest portion of the reported cases are from Asia (65.8%),&#xD;
           but in the South Asia region, oral cancer is the 3rd most common cancer. One of the&#xD;
           critical factor of the high mortality rate of OSCC is that initially many of the lesion&#xD;
           is asymptomatic. As a result, they come at the late stage of the disease to the&#xD;
           physician and ultimately have a poor prognosis. Research showed that, when an OSCC is in&#xD;
           stage I, the 5-year survival rate is 80% but it drops to 20-40% when the disease is in&#xD;
           stage IV. For the diagnosis of OSCC, after the initial clinical examination, incisional&#xD;
           biopsy followed by histopathological examination is still considered as a gold standard,&#xD;
           but the method has many limitations. Invasive procedure needs special expertise for&#xD;
           taking biopsy sample from the representative areas and need expert histopathologist for&#xD;
           confirmation. Moreover, taking a tissue sample from behind the visible area such as the&#xD;
           base of the tongue, posterior pillar and incase of restricted jaw opening is very&#xD;
           difficult or sometimes impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Human saliva is the secretion from three major salivary gland parotid, submandibular,&#xD;
           sublingual and numerous minor glands lie just beneath the mucosa of the oral cavity. It&#xD;
           consists of water (99.5%), inorganic salts and enzymes (0.2%) and proteins (0.3%). It is&#xD;
           helpful for the diagnosis of periodontitis, diabetes mellitus, HIV, dengue, mumps even&#xD;
           breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and oral cancer.&#xD;
           Additionally, taking saliva samples has many advantages. Taking saliva is easier, and&#xD;
           needs no invasive procedure or expertise. Besides, it has a sufficient amount of&#xD;
           production and can be taken by the patient himself making the sample taking procedure&#xD;
           cheaper. Salivary amino acids are the important metabolites for the diagnosis of a&#xD;
           cancer patient. Amino acid is the raw product of protein synthesis. For this, when a&#xD;
           cancer patient passes through a hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic state, there is a&#xD;
           chance of protein imbalance. As we know that amino acids are the byproducts of protein,&#xD;
           it can give us a hint for the state of imbalance due to any cancer including oral&#xD;
           squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, changes in amino acid concentration in the body&#xD;
           fluid of cancer patient is significant according to several studies Mass spectrometry is&#xD;
           a currently used platform for proteomics or metabolomics in biomedical research. Like&#xD;
           other spectrometry method such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS),&#xD;
           capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry(CE-MS), two-dimensional electrophoresis mass&#xD;
           spectrometry (2DE-MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass&#xD;
           spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight&#xD;
           mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF), Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is widely&#xD;
           used nowadays. It allows a quick and efficient separation and characterization of&#xD;
           analytes in a given sample. Thus, it can help in rapid diagnosis of any disease by&#xD;
           automated analysis of amino acid profiles with minimum effort and expenses. Many studies&#xD;
           were conducted using LC-MS machine for saliva analysis for the diagnosis of several&#xD;
           diseases and found significant results. To the best of my knowledge, very few studies&#xD;
           were done to find out the salivary amino acid level from the patient having suspected&#xD;
           oral lesion by LC-MS. Moreover, no study was performed for oral lesion diagnosis by&#xD;
           analysis of amino acid profile using LC-MS in Bangladesh. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
           find out the association of specific salivary amino acid levels with the patient of OSCC&#xD;
           by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           OSCC is the 6th most common cancer worldwide, but in Asia the largest portion was&#xD;
           reported recently and in South-east Asia, it is the 3rd most common cancer. Poor&#xD;
           socio-economic condition, lack of consciousness and widely use of tobacco, betel quid&#xD;
           chewing and alcohol intake are the main factors behind this. Research showed that early&#xD;
           diagnosis of cancer reduces the mortality rate and hence can improve the treatment&#xD;
           outcome. As a result, scientists are trying to find out an easy, quick and reliable&#xD;
           method of diagnosis of OSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although scalpel (incisional) biopsy followed by histopathological examination is still&#xD;
           the gold standard for the diagnosis of the oral lesion but in the case of behind the&#xD;
           visible area and in restricted mouth opening it is very difficult to collect the&#xD;
           representative specimen. Moreover, the procedure is invasive and needs special equipment&#xD;
           and expertise. In this aspect, to avoid the risk of invasive procedures and pain, body&#xD;
           fluid analysis is the area of interest of the researcher nowadays.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Among the other body fluid, saliva is very easy to collect, non-invasive and might have&#xD;
           the property to diagnose of OSCC because it remains with the contact with the lesion. It&#xD;
           has plenty of flow and less costly than the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
           LC-MS machine is now widely used for metabolomics analysis all over the world. It has&#xD;
           the capacity to analyze a sample more effectively and within a very short time.&#xD;
           Measuring the amino acid and other components from the saliva can easily be done by this&#xD;
           method. Due to some diseases, amino acid concentration of body fluid differs according&#xD;
           to several studies. We believe that for the Bangladeshi population there are significant&#xD;
           associations between several salivary amino acid levels and OSCC, which can be&#xD;
           identified by LC-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To find out the association of salivary amino acid levels with oral squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma (OSCC) identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.&#xD;

       10. Aim and Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to find out the association of salivary amino acid levels with oral&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).The study will be conducted at Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery&#xD;
      Department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Patient with histologically&#xD;
      confirmed OSCC will be enrolled as cases in the study by purposive convenient sampling&#xD;
      technique to achieve the desired number. Approximately same number of the healthy individuals&#xD;
      will be taken as control group for comparison. Then the saliva will be taken from the OSCC&#xD;
      patient and from the control group. After taking in the sterile container and ensuring proper&#xD;
      environment saliva sample will be carried to Designated Reference Institute for Chemical&#xD;
      Measurements (DRICM), Science lab, Dhanmondi for analysis by liquid chromatography-mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS) machine. By this machine, the levels of 6 specific amino acids (Alanine,&#xD;
      Valine, Glycine, Phenylalanine, Isoleucine, Lysine) will be measured. The data obtained from&#xD;
      each individual will be recorded in predesigned data collection sheet separately. If you are&#xD;
      agreeing to participate in this research program, the responsible doctor will inform you in&#xD;
