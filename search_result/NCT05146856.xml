  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal, investigators seek to address conclusively two knowledge gaps: 1) the lack&#xD;
      of data on the impact of a schedule including a day off clinic before night shift on&#xD;
      performances of residents in anesthesia or critical care medicine and 2) the lack of data on&#xD;
      the relationship between resident sleep deprivation and their non technical skills&#xD;
      impairment. Investigators designed a prospective, randomized, blinded in cross over&#xD;
      evaluation of medical pratices. Investigators will compare resident's performance during a&#xD;
      high fidelity simulation session, on crisis managment in intensive care unit, after a night&#xD;
      shift in intensive care unit, of residents who work on an intervention schedule with no&#xD;
      clinical activity before night shift, with resident's performance of residents who had a&#xD;
      traditionnal schedule including an usual clinical day before night shift. Investigators also&#xD;
      assess cognitive performances, sleepiness and self esteem before and after night shift.&#xD;
      Investigators specific aims will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that residents working on an intervention schedule will have non&#xD;
      technical skills, assessed by Ottawa GRS global score, significantly less impaired after a&#xD;
      night shift, than those on traditionnal schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that residents working on an interveniton schedule will have cognitive&#xD;
      performances, sleepiness and self esteem less impaired after night shift than those on a&#xD;
      traditionnal schedule&#xD;

      Main objective of this study is to compare the non-technical skills after night shift, of&#xD;
      anaesthesia and critical care residents who did not have clinical activity before the night&#xD;
      shift with those who had at least 8 hours of clinical activity before. The workforce is&#xD;
      constrained by the number of residents in training at Clermont-Ferrand and Lyon University&#xD;
      Public Hospital. Thus, it is possible to consider the inclusion of 60 residents for 55&#xD;
      evaluable. With such numbers, the clinically relevant difference of 6 points for the Ottawa&#xD;
      GRS score (for a standard deviation of 11) can be demonstrated with an alpha risk of&#xD;
      bilateral error of 5% and a power of 80%. Two interim analyzes will be carried out including&#xD;
      the first 20 interns and then 20 additional interns (therefore for 40 interns) with the aim&#xD;
      of stopping the study for &quot;effectiveness&quot;, more precisely stopping the study for evidence of&#xD;
      a statistically significant difference for the primary outcome measure, with risks of first&#xD;
      error observed respectively at 0.0005 and 0.014 comparisons (correction due to multiples). A&#xD;
      simulation of the statistical power will also be proposed during the performance of these&#xD;
      analyzes; if necessary, a new estimation of the workforce will be proposed to the competent&#xD;
      authorities. Investigators do not plan loss of follow up.&#xD;
