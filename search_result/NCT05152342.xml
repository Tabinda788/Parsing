  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stigma is one of the most pervasive barriers to addiction care in the U.S. criminal justice&#xD;
      (CJ) system. However, there have been no stigma reduction interventions developed for this&#xD;
      context. This project addresses this gap with a new multi-level stigma intervention,&#xD;
      Combatting Stigma to Aid Reentry and Recovery (CSTARR), for justice-involved people with&#xD;
      addiction and criminal justice staff. This intervention will be implemented in 6 (mostly&#xD;
      rural) counties in TN for clients and staff in the Tennessee Recovery Oriented Compliance&#xD;
      Strategy (TN-ROCS) program, which coordinates multiple CJ sectors (i.e., courts, corrections,&#xD;
      probation, treatment) to divert and treat people with addiction. This project aims to 1)&#xD;
      examine the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation considerations of integrating&#xD;
      CSTARR in the TN-ROCS program, and 2) determine whether CSTARR impacts individual, staff, and&#xD;
      program-level outcomes. We aim to recruit 25 stakeholders, 80 clients, and 75 staff over the&#xD;
      course of this 18-month project to participate in our intervention and evaluation efforts.&#xD;
      Staff and clients will be asked to complete online surveys before and after the intervention,&#xD;
      as well as 1- and 3-month follow ups, for which they will receive gift-cards. The overall&#xD;
      goal of this project is to examine the feasibility and utility of stigma reduction efforts in&#xD;
      the criminal justice system to determine whether they can help facilitate engagement with&#xD;
      evidence-based addiction care and improve client and staff outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stigma is one of the most pervasive barriers to addiction care in the U.S. criminal justice&#xD;
      (CJ) system. Stigmatizing attitudes about addiction, its intersecting conditions (i.e.,&#xD;
      criminal involvement), and its treatment (i.e., medications for opioid use disorder [MOUD])&#xD;
      are widespread throughout court, corrections, probation, and treatment sectors. These&#xD;
      attitudes impact treatment decisions as well as how staff interact with clients. CJ-involved&#xD;
      individuals with addiction are aware of this stigma, perceiving negative stereotypes,&#xD;
      expecting to be judged, and often feeling ashamed and worthless as a result (i.e.,&#xD;
      self-stigma). Self-stigma is a robust predictor of treatment avoidance, non-compliance, and&#xD;
      dropout in many stigmatized groups, including people with addiction and CJ involvement,&#xD;
      making this a critical treatment barrier. Despite the negative consequences of stigma in the&#xD;
      CJ system, there are virtually no stigma reduction interventions in this context. Given that&#xD;
      the CJ system provides a substantial portion of addiction treatment, and untreated addiction&#xD;
      increases risk for relapse, re-arrest, overdose, and other negative outcomes, it is essential&#xD;
      to address stigma-related barriers to addiction care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We drew from existing evidence-based interventions to develop a multi-level stigma&#xD;
      intervention, Combatting Stigma to Aid Re-entry and Recovery (CSTARR), that simultaneously&#xD;
      targets CJ staff attitudes as well as CJ-involved individuals' ability to cope with stigma in&#xD;
      separate client and staff interventions. The staff intervention involves a half-day Stigma&#xD;
      Awareness Training, and the client intervention involves a three-session Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy for self-stigma group that was adapted to address criminal involvement in&#xD;
      addition to addiction stigma. We will deliver both interventions virtually in 6 (primarily&#xD;
      rural) Tennessee counties that contain infrastructure called the Tennessee Recovery Oriented&#xD;
      Compliance Strategy (TN-ROCS). TN-ROCS coordinates multiple CJ sectors (i.e., courts,&#xD;
      corrections, probation, treatment) to divert and treat people with addiction, thus presenting&#xD;
      a unique unified system to intervene with stigma at both client and staff levels. Also,&#xD;
      select TN-ROCS counties are integrating MOUD services, providing an opportunity to reduce&#xD;
      stigma that may ultimately impact MOUD engagement. This project aims to 1) examine the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and implementation considerations of integrating CSTARR in the&#xD;
      TN-ROCS program, and 2) determine whether CSTARR impacts individual, staff, and program-level&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit 25 stakeholders, 80 clients, and 75 staff over the course of this 18-month&#xD;
      project to participate in our intervention and evaluation efforts. Staff and clients will be&#xD;
      asked to complete online surveys before and after the intervention, as well as 1- and 3-month&#xD;
      follow ups, for which they will receive gift-cards. The overall goal of this project is to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and utility of stigma reduction efforts in the criminal justice&#xD;
      system to determine whether they can help facilitate engagement with evidence-based addiction&#xD;
      care and improve client and staff outcomes.&#xD;
