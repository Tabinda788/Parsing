    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Islatravir&#xD;
      (ISL) in trans and gender diverse (TGD) participants who are receiving gender-affirming&#xD;
      hormone therapy (GAHT) and are at low-risk for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is confirmed HIV-uninfected based on negative HIV-1/HIV-2 test result before&#xD;
             allocation to study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is on stable GAHT and does not intend to change therapy through Week 4 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a low-risk of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identifies with a gender that is different from that assigned at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A participant assigned female at birth is eligible if not pregnant or chest-feeding&#xD;
             and is not of childbearing potential (POCBP) or: Is a POCBP and using an acceptable&#xD;
             contraceptive method, or be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse with an&#xD;
             individual capable of producing sperm (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis);&#xD;
             a POCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test ([urine or serum] as&#xD;
             required by local regulations) within 24 hours before the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention; If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g, an ambiguous&#xD;
             result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be&#xD;
             excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive; the&#xD;
             investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and&#xD;
             recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a participant assigned&#xD;
             female at birth with an early undetected pregnancy; contraceptive use by participant&#xD;
             assigned female at birth should be consistent with local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known current or chronic history of liver disease (e.g, non-alcoholic or alcoholic&#xD;
             steatohepatitis) or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of&#xD;
             Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, or cholecystectomy), unless the&#xD;
             participant has stable liver function tests and no evidence of hepatic synthetic&#xD;
             dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of malignancy within 5 years of screening except for adequately treated&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or in situ anal&#xD;
             cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has taken cabotegravir, lenacapavir, or any other long-acting HIV prevention product&#xD;
             at any time (past or current use).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a clinical study with an&#xD;
             investigational compound or device, within 30 days before Day 1 through the duration&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is expecting to conceive or donate eggs at any time during the study.&#xD;
