      This Phase 1 dose-finding study investigates the maximal tolerated dose for a subsequent&#xD;
      phase 2 trial testing MR-guided individualized response-adaptive dose prescription in HNC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, non-randomized interventional dose-finding phase I trial evaluates the&#xD;
      maximal tolerated boost dose with respect to dose limiting toxicities in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (UICC stage III/IVB) with an&#xD;
      indication for a primary radiochemotherapy. The primary aim of the trial is to define the&#xD;
      maximal tolerated dose in an ADC-based subvolume using an adaptive SBRT-boost areal.&#xD;
      Dose-escalated SBRT boost to ADC-high risk volume will be delivered once a week and is&#xD;
      defined according to the the actual imaging immediately performed prior to delivery&#xD;
      (real-time adaptive) i.e. it can vary from one week to another and it might also be reduced&#xD;
      throughout the course of treatment (response adaptive). In case of complete disappearance of&#xD;
      high-risk subvolumes sufficient large enough to boost (&lt;5ml), no further ADC boost but only&#xD;
      the floor-boost dose is given. The dose escalation of the ADC-high risk volume boost is&#xD;
      graduated in four dose levels of 5x5 Gy, 5x5.5 Gy, 5x6 Gy, 5x6.5 Gy in a classical 3+3&#xD;
      dose-finding design where 3 patients per radiation dose level are enrolled. Primary endpoint&#xD;
      is the dose limiting toxicity, any acute and late non-hematologic grade 4 or 5 related to the&#xD;
      radiotherapy intervention, ≥ grade 3 CTC v.5. oral mucositis at 3 months after radiotherapy.&#xD;
