  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter,&#xD;
      outpatient study in subjects with schizophrenia with an inadequate response to their current&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotic treatment. The primary objective of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of adjunctive KarXT (a fixed dose combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride&#xD;
      twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in the treatment of subjects with inadequately controlled&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)&#xD;
      Total Score. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive&#xD;
      KarXT compared with placebo on the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP), improvement&#xD;
      in disease severity and symptoms, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. Participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The total score is the sum of all scales with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Personal Social Performance (PSP) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale assesses functioning using a structured clinical interview across four dimensions: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. The PSP provides a score between 1 and 100 using a 6-point severity scale</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S modified asked the clinician 1 question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; The clinician's answer rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Marder Positive symptom factor score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive Marder Factor score is derived from the PANSS and consists of the sum of 4 positive symptom items (P), one negative symptom item (N) and 3 general symptom items (G) (P1. Delusions; P3. Hallucinations; P5. Grandiosity; P6. Suspiciousness and persecution; N7. Stereotyped thinking; G1. Somatic concern; G9. Unusual thought content; G12. Lack of judgment and insight).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Marder Negative symptom factor score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Negative Marder Factor score is derived from the PANSS and consists of the sum of 5 negative symptom items (N) and 2 general symptom items (G) (N1. Blunted affect; N2. Emotional withdrawal; N3. Poor rapport; N4. Passive/apathetic social withdrawal; N6. Lack of spontaneity; G7. Motor retardation; and G16. Active social avoidance), with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preference of Medication (POM) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The POM is a two-item questionnaire assessing the patient's and informant's preference, respectively, for the current antipsychotic as compared with the most recent pre-study antipsychotic. The POM is scored on the following scale: 1 = 'much better, I prefer this medication,' 2 = 'slightly better,' 3 = 'about the same,' 4 = 'slightly worse,' and 5 = 'much worse, I much prefer my previous medication.'</description>
