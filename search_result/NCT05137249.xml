  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The damage of the endothelial glycocalyx is based on microvascular endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      and typical for critical clinical conditions like sepsis, trauma, bleeding, shock, as well as&#xD;
      ARDS. We aim to generate first hints regarding the impact of covid-19 disease on the (damage)&#xD;
      of the endothelial glycocalyx. Furthermore, we want to investigate the potential&#xD;
      coagulopathies, which go along with shedding of the glycocalyx. The detection of and the&#xD;
      relation between the severity of the disease, as well as the extent of the glycocalyx damage&#xD;
      during the observational period, as well as the hemostatic alterations, are aim of the study.&#xD;
