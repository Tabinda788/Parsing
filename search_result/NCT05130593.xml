  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to make a bar from the soy-protein Russian Tarragon (5011)&#xD;
      complex (5011-Nutrasorb) that is safe and acceptable for consumption, and to test the blood&#xD;
      levels of 5011-Nutrasorb that is contained in the bar. The 5011-Nutrasorb comes from a plant&#xD;
      source called Artemisia drancunculus. This plant has a long history of medicinal (health) and&#xD;
      culinary (food) use and has been reported as effective as a traditional treatment for&#xD;
      diabetes in various parts of the world.&#xD;

      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Day: Fasting Visit (nothing to eat or drink other than water beginning at 10 pm the&#xD;
      night before the test day); visit will be approximately 1 ½ hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be done on the Test Day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be signed by those agreeing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight and height will be measured (body mass index will be calculated from these&#xD;
           measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a list of any medications they are currently taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and pulse will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taste test of the study bar will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions regarding the taste, smell, appearance, texture, and&#xD;
           pleasantness of the bar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 participants may be asked to return up to two additional times to complete the taste&#xD;
      test and questions again. This will occur if the product is found unacceptable and will be&#xD;
      completed after a new bar is produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: Fasting Visit (nothing to eat or drink other than water after 10 pm the&#xD;
      night before the Screening Visit); visit will be approximately 1 ½ hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be done on the Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be signed by those agreeing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight and height will be measured (body mass index will be calculated from these&#xD;
           measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and pulse will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history questionnaire will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn (approximately 2 teaspoons) to assess overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Day: Fasting visit (nothing to eat or drink other than water after 10 pm the night&#xD;
      before the Test Day); visit will be approximately 4 hours and will be completed within 30&#xD;
      days after Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be done on the Test Day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn from an IV line placed in the participant's arm to assess the level&#xD;
           of nutrients, blood sugar levels, and insulin levels from the study bar 10 minutes&#xD;
           before the bar is consumed, immediately after the bar is consumed, and 30, 60, 120, and&#xD;
           180 minutes after the bar is consumed. A total of approximately 6 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
           will be drawn for this Test Day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taste test of the study bar will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions regarding the taste, smell, appearance, texture, and&#xD;
           pleasantness of the bar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked about any side effects and how they feel throughout the Test&#xD;
           Day.&#xD;
