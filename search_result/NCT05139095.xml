      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab and apatinib&#xD;
      as combination therapy in patients with ultra high-risk and high-risk chemo-refractory or&#xD;
      relapsed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia（GTN）. Treatment was continued until progressive&#xD;
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Patients would receive 6 cycles of&#xD;
      consolidation therapy if achieving a complete response.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab and apatinib&#xD;
      as combination therapy in patients with ultra high-risk and high-risk chemo-refractory or&#xD;
      relapsed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia（GTN）. Treatment was continued until progressive&#xD;
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Patients would receive 6 cycles of&#xD;
      consolidation therapy if achieving a complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was objective response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      complete or partial response according to serum hCG level. Secondary endpoints were duration&#xD;
      of response (time from the first evidence of response to disease progression or death,&#xD;
      whichever came first), progression-free survival (time from the treatment initiation to&#xD;
      disease progression according to serum hCG level or death, whichever came first), overall&#xD;
      survival (time from the treatment initiation to the date of death or end of follow-up), and&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
