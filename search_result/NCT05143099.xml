    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirelizumab&#xD;
      combined with cetuximab + irinotecan in the treatment of Ras wild-type recurrent and&#xD;
      refractory colorectal cancer. This study will include Ras wild-type colorectal cancer that&#xD;
      failed at least second-line treatment in the past, including chemotherapy (oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      irinotecan, fluorouracil) with or without targeted drugs (cetuximab, bevacizumab). 33&#xD;
      patients were planned to be treated with tirelizumab combined with cetuximab + irinotecan&#xD;
      every 2 weeks. The enrollment time is expected to be 12 months and the follow-up is 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
