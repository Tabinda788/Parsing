  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TNF-α inhibitors, like Adalimumab, have good efficacy in non-infectious uveitis, but&#xD;
      long-term use can increase the risk of drugs, and the patient's financial burden is large.&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to explore the reduction or withdrawal of Adalimumab in&#xD;
      uveitis patients with stable drug control, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drug&#xD;
      reduction in uveitis patients, as well as the impact on their vision prognosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      TNF-α inhibitors, like Adalimumab, have good efficacy in non-infectious uveitis, but&#xD;
      long-term use will increase the risk of drugs, and the patient's financial burden is large.&#xD;
      Previous studies have reported that tapering or discontinuation of Adalimumab may be&#xD;
      considered in patients with stable disease. In clinical practice, some important questions&#xD;
      about the feasibility of dose reduction in individual patients and the withdrawal plan remain&#xD;
      unanswered. The objective of this study was to explore the reduction or withdrawal of&#xD;
      Adalimumab in uveitis patients with stable drug control, and to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of drug reduction in uveitis patients, as well as the impact on their vision&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
