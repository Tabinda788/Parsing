      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) specific antibody and&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody level induced by adenovirus vector vaccines were lower than mRNA&#xD;
      vaccines. Vaccine efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was lower than BNT162b2 and mRNA 1273 in&#xD;
      clinical trials. The emergence of highly transmissible and mutant variants of SARS-COV-2 has&#xD;
      raised the concern of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. The complete vaccination rate is still&#xD;
      low in Taiwan. Strict border control measures are imposed by Central Epidemic Command Center.&#xD;
      However, the measure of quarantine for flight crew is considered one of the breach of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection control. Despite most of the flight crew has fully vaccinated, several&#xD;
      episodes of breakthrough infection occurred among flight crew resulting in domestic infection&#xD;
      recently. Low neutralizing antibody was found in a proportion of fully vaccinated flight crew&#xD;
      and healthcare workers. A 3rd booster COVID-19 dose is considered for flight crew and&#xD;
      healthcare workers. This study is to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of heterologous 3rd booster of mRNA and protein COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Safety concerns of COVID-19 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine have led to a recommendation of&#xD;
      heterologous boost with mRNA vaccine in several countries. Initial safety data of&#xD;
      heterologous prime-boost with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 vaccines showed well-tolerated. No&#xD;
      major differences in reactogenicity were observed between homologous and heterologous&#xD;
      vaccination. Immunogenicity of heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 vaccination is&#xD;
      better compared with homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. Despite the scarcity of safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and mRNA 1273 vaccination, the preliminary&#xD;
      reports revealed similar findings. Although both T and B memory cells contribute to the&#xD;
      protection, there is evidence that neutralizing serum antibody levels have high correlates of&#xD;
      protection for symptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection. The SARS-COV-2 specific antibody and&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody level induced by adenovirus vector vaccines were lower than mRNA&#xD;
      vaccines. Vaccine efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was lower than BNT162b2 and mRNA 1273 in&#xD;
      clinical trials. In the real world, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine appeared less effective than&#xD;
      the BNT162b2 and mRNA1273 vaccine in preventing SARS-COV-2 infection. The emergence of highly&#xD;
      transmissible and mutant variants of SARS-COV-2 has raised the concern of COVID-19 vaccine&#xD;
      effectiveness. The S protein of the widespread SARS-COV-2 delta variant reduced the binding&#xD;
      of neutralizing antibodies. Breakthrough infections are increasing worldwide. Vaccine&#xD;
      effectiveness decreased significantly after the emergence of the SARS-COV-2 delta variant.&#xD;
      Waning immunity is another potential cause of breakthrough infection. Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control of the United States has advocated 3rd booster dose of mRNA vaccine for people at&#xD;
      risk of COVID-19 and those who work in high-risk settings including healthcare workers.&#xD;
      Israel expanded its 3rd COVID-19 vaccine boost to those aged over 12 years old. The complete&#xD;
      vaccination rate is still low in Taiwan. Strict border control measures are imposed by&#xD;
      Central Epidemic Command Center. However, the measure of quarantine for flight crew is&#xD;
      considered one of the breaches of COVID-19 infection control. Despite most of the flight crew&#xD;
      has fully vaccinated, several episodes of breakthrough infection occurred among flight crew&#xD;
      resulting in domestic infection recently. Low neutralizing antibody was found in a proportion&#xD;
      of fully vaccinated flight crew and healthcare workers. A 3rd booster COVID-19 dose is&#xD;
      considered for flight crew and healthcare workers. This study is to determine the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of heterologous 3rd booster of mRNA and protein COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
