  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High intensity exercise is known to improve a person's ability to learn new motor skills. The&#xD;
      goal of this project is to evaluate if a robotic exosuit can help people who have had a&#xD;
      stroke perform walking rehabilitation at higher intensities than they are able to without the&#xD;
      exosuit. The investigators will measure exercise training intensity, biomarkers of&#xD;
      neuroplasticity (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor; BDNF), and motor learning when&#xD;
      people poststroke exercise with and without the exosuit. For this protocol, exosuits&#xD;
      developed in collaboration with ReWalk™ Robotics will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the effects of a soft robotic exosuit on gait training intensity and serum&#xD;
      BDNF in persons post-stroke completing a single bout of high intensity walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Exosuits will allow individuals post-stroke to (i) walk at higher intensities&#xD;
      or (ii) walk at a high intensity for longer durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Training at a higher intensity, or training at high intensity for longer&#xD;
      durations, will result in increased serum BDNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the effects of a soft robotic exosuit on gait biomechanics measured after a&#xD;
      single bout of high intensity walking with versus without a soft robotic exosuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: A single bout of high intensity walking with an exosuit will lead to&#xD;
      demonstrably better gait biomechanics than a single bout of high intensity exercise without&#xD;
      an exosuit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies of the exosuit technology have culminated in strong evidence for the&#xD;
      gait-restorative effects of soft robotic exosuits for patients post-stroke by means of&#xD;
      substitution for impaired paretic limb function during walking. The present study builds on&#xD;
      this work by suggesting that an exosuit's immediate gait-restorative effects can be leveraged&#xD;
      during high intensity gait training to produce post-training improvements in gait quality.&#xD;
      Indeed, current rehabilitation efforts are focused on either quality or intensity. They focus&#xD;
      on gait quality by reducing the training intensity to allow patients to achieve a more normal&#xD;
      gait. In contrast, efforts focused on training intensity push participants without regard for&#xD;
      the quality of their movements. The investigators posit that exosuits can uniquely enable&#xD;
      high intensity gait training that promotes quality of movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute bouts of high intensity exercise prior to skilled task practice have been shown to&#xD;
      enhance motor learning in neurologically intact individuals. However, the impact of high&#xD;
      intensity exercise on motor learning in clinical populations remains largely unknown. A major&#xD;
      limitation to studying this relationship in survivors of stroke are challenges in achieving&#xD;
      and maintaining high intensity exercise levels (&gt;75% max HR) during gait training for&#xD;
      durations that are comparable to neurologically intact individuals. Exercising at a lower&#xD;
      intensity or for a shorter duration may result in insufficient neurological &quot;priming&quot; for&#xD;
      motor learning that typically follows high intensity training-which would be evidenced in&#xD;
      reduced production of activity-dependent markers of neuroplasticity (e.g., brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor; BDNF). For this study, the investigators will use standardized, maximal&#xD;
      effort tests to evaluate the ability of a soft robotic exosuit to increase a patient's&#xD;
      capacity for high intensity gait training. The investigators will also examine the resulting&#xD;
      effect on BDNF and the relationship between training intensity, BDNF and motor learning&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
