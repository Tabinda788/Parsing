  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I objective is to determine the feasibility of the EPP program by examining user&#xD;
      responses to the first three units of EPP's nine interactive training modules. This&#xD;
      feasibility evaluation will track and analyze individual program usage and examine changes in&#xD;
      parents' psychological flexibility, parents' stress, parenting self-efficacy, parents'&#xD;
      mindfulness and child behavior in a within subject pretest and posttest design with 50&#xD;
      parents of children who have DD. Qualifying parents will complete a baseline assessment and&#xD;
      then be directed to our online learning platform to complete the interactive learning&#xD;
      activities. This test of the Phase I prototype is intended to approximate the conditions&#xD;
      under which the complete product will be marketed and used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents who have children with developmental disabilities (DD) commonly experience high&#xD;
      levels of stress related to child behavior problems and contextual issues related to the&#xD;
      child's disability that can have a detrimental effect on their parenting. Current stress&#xD;
      management programs for this population of parents often do not lead to a reduction in&#xD;
      children's behavior problems and Behavioral Parent Training programs (BPT) do not always lead&#xD;
      to a reduction in stress. Interventions that combine the two approaches are more effective,&#xD;
      providing substantial benefits to both parent and child. The central goal of this project is&#xD;
      to create an online, interactive stress reduction and BPT program: The Effective Parenting&#xD;
      Program (EPP): An Integrated Parenting Intervention for Families of Children with&#xD;
      Developmental Disabilities. The investigators propose three Specific Aims with the primary&#xD;
      aims of reducing parents' stress and strengthening parents' parenting efficacy and&#xD;
      psychological flexibility. The investigators secondary aims are designed to answer questions&#xD;
      regarding (a) the influence of changes in parents' efficacy and psychological flexibility on&#xD;
      child behavior and (b) the role of parents' attention to and awareness of present moment&#xD;
      experiences. This work is significant because it will provide resources for an underserved&#xD;
      population - parents of children with DD -- who experience frequent stress with the&#xD;
      challenges of raising a child with DD and who may lack basic behavioral parenting skills.&#xD;
      Moreover, the proposed program has the potential to broadly impact the way supports are&#xD;
      delivered to parents of children with DD by adding an integrated, efficacious intervention&#xD;
      that overcomes common barriers to parental participation (time, finances, and availability).&#xD;
      From a public health perspective, this approach is ideally structured to meet the needs of&#xD;
      this population of parents who are in need of easy to implement and cost effective support&#xD;
      and training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion in Phase II, parents will have access to a complete EPP program, designed to&#xD;
      help parents cope with stress more effectively and strengthen their behavioral parenting&#xD;
      skills. The program will provide parents with engaging, interactive content, including: tools&#xD;
      for monitoring progress, text prompts and incentives to motivate behavior change, a mechanism&#xD;
      for the sharing of social support, guidance in setting effective value-based goals,&#xD;
      strategies for reducing stress, and training in evidence-based parenting skills. The EPP&#xD;
      program will be available on a mobile website that can be accessed by smart phones, tablets&#xD;
      and computers and will provide realistic situational videos vignettes, workbook exercises and&#xD;
      a discussion forum to help parents deal effectively with stress and challenging behaviors. In&#xD;
      Phase I of this project, the investigators will determine the feasibility of the program by&#xD;
      examining primary and secondary outcomes related to a prototype of the EEP program.&#xD;
