    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify which mindfulness technique, or combination of&#xD;
      mindfulness techniques, is most effective at mediating or eliminating stress in emerging&#xD;
      adults who are sexual and gender as well as racial or ethnic minorities. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of eight conditions that are composed of the mindfulness techniques&#xD;
      of Awareness, Purpose, and Connection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Underrepresented racial/ethnic sexual and gender minorities (SGM) aged 18-29 will be&#xD;
      recruited via convenience sampling from social media websites (e.g. Facebook, Instagram) and&#xD;
      listservs from NYU student groups and through LGBT community partners. Interested persons who&#xD;
      screen eligible through the study's online eligibility screener will be asked to provide&#xD;
      their phone number and/or email address to be contacted by a research assistant. An online&#xD;
      meeting via Zoom will then be scheduled to confirm eligibility, provide additional&#xD;
      information concerning study parameters. The online meeting will be between the research&#xD;
      assistant and a single participant. The meeting will take between 10 to 15 minutes depending&#xD;
      on the questions individuals may have. The meeting will be an informational assessment to&#xD;
      assure that the individual can effectively use and have access to the materials used in the&#xD;
      study, the online surveys/assessments, and interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing online informed consent through REDCap, the participant will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of the 8 mindfulness conditions, complete a 30-minute baseline survey via REDCap,&#xD;
      and be provided with training on study protocols. Participants will engage in the study of a&#xD;
      5-day period (starting after the baseline survey). Participants will engage in one of 8&#xD;
      interventions, depending on randomization, in which participants will engage with mindfulness&#xD;
      activities each night for a total of 5 nights which is expected to take 10-20 minutes per day&#xD;
      (the exception to this is the control condition who only receives an introduction to&#xD;
      mindfulness on day 1). In addition, each night over the 5-day period, participants will be&#xD;
      sent a REDCap survey to complete a &quot;nightly diary&quot; which will take about 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the 5-day protocol, participants will be scheduled for an online Zoom&#xD;
      meeting where participants will engage in a 30-40 minute debrief interview and be&#xD;
      renumerated. The Zoom meetings will be between a research assistant and a single participant.&#xD;
      Lastly, in order to improve retention, RA's will perform check-in calls twice during the&#xD;
      5-day daily diary period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions will be administered using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). The&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to at least one of the 3 intervention components of&#xD;
      Awareness, Purpose, and Connection for this optimization study, which make up the 8&#xD;
      conditions. Each of these components is known to be effective in reducing stress and&#xD;
      promoting well-being among populations that experience a high rate of discrimination (e.g.,&#xD;
      SGM). The three components are administered via the Healthy Minds Program (HMP), which is a&#xD;
      smartphone app-based mindfulness intervention developed through the research of Dr. Richard&#xD;
      Davidson and his team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Center for Healthy Minds in&#xD;
      affiliation with the non-profit Healthy Minds Innovations (HMI). The app provides an average&#xD;
      of 10-minute meditations that can be completed while sitting, walking, or exercising that&#xD;
      focus on the modules of Awareness, Purpose, and Connection. Participants will log into the&#xD;
      app and listen to the meditations that correspond to their selected randomization on each of&#xD;
      the 5 days. The app's methodology aligns with constituents of psychological well-being that&#xD;
      are trainable and measurable as evidenced by the Center for Healthy Minds: Awareness,&#xD;
      Purpose, and Connection. The components are as follows: 1) Awareness through meditation&#xD;
      promotes self-awareness, reducing the mind's ability to be distracted and instead be present&#xD;
      at the moment. Awareness promotes well-being by bringing attention to the present moment, not&#xD;
      allowing the mind to wander to negative thoughts that cause stress; 2) Purpose through&#xD;
      meditation promotes mindfulness of one's thoughts and feelings in the present moment and&#xD;
      encourages compassion with oneself and positive reappraisal; 3) Connection through meditation&#xD;
      supports empathy, compassion, and kindness in daily activities. By shifting to this positive&#xD;
      mindset, individuals are able to cultivate social support networks which research has found&#xD;
      to decrease the risk for depression.&#xD;
