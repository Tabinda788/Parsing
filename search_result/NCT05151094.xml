  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this project is to understand clinical features, clinical outcomes and efficacy and&#xD;
      safety profiles of different therapies by analyzing a cohort of COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      hospitalized and treated in a tertiary-level institution, University hospital Dubrava.&#xD;
      Patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics, drug exposure and outcomes are obtained by&#xD;
      analysis of written and electronical medical records.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      University Hospital Dubrava has been completely repurposed during the COVID-19 pandemic to&#xD;
      become high volume COVID-19 tertiary institution. Establishment of hospital registry project&#xD;
      is necessary to properly understand disease characteristic, related outcomes and real-life&#xD;
      treatment patterns. Registry provides a fundamental framework for future upgrading with&#xD;
      emerging or retrogradely obtained specific data that will substantially facilitate&#xD;
      understanding of COVID-19 in the context of other specific diseases, therapies and&#xD;
      procedures. Large comprehensive database will provide sufficient statistical power to allow&#xD;
      for investigation of large number of subgroups and existence of interactions between&#xD;
      different variables. Assessment of large number of clinically important outcomes (mortality,&#xD;
      occurrence of venous and arterial thromboses, major bleeding, bacteriemia, incidence of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission) is necessary to put any&#xD;
      investigated parameter in the proper efficacy and safety context.&#xD;
