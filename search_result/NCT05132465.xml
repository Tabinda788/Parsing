      What research question is being addressed?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can improve the prediction of adverse outcomes be improved for people following a stroke to&#xD;
      optimise their treatment and care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      How is it of relevance and importance to patients and public?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a stroke, people are at a higher risk of developing certain conditions including&#xD;
      heart failure, another stroke and atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart rhythm. In&#xD;
      the proposed study, the investigators will look at factors which may increase a person's risk&#xD;
      of such conditions following stroke. From this, the investigators will determine if risk&#xD;
      scores for these conditions can be improved for people post-stroke. This could help doctors&#xD;
      decide what treatments are best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who would be eligible?&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adults at participating hospitals who have had an ischaemic stroke (where the stroke is&#xD;
      caused by loss of blood flow to the brain) or a transient ischaemic attack ('mini-stroke')&#xD;
      confirmed by a stroke doctor. All patients will be asked to take part in the study, or their&#xD;
      family members may be asked to provide advice on their behalf if the patient is unable to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where is the study being conducted?&#xD;
&#xD;
      At participating hospitals in England and Wales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will the participants undergo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of stroke, patients have a lot of information collected about their health, the&#xD;
      investigators will copy information from patient's medical records about their health after&#xD;
      they agree to take part in the study. Patients or their family members will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete some additional brief questionnaires about their quality of life, wellbeing and&#xD;
      fatigue. Some questionnaires such as for cognitive function are already collected for&#xD;
      patients following a stroke, but where this information has not been collected, it will be&#xD;
      collected for the study. The investigators will ask the patients if they can be contacted in&#xD;
      12-months to repeat the questionnaires and information collected about their health.&#xD;

      Study purpose and design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with prior stroke are at a high-risk of incident adverse cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
      including heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), recurrent stroke and vascular cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and dementia. However, there is a need to clarify the underlying risk factors for&#xD;
      these outcomes specific to post-stroke populations. Extensive research has been conducted to&#xD;
      identify individuals at high-risk of cardiovascular disease through the development of risk&#xD;
      prediction models. This has led to the incorporation of risk models for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease into guidelines for clinical practice with an aim to improve patient-centred care and&#xD;
      decision-making. Risk factors frequently incorporated in such models include age, male sex,&#xD;
      hypertension, cholesterol, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Although some risk prediction&#xD;
      models have examined cardiovascular outcomes such as AF in people post-stroke, further&#xD;
      research is needed to refine these models and make recommendations for implementation to&#xD;
      clinical practice. Identifying precise risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      cardiovascular-related complications in people post-stroke is needed to target screening for&#xD;
      conditions (such as AF) and develop targeted intervention strategies specific to this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudo-anonymised data using the unique, non-identifiable participant ID will be collected in&#xD;
      an electronic case report form using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCapÍ¾&#xD;
      https://www.project-redcap.org). The data entered in to REDCap for the first 20 patients&#xD;
      recruited at each site will be remotely checked for completeness. The data entered onto&#xD;
      REDCap will be checked against electronic medical records and paper questionnaires at&#xD;
      selected sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data checks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data fields in REDCap have been set with predefined rules for range or consistency and&#xD;
      error messages will display when these rules are violated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      As one of the main aims of the study is to examine post-stroke risk prediction models for AF,&#xD;
      this will be used to determine the sample size. Post-stroke prevalence of AF has been&#xD;
      estimated at approximately 24%. Based on the 24% and with a conservative estimate of 15 cases&#xD;
      required per variable in the model, 195 cases would be appropriate for a 13-variable model,&#xD;
      which is the maximum number of variables included in previous AF prediction models.&#xD;
      Therefore, 815 participants would give approximately 195 patients who develop AF required for&#xD;
      the model. The study aims to recruit these participants and 20% extra to account for&#xD;
      potential loss to follow-up, resulting in a minimum of 978 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected will be quantitative. Data will be analysed by members of the research&#xD;
      team at the Liverpool Centre for Cardiovascular Science. Cox proportional hazard models&#xD;
      adjusted for potential confounding factors will be used to examine associations between risk&#xD;
      factors and cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Risk models identified in previous studies&#xD;
      for AF and cardiovascular-related outcomes including cardiovascular disease, physical&#xD;
      function, cognitive impairment and dementia, quality-of-life, and all-cause and&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality will be examined in the L-HARP stroke cohort. Receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curves will be constructed, and Harrell C indexes (i.e. area under the curve)&#xD;
      will be estimated as a measure of model performance and compared using the DeLong test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to traditional epidemiological approaches to risk prediction modelling, machine&#xD;
      learning methodologies will also be examined. Machine learning has been shown to produce&#xD;
      comparable results to traditional cardiovascular disease risk prediction scores, but with&#xD;
      advantages such as examining all available data in an unbiased approach which could lead to&#xD;
      the discovery of new relationships among data. As the sample is not very large, traditional&#xD;
      machine learning techniques including k-Nearest Neighbours, random forest, and decision tree&#xD;
      will be utilised rather than deep learning techniques which are usually applied to very large&#xD;
      datasets. A subset of the data will be used for the training of the model and the rest of the&#xD;
      data will be used for the evaluation of the model. The model derived from machine learning&#xD;
      will be compared to risk prediction models described in previous studies. The accuracy,&#xD;
      specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the&#xD;
      models will be compared.&#xD;
