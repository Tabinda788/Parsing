      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the prevalence of diabetes will&#xD;
      increase by 51% from 463 million in 2019 to 743 million in 2045 among adults between the ages&#xD;
      of 20-79 years. This increase is projected to be 15% in Europe, 33% in North America, 74% in&#xD;
      South East Asia and 143% in Africa from 2019 to 2045. About 3 in 5 participants who have&#xD;
      diabetes in Africa remain undiagnosed. Whereas the total diabetes related health expenditure&#xD;
      is 494 billion USD in high income countries, and 264 billion USD in middle income countries,&#xD;
      low income countries expend only 1 billion USD. Therefore, diabetes is a huge problem&#xD;
      worldwide especially in low income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes which leads to&#xD;
      blindness if left untreated. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness&#xD;
      especially among the working group when vision is very important for daily living. Diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy is identified in a third of diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) however can be treated effectively but early detection and timely&#xD;
      referrals are essential for successful outcomes. Early diagnosis, timely referrals and access&#xD;
      to treatment through a comprehensive and systematic surveillance of the diabetic population&#xD;
      has been shown to be clinically effective and cost effective. The United Kingdom (UK) has a&#xD;
      national population based diabetic retinopathy screening programme which has been very&#xD;
      successful. These screening programmes are non-existent or inadequately developed in many&#xD;
      resource constrained settings. A study was recently concluded in Vietnam in which&#xD;
      non-physician graders were trained to screen for diabetic retinopathy among the population of&#xD;
      diabetic patients. The study also assessed the accuracy of DR grading among medical graders&#xD;
      versus non-physician graders in Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this current study is to develop and test a low cost opportunistic glaucoma&#xD;
      screening model during diabetic retinopathy screening using the same non physician graders&#xD;
      currently used in the recently concluded diabetic retinopathy (DR) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic optic nerve changes and&#xD;
      functional visual field defects which in part is related to a raised intraocular pressure&#xD;
      (IOP). The disease is characterized by typical pattern of damage to the optic nerve, loss of&#xD;
      retinal ganglion cells, and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Glaucoma can be&#xD;
      divided into two main types based on the morphology of the anterior chamber angle: there is&#xD;
      the open angle and the angle closure glaucoma. These two types of glaucoma have different&#xD;
      risk factors, different natural histories and different management. There are other forms of&#xD;
      classification which include primary and secondary glaucomas depending on the etiology of the&#xD;
      glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally. An estimated 60.5&#xD;
      million persons were said to be affected by glaucoma in 2010. Glaucoma is a huge problem&#xD;
      worldwide especially in developing countries. The disease however can be managed with&#xD;
      medical, laser, and surgical forms of treatment. Reduction of intraocular pressure by 30-50%&#xD;
      from baseline usually stops progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that the increasing life expectancy especially of Asians and Africans&#xD;
      may lead to an increase in the prevalence of glaucoma by 74% from 2013 to 2040. It is&#xD;
      projected that the prevalence of glaucoma will increase from 64.3 million to 111.8 million in&#xD;
      2040, and that glaucoma will disproportionately affect people residing in Africa and Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma often progresses unnoticed by the patient until central visual acuity is affected,&#xD;
      therefore early detection of the disease is important before symptoms develop. The rate of&#xD;
      undiagnosed disease however is quite high in developing countries with a large proportion not&#xD;
      being aware of the disease. It is estimated that about 95% are not aware of their glaucoma in&#xD;
      developing countries while 50% are unaware of the disease in developed countries. Early&#xD;
      detection of glaucoma requires some form of screening. Screening of any disease is a form of&#xD;
      secondary prevention and the goal is often to prevent undesired outcomes. In the context of&#xD;
      glaucoma, screening helps to diagnose it in the asymptomatic stage so that treatment can be&#xD;
      started earlier to slow down or prevent progression of the disease to blindness. In a recent&#xD;
      study on the burden of undetected untreated glaucoma in the United States, it was reported&#xD;
      that the odds of having undiagnosed glaucoma was highest among blacks with a 4.4 times&#xD;
      greater odds compared with Caucasians. This disparity was attributed to uneven access to&#xD;
      health care by blacks. One way to alleviate this is to conduct population based screening for&#xD;
      glaucoma. But this has not been found to be cost effective in developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a very recent study published in the Lancet Global Health, however, population screening&#xD;
      was reported to be cost effective in China. In a study on the cost effectiveness of community&#xD;
      screening for glaucoma in rural India, it was reported that community screening would prevent&#xD;
      2,190 person years blindness over a 10 year period. It was concluded that community&#xD;
      population screening may be cost effective if targeted at 40-69 years' age group and if&#xD;
      implemented in urban areas. A study in China recently demonstrated using a decision analytic&#xD;
      Markov model that population screening for both primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and&#xD;
      primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) was cost effective in both rural and urban China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that screening of two major blinding eye diseases (glaucoma and diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy) using the same facilities is likely to be more cost effective. Opportunistic&#xD;
      glaucoma screening can be more cost effective especially when it is piggy bagged into another&#xD;
      screening programme. Diabetic retinopathy screening has been ongoing with the use of optic&#xD;
      nerve photos. It is possible to train the same non- physician graders who are currently&#xD;
      screening for diabetic retinopathy to also screen for glaucoma using the same facilities and&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of non-physician graders to conduct screening in low-resource settings is&#xD;
      particularly important as these are the group of health workers who have been trained to&#xD;
      screen for diabetes. In addition, it reduces the burden on scarce, highly-trained health care&#xD;
      providers in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a training course for screening glaucoma using fundus images obtained during&#xD;
           diabetic retinopathy screening by non-physician graders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test this training course among non-physician graders in Vietnam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main research question Can trained non-physician graders accurately screen for glaucoma&#xD;
      during diabetic retinopathy screening?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an uncontrolled interventional experimental before and after study in&#xD;
      which a minimum of 42 non-physician graders shall be trained to screen for glaucoma using&#xD;
      optic nerve photos obtained for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study flow will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-physician graders are consented, enrolled and undergo testing on the standard image&#xD;
           set at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The non-physician graders complete the training course. There are questions at the end&#xD;
           of each module of the course and participants must pass the revision questions. Those&#xD;
           failing to pass any aspects of the revision questions must review those parts of the&#xD;
           course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-physician graders will undergo a post course test on the standard image set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their performance will be compared to baseline and also to that of ophthalmologists who are&#xD;
      taking part in the DR grading programme, but who have not taken the optic nerve grading&#xD;
      course&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Non-physician graders will undergo a post course test on the standard image set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their performance will be compared to baseline and also to that of ophthalmologists who are&#xD;
      taking part in the DR grading programme, but who have not taken the optic nerve grading&#xD;
      course&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Image training set and Test Set:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will each consist of about 50 normal optic nerve images of people without glaucoma and&#xD;
      about 50 images of people with glaucoma, obtained from the on-going ORBIS CAFÉ DR screening&#xD;
      programme (in which the graders are working), population-based eye studies in the UK (NICOLA)&#xD;
      and the standard Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy Evaluation (GONE) set of images.&#xD;
      (https://gone-project.com/newgone/)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and evaluating competencies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training shall be done online, using the Cyber-sight website of Orbis, The course has been&#xD;
      created specifically for the study by the investigators, modified from materials used to&#xD;
      teach physicians on the World Glaucoma Association and GONE websites and training courses for&#xD;
      ophthalmology residents. A minimum threshold of 70% accuracy on a previously-designed test&#xD;
      set will be considered as adequate competency. Participants who score less than 70% on the&#xD;
      test will have a teacher led training course after which the participants will repeat the&#xD;
      test again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vietnam non-physician and ophthalmologist DR image graders: These persons are already trained&#xD;
      to screen and grade diabetic retinopathy and will be recruited by asking them about their&#xD;
      willingness to take part in the study. Informed consent will be obtained, and participants&#xD;
      will be allowed to participate voluntarily .and if they told that if they choose not to&#xD;
      participate in the study, their jobs will not be affected in anyway. A minimum of 42&#xD;
      non-physician and 12 ophthalmologist graders shall be included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned statistical analysis of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Sample Size &amp; Methods: The minimum sample size of 42 participants was calculated&#xD;
      using the paired sample size formula for quantitative outcome data with confidence level of&#xD;
      95% and statistical power of 80%. Using the statistics from the Glaucoma Optic Neuropathy&#xD;
      Evaluation study (GONE), we assumed that the mean baseline score would be the same as the 5th&#xD;
      percentile score on the GONE evaluation course which is 29%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the course, we assumed that the mean score would be the same as the 45th -50th&#xD;
      percentile score on the GONE evaluation course which is 60%. Briefly the GONE online course&#xD;
      was designed to evaluate participant's skills in evaluating the optic nerve head for&#xD;
      glaucoma. It was started in 2015 and as of October 2021, there had been 45,619 attempts by&#xD;
      11,287 individuals. However, when only first attempts and those who had completed at least&#xD;
      80% of the course were considered, this number reduced to 3666 participants. This course&#xD;
      consists of 15 disc images in all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity and specificity (with 95% confidence Intervals (CI's)), positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive values, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and kappa&#xD;
      statistic comparing non-physician and ophthalmologist graders in Vietnam with the grades on&#xD;
      the standard image sets shall be performed. The performance of non-physician graders after&#xD;
      training will be compared to that before training, and also to that of ophthalmologists who&#xD;
      have not taken the optic nerve course but are working as DR graders in the CAFÉ programme,&#xD;
      with the main outcome for comparison being the area under the receiver-operator curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Protection issues Participants from whom optic nerve images were obtained shall not be&#xD;
      formally enrolled into this study. Only their de-identified optic nerve images will be used&#xD;
      in this study and analysis of images shall be done in a de-identified fashion. Although optic&#xD;
      nerve images are considered personal data, all images are fully anonymized and de-identified.&#xD;
      Blanket permission for research use of images was obtained in the NICOLA, HANDAN and the GONE&#xD;
      studies. These studies have full ethical approvals and obtained consent from participants to&#xD;
      use the images in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All electronic copies of data shall be stored on password-protected computers with written&#xD;
      log books and password protected access to buildings. All paper copies of data will be locked&#xD;
      in a specific filing cabinets in QUB. All optic nerve photos will be anonymized, completely&#xD;
      de-identified and kept in a safe, password-protected server at QUB. All data produced from&#xD;
      this study shall be completely anonymized.&#xD;
