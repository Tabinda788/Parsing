    <textblock>
      Understanding long-term complications after intensive care is important to be able to offer&#xD;
      prophylactic and therapeutic measures to post-intensive care unit (ICU) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since patients in the ICU experience life threatening conditions, severe psychological and&#xD;
      physical stress, we hypothesized that patients after ICU have an increased risk of mental&#xD;
      illnesses specifically anxiety disorders, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD). Moreover, we hypothesized that the prevalence and severity of mental illnesses are&#xD;
      related to the extent of intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our endpoints are the prevalence of anxiety disorders, depression one year after ICU-care and&#xD;
      if the extent of intensive care an independent predictor of psychiatric illness one year&#xD;
      after ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess Swedish Intensive Care registry data for all adult ICU patients admitted&#xD;
      between 2010-2015 and assess ICD-10 codes for anxiety disorders, depression and PTSD one year&#xD;
      after ICU admission.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      As intensive care unit (ICU)-mortality rates are improving in many areas, research focus has&#xD;
      turned towards sequelae after ICU-care. The term Post Intensive Care Syndrome has been&#xD;
      coined, concluding a high frequency of mental illness, cognitive and physical impairment&#xD;
      immediately after ICU-care. Since patients in the ICU experience life threatening conditions,&#xD;
      severe psychological and physical stress, we hypothesize that patients after ICU have an&#xD;
      increased risk of long-term mental illnesses that increase with the extent of intensive care,&#xD;
      specifically anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Current data on the extent&#xD;
      and severity of mental illness after intensive care, and if intensive care is an independent&#xD;
      predictor of it, is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to assess in nationwide data if extensive ICU-treatment contributes to&#xD;
      mental illness. Extensive ICU-treatment will be defined in our dataset as ICU-treatment of&#xD;
      patients in need of invasive ventilation, and/or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).&#xD;
      Our endpoints are prevalence of mental illness one year after discharge, and its association&#xD;
      between extent of ICU-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the Swedish intensive Care registry of intensive care patients treated between&#xD;
      2010 and 2015 for extracting data on Data on Invasive ventilation treatment, CRRT-treatment,&#xD;
      gender and age. ICD-10 codes corresponding for anxiety, PTSD and depression, and other&#xD;
      diagnoses known to increase the risk of mental illness will be extracted from the Swedish&#xD;
      National Patient Registry. Patients younger than 18 years old and ICU-codes corresponding for&#xD;
      pre-existing anxiety, PTSD, depression, and treatment periods less than 24 hours will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Missing data will be imputed. A multivariable regression model will&#xD;
      be fit using ICU-codes corresponding with mental illness as dependent variable, Invasive&#xD;
      ventilation and CRRT as independent variables, and the other parameters as covariates.&#xD;
