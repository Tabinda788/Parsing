  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the present study is to determine the effects of acute and short-term (14&#xD;
      days) ginseng combined with branch chained amino acids supplementation on endurance exercise&#xD;
      performance and the ability of anti-fatigue. In addition, this study also measured the&#xD;
      performance of continuous attention during recovery period to examine the effect of&#xD;
      supplementation on central fatigue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle fatigue was a common problem after exercise. When fatigue occured, body functions were&#xD;
      affected and changed. Changbai Mountain ginseng had higher anti-fatigue substances than&#xD;
      general commercial ginseng. And recent studies had showed that the supplementation of&#xD;
      branched chain amino acids (BCAA), including leucine, isoleucine and valine, can increase&#xD;
      attention and reduce fatigue. However, its effect on Changbai Mountain ginseng combined with&#xD;
      BCAA was still unclear. Subjects were allocated to Gojinsen® drinks and placebo group (1:1&#xD;
      ratio) for 14 days, and then examined by maximal oxygen consumption, time to exhaustion,&#xD;
      rating of perceived exertion (RPE), oxygen saturation (SPO2) , blood lactate concentration,&#xD;
      and continuous attention performance test (CPT II). The Gojinsen® group significant increased&#xD;
      maximal oxygen consumption, time to exhaustion, and attention compared to placebo group.&#xD;
      Moreover, the Gojinsen® group significant decreased lactate concentration and fatigue&#xD;
      compared to placebo group. By this study, Gojinsen® drinks did not showed absolute&#xD;
      anti-fatigue effect but provided the objective evidence of fatigue-related measurement and&#xD;
      the therapeutic potential for people suffering from exercise fatigue.&#xD;
