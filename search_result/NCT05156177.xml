  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies have shown that the response of solid tumors and normal tissues to&#xD;
      radiotherapy can be regulated by gut microbiota and its metabolites. In this study, the&#xD;
      composition of gut microbiota in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers&#xD;
      undergoing definitive radiotherapy will be analysed together with bacterial metabolites in&#xD;
      stool and blood and a possible correlation with treatment outcome and treatment toxicity will&#xD;
      be determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer patients commonly present with unresectable locoregionally advanced&#xD;
      disease in which radiotherapy is the mainstay of curative-intent treatment albeit at the cost&#xD;
      of substantial acute and late toxicity. Recently discovered mechanisms by which gut&#xD;
      microbiota and its metabolites impact tumor's and normal tissue's response to radiotherapy&#xD;
      offer new ways to improve the therapeutic index of radiotherapy in solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMRAD-HNSCC is a prospective study assessing the correlation between gut microbiota&#xD;
      composition and its metabolites and the response to radiotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer. Stool and serum samples will be&#xD;
      collected at the beginning and at the end of curative radiotherapy treatment. The composition&#xD;
      of gut microbiota will be analysed by ribosomal DNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing of&#xD;
      the DNA isolated from stool samples, whereas targeted metabolomics using liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-mass spectrometry will be performed on stool and serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to deepen the understanding of the role of gut microbiome&#xD;
      and its metabolites in efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in head and neck cancer, and&#xD;
      provide a basis for subsequent exploration to increase therapeutic index by regulating gut&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;
