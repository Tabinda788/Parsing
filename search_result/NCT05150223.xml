  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the effectiveness of functional power training on&#xD;
      attention, gross and fine motor skill, participation and quality of life in children with&#xD;
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by comparing traditional strength training&#xD;
      and their healthy peers. In the literature, there are limited studies that investigate the&#xD;
      effect of power exercise in children with ADHD. But there is no randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      include power exercises which is designed to the National Strength and Conditioning&#xD;
      Association (NSCA) criteria and investigate the effects on attention, gross and fine motor&#xD;
      skill, participation and quality of life in children with ADHD. This study hypothesizes that&#xD;
      power exercises could improve attention, gross and fine motor skill, participation, and&#xD;
      quality of life better than traditional strength training in children with ADHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by&#xD;
      inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. These core symptoms cause poor gross and fine&#xD;
      motor skills. Recent critical review results suggest that motor performance not only consists&#xD;
      of motor response activation. It also includes mental representation of activity, attention,&#xD;
      memory, makes decisions, and control over preponderant responses. These findings support that&#xD;
      ADHD symptoms could affect motor performance negatively. DSM-V (The Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) also specifies the relationship&#xD;
      between ADHD symptoms and poor motor performance. DSM-V pointed out motor difficulties that&#xD;
      occur in ADHD are caused by inattention and impulsivity rather than neurological origin. In&#xD;
      the literature, Tseng et al. investigated ADHD symptom's negative effect on motor performance&#xD;
      in 42 school-aged children with ADHD. Tseng et al.'s study was shown that inattention and&#xD;
      impulsivity were determinative symptoms for motor difficulties. Because of the ADHD's&#xD;
      symptoms' effect on the motor skill, children with ADHD have poor fine manual control, manual&#xD;
      coordination, body coordination, strength, and agility when they are compared with health&#xD;
      peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These motor difficulties affect the academic, social, and daily life of children with ADHD.&#xD;
      They have many restrictions on participation of daily living activities, school, social and&#xD;
      sport activities and have decreased quality of life scores. It is considered that these&#xD;
      symptoms of ADHD related to catecholamine systems. Jeyanthi et al. suggest that exercises&#xD;
      both directly and indirectly affects catecholamine systems. In the literature, there are many&#xD;
      studies that was included different exercise interventions involving children with ADHD. Many&#xD;
      of the studies were shown that exercise had positive effects on ADHD symptoms. However, there&#xD;
      is not enough information about the type, duration, intensity, and frequency of appropriate&#xD;
      exercises. Power exercises can be an appropriate approach given the previously reported&#xD;
      problems in children with ADHD. This type of exercise shown positive effects on the other&#xD;
      populations (CP). The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of power exercises on&#xD;
      children with ADHD by comparing these effects with traditional strength training and their&#xD;
      healthy peers.&#xD;

    <description>CTRS is a reliable and valid 59-item teacher self-report form designed to identify children with ADHD and associated behavioral difficulties. Each item can be scored from 0 to 3; where 0 represents an item is not present and 3 represents an always or definitely present symptom.</description>

    <description>Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2 (BOT-2) is norm referenced and designed to measure gross and fine motor skills in youth 4 to 21 years of age. Standard scores 40 are considered below average, whereas those &gt;40 range from average to above average.</description>

    <description>Muscle Power Sprint Test (MPST) will be used to assess lower extremity muscle power.Peak power and Mean Power (watts) were also calculated and used as markers of anaerobic power in the MPST. Power output for each sprint was calculated using body mass and running times, where power = (body mass Å~ distance2)/time. Peak power was defined as the highest calculated power, while Mean Power was defined as average power over the 6 runs.</description>

    <description>The 30 seconds Repetition Maximum test was used to assess functional muscle strength of the lower extremities. The three closed kinetic chain exercises of lateral step-up test, Sit To Stand and attain stand through half knee were used. The children were instructed to perform as many repetitions as possible in 30 seconds for each of the exercises. Lateral step-up and attain stand through half knee were evaluated bilaterally. The repetition maximum for each side was used to calculate total scores for the left and right side and thus ﬁve ﬁnal scores were obtained.</description>

    <description>Participation and Environment Measurement Child &amp; Youth (PEM-CY) is a parent-report questionnaire to assess participation and environment factors in the home, at school and within community Settings. The participation sections included 10 activities in the home setting, five activities in the school setting and 10 in the community setting. For each activity, parents are asked to determine the participation frequency (how frequently has the child participated with eight options: daily to never), participation involvement (how involved the child is while participating the activity rated on a five-point scale: very involved to minimally involved) and whether change is desired (do the parents want to see change in the child's participation in this type of activity: no or yes, with 5 different types of change).</description>

    <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PEDS-QL) is a generic health related quality of life measure consisting of 4 core scales, physical function (8 items), emotional function (5 items), social function (5 items) and school function (5 items) that is intended for use in healthy and patient populations. Respondents are asked to recall the last month and indicate how frequently - from never to almost always - they have experienced specific phenomena. Item responses (0-100) are averaged to form total and core scores; higher scores indicate higher functioning.</description>
