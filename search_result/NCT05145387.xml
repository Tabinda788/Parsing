  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive anxiety is a common problem that severely impairs short and long term academic&#xD;
      functioning. The transition to middle school (MS) results in increases in anxiety and&#xD;
      decreases in academic functioning. Students with anxiety in particular, due to their&#xD;
      vulnerability to school-based stressors, are at risk for social, emotional and academic&#xD;
      failure during the transition to MS. Unfortunately, the majority of these students do not get&#xD;
      identified. Reducing student anxiety has been associated with improvement in academic&#xD;
      functioning. Because the transition to MS is inevitable, targeting students with excessive&#xD;
      anxiety will help their adjustment to their new school setting, reducing the need for special&#xD;
      education and mental health counseling. No interventions exist to help these students with&#xD;
      this transition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to: (1) develop and assess the feasibility of a brief, multi-component&#xD;
      intervention, referred to as TEAMSS, Transitioning Emotionally and Academically to Middle&#xD;
      School Successfully, to reduce anxiety and improve academic functioning through the&#xD;
      transition to MS using an iterative development process (i.e., expert review, two open&#xD;
      trials, and small randomized controlled trial (RCT)); (2) conduct a pilot RCT comparing the&#xD;
      preliminary impact of TEAMSS, relative to enhanced usual care (EUC), in improving students'&#xD;
      social, behavioral, and academic functioning through the transition to MS; and (3) examine&#xD;
      theory-based mediators, predictors, and moderators of TEAMSS and assess intervention costs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will implement two sequential open trials to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      TEAMSS and assess intervention acceptability and satisfaction (from children, parents and&#xD;
      clinicians). Specifically, data on implementation, acceptability, fidelity and child outcomes&#xD;
      will be collected. After each open trial, feedback (via interviews and standardized measures)&#xD;
      from students, parents and clinicians will be integrated and presented to the TEAMSS&#xD;
      Development Workgroup (TDW) for revision. Potentially eligible 5th grade students&#xD;
      (approximately n = 10) will complete the consent process and conduct baseline 1 evaluations.&#xD;
      Eligible 5th grade students will meet with the 6th grade school clinician for a school tour&#xD;
      and meeting, and will receive written material to foster the successful transition to MS.&#xD;
      Immediately prior to starting 6th grade, these students will be contacted and re-evaluated&#xD;
      (baseline 2) using an abbreviated assessment to confirm eligibility. Within the first 10&#xD;
      weeks of 6th grade, school clinicians will implement TEAMSS with enrolled students and their&#xD;
      parents/teachers. Ten weeks after TEAMSS begins, a post assessment will be completed (i.e.,&#xD;
      in December) followed by an 8-month follow-up, near the end of the school year (i.e., in&#xD;
      May). This process will be repeated for open trial 2 with the exclusion of the 8-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot RCT will be conducted with 4-6 school-based clinicians from 4-6 MSs. Approximately&#xD;
      42 5th grade students from 12 elementary schools (approximately 3-6 students per group) with&#xD;
      elevated anxiety will be recruited. The RCT will be conducted in 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Recruitment, Screening, Baseline Evaluation and Randomization: In Phase 1, 5th&#xD;
      grade students will be referred to study staff for screening and evaluation from 5th grade&#xD;
      teachers, clinicians and parents and self-referrals. Interested parents and students will&#xD;
      contact study staff and complete a brief phone screen (see Recruitment section). Families who&#xD;
      pass the screen will complete informed consent and the full baseline evaluation (consisting&#xD;
      of a diagnostic interview and questionnaires) with an Independent Evaluator. Families who&#xD;
      pass the baseline evaluation will be considered for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Intervention and Monitoring: Eligible students will receive TEAMSS (n = 21) or EUC&#xD;
      (n= 21) depending on their random assignment. Students in both groups will receive the 5th&#xD;
      grade components but only students randomized to TEAMSS will receive the TEAMSS group&#xD;
      sessions (in 6th grade), delivered over 10 weeks. During the 10 weeks of TEAMSS, parents of&#xD;
      students will attend two group meetings and clinicians will consult with at least one teacher&#xD;
      (usually the advisory/homeroom teacher).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Post- and Follow-up Evaluations: At the end of the 10-week intervention phase,&#xD;
      students in both groups will complete the post-intervention (3 months into transition year&#xD;
      i.e., December). Five months after the intervention ends (8 months into the transition year&#xD;
      i.e., May), students in both groups will complete a follow up evaluation to assess the&#xD;
      durability of the intervention. A seventh group with students, and a third group for parents,&#xD;
      occurring approximately four weeks after session 6 will be conducted to debrief (discuss&#xD;
      their experience in the program), ask them about any lingering questions or concerns related&#xD;
      to anxiety, and update them on what was learned.&#xD;
