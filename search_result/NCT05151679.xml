      compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous iron sucrose versus chelated oral iron in the&#xD;
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia late in pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      patients will be recruited from the pregnant women who will attend the outpatient clinic at&#xD;
      Women's Health Hospital Assuit University with the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia&#xD;
      between 26-34 weeks with Hb level 8-10 in the initial visit the patients will be counselled&#xD;
      about the iron therapy, its benefits and risk of discontinuation written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History taking&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Personal history: demographic factors, age and dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Obstetric history: parity, EDD, last delivery, gestational age determined from last&#xD;
                menstrual period or previous early ultrasound scanning report.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Past history: history of chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension, blood&#xD;
                transfusion and either oral or i.v iron treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical examination General examination including pulse, blood pressure, BMI, pallor,&#xD;
           temperature and auscultation of lungs and heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Abdominal examination for fundal level. The patients of the study will be randomly&#xD;
           divided into two groups Group 1 will be treated by I.V ferrous sucrose Group 2 will be&#xD;
           treated by chelated oral iron&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Invetigations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ultrasonography in the initial visit to assess fetal well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood sample will be taken at recruitment on day 0, day 14, day 28, day 40 of&#xD;
                therapy.these time points were chosen on the basis of previous studies and to&#xD;
                minimize inconvenience to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The time points were also chosen to detect any difference in the speed of restoration of&#xD;
           Hb% and iron stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The blood sample will be examined for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Complete blood picture. A sample of 2 ml venous blood will be collected in EDTA&#xD;
                vacutainers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Serum ferritin evaluation. A sample of 2 ml venous blood will be collected in EDTA&#xD;
                vacutainers and separated sera will be stored at 20 C until the time of assay by&#xD;
                turbidimetric technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Total iron binding capacity. A sample of 2 ml venous blood will be collected in&#xD;
                EDTA vacutainers&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Doses and administration Treatment will be started 24rh after initial visit women will&#xD;
           be randomized used random sequence computer generated list in such a way that every&#xD;
           patient had equal chance to be among any of the two groups either to group 1 , where&#xD;
           they will receive I.V ferrous sucrose in the E.U in Women's Health Hospital Assuit&#xD;
           University as an i.v infusion in 250 ml 0.9% sodium chloride slowly over 30 minutes, and&#xD;
           then will be discontinued for another 30 minutes to detect any hypersensitivity&#xD;
           reactions with monitoring of vital signs during infusion, antishock measures will be&#xD;
           prepared beside the patient during administration ( corticosteroids, antihistaminic,&#xD;
           calcium and oxygen ). Patients will be asked to note any symptoms or adverse effects of&#xD;
           treatment such as facial flushing nausea, metallic taste, dyspepsia, and burning at the&#xD;
           site of injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose in mg will be calculated from the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 × weight × ( target - actual Hb ) I g/dl + 500 Target Hb 12 g% The total required dose of&#xD;
      iron will be divided into three doses, which will be given every 3 days, and the maximum&#xD;
      daily dose is 200mg ( 2 ampoules ). This group will not receive further iron supplementation.&#xD;
      They will be asked to note any symptoms or adverse effects of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      or to group 2 where they will receive chelated oral iron, they will be given iron chelated&#xD;
      amino acid containing 15 mg of elemental iron once daily for 6 weeks. the women will be&#xD;
      advised to take 1 tab of iron chelated amino acid containing 15mg of elemental iron once&#xD;
      daily with meals for 6 weeks from the day of recruitment. Date will be given when to stop&#xD;
      oral supplementation after 6 weeks. This group will be advised to note side effects such as&#xD;
      nausea, metallic taste, dyspepsia and constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will add 500µg of folic acid to patients of group 1 once daily for 6 weeks to eliminate&#xD;
      the differences in the results between the groups as ferrotron ( chelated oral iron for&#xD;
      second group ) contains 400µg folic acid.&#xD;
