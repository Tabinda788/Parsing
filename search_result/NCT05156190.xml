  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to test the effectiveness and practicality of study in the Bright Classrooms&#xD;
      with skylight and artificial light renovation in reducing incident myopia in Chinese primary&#xD;
      school children over three years, as compared to children studying in conventional&#xD;
      classrooms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators now propose a cluster-randomized controlled trial of Bright Classrooms to&#xD;
      provide a definitive answer as to their effect on the reduction of myopia incidence with the&#xD;
      interventions of students studying in bright classroom from skylight and artificial light&#xD;
      renovation. The bright classroom trial will be conducted in Jiangxi Province, South-east&#xD;
      China via Nanchang University Affiliated Eye Hospital and the artificial light renovation&#xD;
      study will be in Zhejiang Province via Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University. Classroom&#xD;
      design and build will be supported by leading firm in this space, Velux. If the principal can&#xD;
      be proven that such innovative architectural modifications and classroom light renovation&#xD;
      successfully prevent myopia, it will provide an evidence-based justification for a broad&#xD;
      variety of low-cost retrofits, new build designs and light renovation appropriate for various&#xD;
      Chinese settings. These might include larger windows, skylights, artificial lighting and&#xD;
      appropriate seating arrangements. Once in place, such architectural and light interventions&#xD;
      could benefit children over many years, without extensive and difficult-to-sustain programs&#xD;
      of behaviour change. This proof-of-principle project could address a significant global eye&#xD;
      health challenge and have significant and sustainable socio-economic impact for China and&#xD;
      built environments elsewhere throughout the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools selected for the trial are: Yifen County: 2 schools, Lichuan County: 2 schools,&#xD;
      Yiyang County: 2 schools, Fuliang County: 1 school and Shanggao County: 1 school.&#xD;

          -  Willingness of parents to give consent&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children without consent from their parents will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children having myopia (myopic spherical equivalent refractive error of &lt;= -0.5D in&#xD;
             one or both eyes) at baseline are excluded from the primary analysis, although they&#xD;
             will be included in the secondary analyses, so there will be no need to exclude them&#xD;
             from continuing to study with their classmates and use the assigned classroom.&#xD;
