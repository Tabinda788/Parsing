  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present research aims to carry out a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      study the efficacy of a new antioxidant. The primary outcome variables will be the changes&#xD;
      observed in PD-motor and non-motor symptoms scales, as well as quality of life during a&#xD;
      6-months period. Global impression on the treatment will be rated after this period.&#xD;
      Likewise, presynaptic changes will be studied in positron emission tomography studies, using&#xD;
      2 radiotracers and a dynamic image processing in patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      125 patients who have a definite diagnosis of PD will be included; 25 of them will be&#xD;
      subjected to a triple-blind, clinical and molecular study. In addition, 25 other subjects&#xD;
      from the same Institution and from 4 other collaborating centers will be part of the clinical&#xD;
      arm of this study during the period September 2021- September 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, various clinical data of the participants will be recorded such as:&#xD;
      age, gender, family history, current medical conditions, and drugs dosage in addition to a&#xD;
      comprehensive neurological examination. Subsequently, the signing of the informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained, and general laboratory tests and a brain RMI in 3dT1 and SWI sequences will&#xD;
      be performed. A series of disease-specific scales will be applied in order to assess motor&#xD;
      functional capacity, cognition, sleep, and other non-motor symptoms before drug delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be made in blocks of 5 treatments: 3 nano-PSO and 2 placebos. Treatments&#xD;
      will be delivered in form of bottles containing 100 capsules each after baseline and&#xD;
      intermediate visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 patients will also give their consent to perform 2 PET studies (positron emission&#xD;
      tomography) to assess presynaptic dopaminergic function. This implies conducting these&#xD;
      studies on 2 occasions (at the beginning and at the end of treatment), with emphasis on&#xD;
      striatal activity to study the effect of treatment with Nano-PSO.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new fatty acid extracted from the pomegranate showed unexpectedly beneficial properties&#xD;
      after nanotechnological processing. Encouraging effects of the new substance called nano-PSO&#xD;
      led to design the present investigation. Indeed, the substance is responsible for slowing&#xD;
      down cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer disease models, with an evident protective&#xD;
      mechanism against oxidative mitochondrial damage and also for increasing survival in&#xD;
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease models, among other results in preclinical research. Recently, a&#xD;
      trial realized in multiple sclerosis patients showed beneficial effects on functional&#xD;
      outcomes. In addition, another study showed significant positive results in&#xD;
      tyrosine-hydroxylase activity, mitochondrial enhancement, and motor function in animal models&#xD;
      of PD under nano-PSO treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the design of a clinical trial involving 3 neurological referral centers is&#xD;
      necessary to be able to select and include an appropriate sample of PD patients to evaluate&#xD;
      the benefits of nano-PSO. The time of the study is limited to one year, since this treatment&#xD;
      is already approved for commercialization as a nutritional supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 25 included patients who also give their consent to carry out the PET study&#xD;
      (positron emission tomography on two occasions (at the beginning and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment), with emphasis on striatal presynaptic activity, will provide molecular hard data&#xD;
      for evaluating efficacy of the treatment. Molecular imaging tools are evolving and nowaday&#xD;
      able to obtain changes in dynamic and sensitive variables for the detection of changes due to&#xD;
      treatment; also, it can correlate clinimetric and functional data with unprecedented accuracy&#xD;
      and resolution. Post processing molecular images of involved subjects with appropriate&#xD;
      softwares will return a series of variables including VOI analysis, general kinetic modeling,&#xD;
      pixel-wise modeling, images in 3D and in motion, especial quantitative data processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of the diagnosis and review of the criteria, the process for obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent is carried out. An extended informed consent form was performed for the PET&#xD;
      group of volunteers as they need during the first week of their participation a structural&#xD;
      MRI, the FDG PET-scan and another day to perform the 18 -fluorodopa PET-scan. These studies&#xD;
      are intended to merge images, to study the cerebral metabolism of glucose, dopamine tracing,&#xD;
      and to process dynamic events with a P-Mode software. Patients are aware of the need to&#xD;
      perform a second similar study after 6 months of treatment. The rest of the protocol is&#xD;
      similar for the group subjected to the PET study n=25) and the exclusively clinical study&#xD;
      group (n=100). It consists of the collection of elements of the medical history, blood&#xD;
      samples analysis, ECG, and MRI review ,quality of life and Montreal Cognitive Assessment,&#xD;
      MDS-UPDRS** , Non motor symptoms scale, PD sleep scale, H&amp;Y stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinimetric protocol will be applied at least three times: at baseline, 3-months- after 6&#xD;
      months of treatment. During each interval, a questionnaire will be carried out via telephone,&#xD;
      videoconference or video-call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be connected constantly with a clinician through a smartphone&#xD;
      activated only for research needs. (schedule, report of adverse events, request&#xD;
      transportation etc. ) The protocol has been registered this year, and approved by three&#xD;
      institutional committees: the scientific committee, the ethics and the biosafety committee.&#xD;
      In the two other participating centers, only approval by the Research Ethics committee is&#xD;
      required since PET-scan will not be performed in the study frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular biomarkers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 25 patients who firme a special informed consent will be followed with a&#xD;
      multitracer positron emission tomography (PET) at the basal state and after 6 months of&#xD;
      treatment. PET is an imaging technique using radiotracers to obtain functional images of the&#xD;
      central nervous system. Neuronal loss occurs in a caudal to rostral fashion in PD, from the&#xD;
      brainstem where the hallmark pathology still relies on the Lewy bodies in the SNc. The latter&#xD;
      corresponds to intra-cytoplasmatic alpha-synuclein-positive staining inclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, 18 F-FDG is a glucose analogue and direct marker for GLUT-1 cell membrane expression&#xD;
      and function. This tracer allows diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD and parkinsonian&#xD;
      syndromes. PD is characterized by an increased uptake of FDG in striatal and thalamic areas,&#xD;
      in comparison with cortical and cerebellar regions. This increased uptake is mostly&#xD;
      contralateral to the most affected side. In multiple system atrophy ( MSA) a decreased uptake&#xD;
      is seen and in the MSA-C form, with cerebellar hypometabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PD the mean annual rate of decline in FD uptake reportedly ranges from 8% to 12% in the&#xD;
      putamen and 4-6% in the caudate, while annual decline in healthy volunteers is 0.5% and 0.7%,&#xD;
      respectively. Autopsy studies have shown a 45% decrease in nigral cell counts during the&#xD;
      first 10 years of PD. PET scan using 6-[ 18 F]-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylananine ( 18&#xD;
      F-FDOPA) allow quantification of striatal DOPA decarboxylase activity and storage capacity of&#xD;
      18 F-dopamine . This study can evaluate unlimited depth penetration and take whole body&#xD;
      imaging despite is an expensive exam. Spatial resolution can be co-registered with structural&#xD;
      data from MR images to provide additional anatomical context to the functional PET data. The&#xD;
      first data analysis is both visually and quantitatively. Further dynamic data will be given&#xD;
      by a study of striatal decarboxylase activity and storage of fluoroDOPA by the mean of a&#xD;
      P-mode software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Sample size was calculated to compare the primary clinical outcomes of a nano-PSO&#xD;
      treated group of 60 to 75 subjects with a placebo group of 40 to 50 subjects. A difference of&#xD;
      5 points of changes in the motor scale is arbitrary expected. To estimate the distribution of&#xD;
      this variable (changes in the MDS-UPDRS motor scale, in a sample of 16 patients recently&#xD;
      attended allowed the calculation of a mean of 9.9 points and the standard deviation of 6.69.&#xD;
      Assuming that those in the placebo group do not change their score, while those treated with&#xD;
      nano-PSO earn five points, a sample of 30 subjects in each group was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation for the clinical essay was based on the hypothesis of a gain of 5&#xD;
      points in the MDS-UPDRS motor score in the treated group, assuming a placebo effect of 2&#xD;
      points, a mean change of 5 in the treated group. Standard deviation of 10 obtained in&#xD;
      definite PD cases. With a value for desired power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05, the&#xD;
      sample size for a one-sided test of hypothesis is of 50 cases in each group. An interim&#xD;
      analysis is planned in septembre 2022 when 30 to 50 subjects will finish the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other primary outcome is the gain in non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) with a similar&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** MDS-UPDRS motor sub scale (part III) is assessed in patients submitted to the PET study in&#xD;
      OFF state , and further in ON of Levodopa. All the other subjects are called to come in their&#xD;
      best ON stage during their evaluations.&#xD;
