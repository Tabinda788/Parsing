      Using immersive virtual reality as a form of pain distraction during a brief &quot;painful but&#xD;
      tolerable&quot; temperature.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use Quantitative Sensory Testing (computer-controlled brief 10 second thermal&#xD;
      pain stimuli) in healthy college students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to conduct a randomized, controlled study with healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      explore whether interacting with virtual objects in VR via a highly immersive VR system makes&#xD;
      VR significantly more effective/powerful compared to a less immersive VR system, vs. No VR,&#xD;
      for reducing pain during quantitative sensory testing.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A between-groups design will be used to test the primary hypothesis. A Mixed Model repeated measures ANOVA or non-parametric tests if appropriate will be conducted on worst pain ratings. During the 10 second treatment stimulus, Group 1 will receive No VR, Group 2 will receive Low Tech VR, and Group 3 will receive High Tech VR.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Some of the instructions will be presented by the investigators to the participants via a computer.avatar research assistant (investigator) who remains blind to the participants treatment group. Although no deception is involved, participants who receive VR will remain unaware of the immersiveness of the VR systems they are receiving for their primary treatment.</masking_description>
