  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present investigation is to test the efficacy of a brief (6 sessions)&#xD;
      dyadic (patient and caregiver together) intervention to prevent chronic emotional distress in&#xD;
      at risk dyads admitted to a Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit with an acute brain injury.&#xD;
      Through this study, we seek to solve the unmet need of preventing chronic emotional distress&#xD;
      in Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (NICU) dyads through a feasible, acceptable and credible&#xD;
      program, and ideally improve the recovery trajectory and dyads' overall quality of life.&#xD;

      The goals of this study are to: 1) demonstrate the efficacy of Recovering Together for&#xD;
      improving self-reported emotional distress (primary outcome), and post traumatic stress,&#xD;
      mindfulness, coping, social support and other relevant outcomes (secondary outcomes); and 2)&#xD;
      assess mechanisms (mediators and moderators) of improvement after intervention. We will&#xD;
      enroll and randomly assign 194 at risk dyads (97 per study group) to receive either the&#xD;
      active intervention or educational control. The trial is single blinded (assessors, patients&#xD;
      and staff). The trial will take place at the Massachusetts General Hospital NICU using our&#xD;
      established methodology successfully implemented during the R21 pilot study. Study clinicians&#xD;
      will deliver 6, 30 minute sessions of active intervention or educational control (2 at&#xD;
      bedside and 4 via live video after discharge) to each patient-caregiver dyad. All&#xD;
      participants will complete measures at baseline, after completion of program (6 weeks) and 3&#xD;
      months later. They will also complete measures of emotional distress weekly, as well as&#xD;
      measures assessing home practice.&#xD;

    <description>In the skills-based intervention group, sessions focus on developing skills to cope and manage ANI related stressors. The intervention will be tailored consistent with AHA recommendations for ANI skills-based interventions and will include 2 general and 4 specific modules. It is anticipated that the intervention will have 6 sessions with 2 general sessions delivered, in person if possible, within the NICU, or through live video using Zoom if patients leave the hospital before sessions occur, and 4 tailored specific sessions (chosen from by the dyads from 6 available modules) to be delivered via live video using Zoom.</description>

    <description>Those in the educational program will receive general health information that mimics the skills-based intervention, but without teaching any of the resiliency or interpersonal communication skills that are hypothesized to be responsible for improvement in emotional distress. There will also be 6 sessions, 2 in-person dyadic visits in the NICU and 4 dyadic virtual visits following discharge. The educational program group will not have the opportunity to specify which modules they would like to take; the modules will be predetermined. All participants will receive medical care as determined by their medical team.</description>
