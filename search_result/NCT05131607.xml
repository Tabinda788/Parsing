  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supine breast MRI obtained with a second&#xD;
      intravenous injection of gadolinium contrast immediately after a standard clinical prone&#xD;
      breast MRI will provide sufficient tumor visualization to allow a Radiologist to define and&#xD;
      outline the tumor edges (&quot;segment&quot; the tumor). Accurate segmentation will allow a 3-D image&#xD;
      of the tumor to be generated to create a breast cancer locator (BCL) surgical device to in&#xD;
      aid removal of breast cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical pre-operative breast MRI exam will be obtained in the prone position with&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) Gadolinium (Gd) contrast injection per standard of care clinical protocol.&#xD;
      After completion of the standard clinical prone breast MRI, the participant will be&#xD;
      re-positioned and the investigative supine breast MRI protocol with a second dose of IV Gd&#xD;
      will be obtained. A second dose of contrast equal to the first dose will be given, and&#xD;
      additional images will be obtained in the supine position. Subtraction images will be&#xD;
      generated for both the prone and the supine sequences. It is hypothesized that the second&#xD;
      contrast injection will generate tumor-to-fibroglandular contrast differences such that&#xD;
      supine subtraction images will allow visualization and segmentation of the tumor equal to&#xD;
      prone segmentation images. It is expected that the addition of a second injection of contrast&#xD;
      will improve the ability to visualize and accurately segment the supine post-Gd images. While&#xD;
      the total dose of gadolinium delivered in two injections is twice the amount normally given&#xD;
      during a clinical prone breast MRI, this total dose is equal to that administered for other&#xD;
      clinical MRI studies such as cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional imaging or testing will be required for this research study following the&#xD;
      standard clinical MRI.&#xD;
