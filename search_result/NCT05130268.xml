    <textblock>
      While there are several completed clinical trials that address treatment strategy in patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic and recurrent AF, there are no randomized clinical trials that address&#xD;
      treatment for first-detected AF. In usual care, these patients are started on an&#xD;
      atrioventricular nodal blocking agent (beta-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel&#xD;
      blocker) along with stroke prevention therapy. The investigators hypothesize that earlier&#xD;
      administration of a well-tolerated antiarrhythmic drug proven to reduce hospitalization may&#xD;
      result in improved cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life in patients first-detected AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with dronedarone on top of usual care&#xD;
      is superior to usual care alone for the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization or death&#xD;
      from any cause in patients hospitalized with first-detected AF. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      with guideline-recommended stroke prevention therapy according to the CHA2DS2-VASc score. The&#xD;
      treatment follow-up period will be 12 months. There will be two follow-up visits. Consistent&#xD;
      with the pragmatic nature of the trial, the first follow-up will occur between 3 -9 months&#xD;
      and the 2nd will occur at 12 months (with a window of +/- 30 days). Approximately 3000&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to study intervention. The study&#xD;
      intervention will be dronedarone 400 mg twice daily in addition to usual care versus usual&#xD;
      care alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical&#xD;
      practice, accounting for one-third of arrhythmia-related hospitalizations.1 As many as 1 in 4&#xD;
      people develop AF over their lifetime after the age of 40 years. The prevalence and burden of&#xD;
      AF in the United States is substantial; the age-adjusted incidence and prevalence has&#xD;
      increased over the last 3 decades. Moreover, the number of Americans with AF is expected to&#xD;
      increase 150% by 2050. The goals of care in the treatment of AF include (1) the management&#xD;
      and reduction of risk factors, (2) prevention of tachycardia (rate control), (3) prevention&#xD;
      of stroke, and (4) improvement of symptoms. Reduction or elimination of symptoms often&#xD;
      requires rhythm control. Historically, randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated a&#xD;
      mortality or stroke benefit with a rhythm control versus a rate control strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the failure of prior randomized clinical trials to demonstrate the superiority of&#xD;
      rhythm control, the recent Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention 4&#xD;
      (EAST-AFNET 4) trial demonstrated that early introduction of a comprehensive rhythm-control&#xD;
      strategy (within one year of diagnosis) is superior to guideline-based usual care in&#xD;
      improving cardiovascular (CV) outcomes at a mean follow-up of 5 years. The EAST-AFNET 4 trial&#xD;
      found that early rhythm control reduced the primary outcome of CV death, stroke,&#xD;
      hospitalization for heart failure (HF), or acute coronary syndrome (HR 0.79, 96% confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI) 0.66-0.94, p = 0.005). EAST-AFNET 4 also demonstrated a reduction in the risk&#xD;
      of stroke with early introduction of rhythm control (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.98), a finding&#xD;
      that was also observed with dronedarone in the ATHENA trial. In addition, maintenance of&#xD;
      sinus rhythm has been associated with improved quality of life and increased exercise&#xD;
      capacity in some patients. Outside of clinical trials, a quality-of-life study from the&#xD;
      Registry on Cardiac Rhythm Disorders Assessing the Control of Atrial Fibrillation (RECORD-AF)&#xD;
      found that rhythm control was associated with better quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) available for rhythm control of AF. Class I&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic agents are predominantly limited to younger patients without coronary artery&#xD;
      or structural heart disease. Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, prolonged QT&#xD;
      intervals, and/or severe left ventricular hypertrophy should not be treated with sotalol or&#xD;
      dofetilide. Even when sotalol or dofetilide can be used, patients are often hesitant to start&#xD;
      a medication that requires an inpatient hospitalization for drug loading and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation every 3 months. Amiodarone has been shown to be the most effective AAD for&#xD;
      maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF; however, based on its side effect profile,&#xD;
      amiodarone is only recommended as a first-line agent under specific clinical circumstances.&#xD;
      Moreover, despite its efficacy, amiodarone has high rates of discontinuation due to frequent&#xD;
      adverse events. In addition to its unfavorable side effects, several studies, including those&#xD;
      of patients at risk for sudden cardiac death, have demonstrated an association between&#xD;
      amiodarone use and higher mortality, as well as lower functional status. In contrast to&#xD;
      amiodarone, dronedarone is a much better tolerated antiarrhythmic medication. In randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, dronedarone has been shown to prevent recurrent AF, improve rate control,&#xD;
      and decrease cardiovascular hospitalization in patients with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are several completed clinical trials that address treatment strategy in patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic and recurrent AF, there are no randomized clinical trials that address&#xD;
      treatment for first-detected or new-onset AF. After appropriate evaluation for oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation, these patients are often started on an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent&#xD;
      (beta-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker). The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that earlier administration of a well-tolerated antiarrhythmic drug proven to reduce&#xD;
      hospitalization may result in improved quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with first-detected AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dronedarone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      hospitalization for AF in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. The efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of dronedarone 400 mg twice daily was evaluated in five controlled studies, ATHENA,&#xD;
      ANDROMEDA, European Trial in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving Dronedarone&#xD;
      for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (EURIDIS), ADONIS, and Dronedarone Atrial FibrillatioN&#xD;
      study after Electrical Cardioversion (DAFNE), involving more than 6,000 patients with&#xD;
      including more than 3200 patients who received dronedarone. As with any therapeutic agent,&#xD;
      there are known risks with dronedarone therapy. These risks include hepatic injury, heart&#xD;
      failure exacerbation, increased exposure to digoxin, increased plasma concentration of&#xD;
      tacrolimus, sirolimus, and other Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP 3A) substrates,&#xD;
      and very rare instances of pulmonary toxicity. The risks of dronedarone are felt to be&#xD;
      outweighed by its benefits. The guideline recommendations provided by the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology and American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart&#xD;
      Rhythm Society (HRS) are commensurate with this risk benefit assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are no completed randomized clinical trials to guide selection or initiation of&#xD;
      rhythm control therapies in patients with first-detected AF, there are recent trials that&#xD;
      suggest benefit with both dronedarone antiarrhythmic therapy and early-initiation of rhythm&#xD;
      control in persons with AF. the recent EAST-AFNET 4 trial demonstrated that early&#xD;
      introduction of a comprehensive rhythm-control strategy (within one year of diagnosis) is&#xD;
      superior to usual guideline-recommended care in improving cardiovascular (CV) outcomes at 5&#xD;
      years. The median time from new-onset AF to randomization in the EAST-AFNET4 trial was 36&#xD;
      days. The trial found that early rhythm control reduced the primary outcome of CV death,&#xD;
      stroke, hospitalization for HF, or acute coronary syndrome (HR 0.79, 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      0.66-0.94, p = 0.005). EAST-AFNET 4 also demonstrated a reduction in the risk of stroke with&#xD;
      early introduction of rhythm control (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.98), a finding that was also&#xD;
      observed with dronedarone in the ATHENA trial. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that early&#xD;
      initiation of dronedarone in patients with new-onset AF will lead to a reduction in CV&#xD;
      hospitalization or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dronedarone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV&#xD;
      hospitalization in patients with AF or atrial flutter. However, it is unknown if dronedarone&#xD;
      (or any antiarrhythmic medication) can reduce CV hospitalization or death in patients with&#xD;
      first-detected AF. This trial has been designed to address this important question. In order&#xD;
      to facilitate the trial enrollment, data collection, and a generalizability to clinical&#xD;
      practice, the CHANGE AFIB study has been designed as an open-label pragmatic clinical trial&#xD;
      nested within the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) Atrial Fibrillation registry. At present the&#xD;
      overall GWTG program is being implemented in over 2,300 hospitals across the U.S. and is&#xD;
      comprised of over 9 million patient records, with an estimated 650,000 new patient records&#xD;
      entered per year. The trial will utilize the existing GWTG registry network, data collection&#xD;
      architecture, and experience to facilitate both enrollment and conduct of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparator arm will be &quot;usual care.&quot; Thus, this study will compare usual care plus&#xD;
      dronedarone versus usual care alone. In most patients, the investigators anticipate usual&#xD;
      care to include an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent (beta-blocker, non-dihydropyridine&#xD;
      calcium channel blocker, or digoxin) without an antiarrhythmic. As dronedarone has&#xD;
      anti-adrenergic rate controlling properties, a low dose of beta-blocker or calcium-channel&#xD;
      blocker is recommended in the USPI when starting dronedarone. In the dronedarone arm&#xD;
      concomitant digoxin use will be contraindicated due to P-gp interaction based upon data from&#xD;
      the PALLAS trial. All patients will receive oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention&#xD;
      according to current guideline recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHANGE AFIB will leverage several critical advantages as a pragmatic clinical trial. Data&#xD;
      collection will be integrated into the Get With The Guidelines AFIB registry. The use of the&#xD;
      GWTG-AFIB registry will also enhance subject recruitment and ensure the enrollment of a&#xD;
      diverse group of patients. The randomized intervention will be compared with usual care thus&#xD;
      further enhancing generalizability. Follow-up visits will be minimized to reduce patient&#xD;
      burden. Moreover, follow-up visits will have &quot;windows&quot; to accommodate variation in follow-up&#xD;
      intervals at different centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for Study Drug Intervention and Dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dronedarone is a non-iodinated benzofuran similar to amiodarone but is not associated with&#xD;
      thyroid or pulmonary toxicity in randomized clinical trials or post-marketing observational&#xD;
      studies. Dronedarone has electrophysiological characteristics spanning all 4 Vaughan-Williams&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic classes, with primarily class III effects. Initial trials suggested that&#xD;
      dronedarone prolonged the time to recurrence of AF and reduced cardiovascular death and&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The landmark ATHENA trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of dronedarone in patients with&#xD;
      atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter). This trial did not include&#xD;
      patients with a recent history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure or&#xD;
      recent hospitalization for decompensated heart failure (&lt;4 weeks). Approximately, 30% of the&#xD;
      ATHENA population had NYHA class I-III heart failure. ATHENA demonstrated that dronedarone&#xD;
      400 mg twice daily (in combination with background therapy) reduced the combined endpoint of&#xD;
      CV hospitalization or death from any cause by 24% (p&lt;0.001) compared with placebo. Of course,&#xD;
      the ATHENA trial was not conducted in the special population of patients with a new diagnosis&#xD;
      of AF. There are no randomized trials or guideline recommendations for antiarrhythmic therapy&#xD;
      at the time of first-detected AF. A subgroup analysis from the ATHENA trial suggests that&#xD;
      optimal outcomes may be achieved in those patients with shorter duration of AF (time from&#xD;
      diagnosis). Similar observations have also been made in patients undergoing other forms of&#xD;
      rhythm control, including catheter ablation. In this trial, patients with first-detected AF&#xD;
      will be randomized to dronedarone on top of usual care versus usual care alone. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm will be prescribed and treated with Dronedarone 400 mg&#xD;
      bid. This dose has been chosen as it is the Food and Drug Administration approved dose as&#xD;
      well as the dose recommended in current international guidelines. Dronedarone has also been&#xD;
      shown to be an effective rate control agent as well. In the ERATO study treatment with&#xD;
      dronedarone 400 mg twice daily let to a mean reduction of 24.5 beat/min in patients with&#xD;
      permanent AF when compared with placebo. In the EURIDIS/ADONIS studies the mean difference in&#xD;
      patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF during AF recurrence was 14 beats/min. Moreover, the&#xD;
      dronedarone treated patients experienced improved rate control without any reduction in&#xD;
      exercise tolerance as measured by maximal exercise.&#xD;

    <description>The AFEQT is a 21-item, AF-specific health-related QOL questionnaire that assesses the impact of AF on patient-reported quality of life. The AFEQT includes a summary score (calculated from 18 of the questions) and subscale scores in three domains: symptoms, daily activities, and treatment concern. The summary and subscale scores range from 0 (corresponds to complete AF-related disability) to 100 (no AF-related disability). A change of 5 or more points in the AFEQT has been identified as a benchmark for a clinically meaningful difference in an individual patient.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Quality of Life--MAFSI</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MAFSI was developed as a modification and update of the AF Symptom Checklist. The trial will use a modified MAFSI questionnaire comprised of a 10-item AF symptom checklist that asks about frequency and severity of each symptom. Frequency of symptoms is recorded as 0 (never), 1 (rarely), 2 (sometimes), 3 (often), or 4 (always). These responses are summed for a total Frequency Score that ranges from 0 (no AF symptoms) to 40 (worst score). MAFSI Severity Scores are recorded as 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (extreme). Severity scores are summed and range from 0 (no AF symptoms) to 30 (most severe AF symptoms). A clinically meaningful change in the MAFSI has not previously been established and therefore will be considered to be about ¼ of the pooled baseline standard deviation (SD), or 1.6 points for the Frequency Score and 1.3 points for the Severity Score.</description>
