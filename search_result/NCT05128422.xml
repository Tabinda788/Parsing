    <measure>The 5-level EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire（EQ-5D-5L）score</measure>
    <time_frame>90 ± 14 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>secondary clinical efficacy endpoint, Quality of Life score; The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
