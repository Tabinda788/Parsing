  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, three-period, crossover, single-dose study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of a low-fat meal and a standard meal on the pharmacokinetics of DBPR108 and the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of DBPR108 under different fed states in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of different meal types on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of DBPR108, a potent dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor. In this open-label,&#xD;
      randomized, three-period, crossover study, healthy subjects will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      DBPR108 100 mg under fasted conditions and following a low-fat meal or a standard meal.&#xD;
      Twenty-one healthy subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to Sequence A, Sequence B, or Sequence&#xD;
      C. This study will consist of a screening and baseline period, a treatment period, and a&#xD;
      follow-up period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments will be taken pre-dose and up&#xD;
      to 48 h post-dose.&#xD;
