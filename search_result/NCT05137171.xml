    <textblock>
      Patients with persistent,recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer (histologic types include&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma) who had received at&#xD;
      least once platinum-based systemic chemotherapy were enrolled.Eligible patients receive AK105&#xD;
      200 mg by intravenous (iv.) infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W),and anlotinib 12mg 2 weeks on/1 week&#xD;
      off orally(Q3W).Imaging will be performed after the 3th AK105 administration as 3 cycles.This&#xD;
      study is an open,single-arm,single-center clinical trial,and all the patients will receive&#xD;
      AK105 and anlotinib treatment until radiographic progression,unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      investigator or patient decision to withdraw, non-adherence to treatment or trial procedures.&#xD;
