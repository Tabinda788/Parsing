  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 healthy adult males, ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age, are planned to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 6 cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 6, 1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort&#xD;
      will include 8 subjects (6 subjects receiving a single dose of the study drug NS101 and 2&#xD;
      subjects receiving a single dose of a matching placebo), for a total of 48 subjects planned&#xD;
      for evaluation. A total of 21 blood samples will be collected in each cohort for PK analysis&#xD;
      and a total of 14 blood samples will be collected in each cohort for PD analysis.&#xD;

      The study will consist of 6 cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 6, 1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort&#xD;
      will include 8 subjects (6 subjects receiving a single dose of the study drug NS101 and 2&#xD;
      subjects receiving a single dose of a matching placebo), for a total of 48 subjects planned&#xD;
      for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each dose level, the dose to be administered to each subject for a single infusion will&#xD;
      be calculated based on subject's body weight, measured on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort, subjects will receive a single infusion of NS101 or matching placebo under&#xD;
      fasting conditions over a period of approximately 60 minutes at the target dose level. A&#xD;
      total of 21 blood samples will be collected in each cohort for PK analysis and a total of 14&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected in each cohort for PD analysis. A total of 6 immunogenicity&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected for ADA and NAbs. For each subject in cohort 5 &amp; 6 only, one&#xD;
      single CSF sample will be collected via lumbar puncture over the study, for PK and PD&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>NS101 IV infusion</intervention_name>
    <description>Approximately 1 hour prior to start of study drug infusion, an IV port will be inserted into the antecubital region and a sterile normal saline solution infusion will be initiated at fixed rate in order to keep the vein open. The study drug will be infused over approximately 60 minutes at a constant rate. At the end of the infusion, 3 mL of saline solution will be injected to flush the remaining drug into the IV catheter. The end of infusion will be set to the end of the 3 mL flush. For safety reason (e.g., administration of rescue medication), the IV line will remain opened for approximately 1 hour following completion of infusion.</description>
