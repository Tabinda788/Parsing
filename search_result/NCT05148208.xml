  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We perform a pilot study to investigate whether intra-dialytic creatine supplementation via&#xD;
      the dialysate will result in higher intra-erythrocyte creatine concentrations. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include changes in muscle mass, muscle strength and cognition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dialysis is a life-saving treatment, but unfortunately health-related quality of life (HRQoL)&#xD;
      of dialysis patients is poor and mortality risks are high compared to the general population.&#xD;
      Although several potentially modifiable (e.g. pre-dialysis care and nutritional status) and&#xD;
      unmodifiable risk factors (e.g. age and genetics) for excess risk of mortality and poor HRQoL&#xD;
      have been identified in dialysis-dependent patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), there&#xD;
      is great need for identification of new potentially modifiable risk factors. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that creatine deficiency is such a modifiable risk factor, which underlies several important&#xD;
      causes for impaired HRQoL hemodialysis patients, such as protein energy wasting (PEW),&#xD;
      sarcopenia, fatigue, muscle weakness, depression, cognitive impairment, and increased&#xD;
      susceptibility and a higher risk of an adverse course of infectious diseases. We propose that&#xD;
      creatine supplementation is particularly important for patients with dialysis-dependent CKD&#xD;
      because (1) endogenous synthesis of creatine in these patients is severely impaired due to&#xD;
      the virtual absence of kidney function and, consequently, the virtual absence of the first&#xD;
      enzymatic step required for endogenous absence of creatine from the amino acids arginine and&#xD;
      glycine (2) unopposed losses of creatine to the dialysis fluid during dialysis sessions, and&#xD;
      (3) inadequate intake of creatine due to advices towards a primary plant-based diet in these&#xD;
      patients. All this comes on top of the normally existing continuous non-enzymatic conversion&#xD;
      of approximately 1.6-1.7% of the endogenous creatine pool to creatinine, which necessitates&#xD;
      continuous replenishment of creatine by the combination of endogenous synthesis and dietary&#xD;
      intake to remain in steady-state. This is a novel understanding because until recently it was&#xD;
      not recognized that kidney function is an important contributor to endogenous creatine&#xD;
      synthesis, so that the capacity to of patients with dialysis-dependent CKD to maintain&#xD;
      creatine homeostasis in the light of ongoing conversion of creatine into creatinine,&#xD;
      additional unopposed losses of creatine to the dialysis fluid and an inadequate dietary&#xD;
      intake is severely impaired. Patients with dialysis-dependent CKD could benefit from creatine&#xD;
      supplementation by allowing for maintenance of their endogenous creatine pools, which would&#xD;
      help them to sustain bodily functions which depend on creatine availability, including normal&#xD;
      function of muscles, heart, the immune system and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these novel/ recent findings, we hypothesize that creatine, intradialytic creatine&#xD;
      supplementation may help to maintain creatine homeostasis among dialysis-dependent chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease patients, and consequently improve muscle status, nutritional status,&#xD;
      neurocognitive status fatigue and HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this pilot study is the feasibility of prolonged&#xD;
      intra-dialytic creatine supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this pilot study are to study the safety of prolonged&#xD;
      intra-dialytic creatine supplementation for dialysis patients and finding the optimal dosage&#xD;
      to replenish the creatine pool, to this end we will step wisely increase creatine&#xD;
      concentrations of the dialysis solution (in the range of 0.5 mM to a maximum of 2mM, with the&#xD;
      latter reflecting the concentration that can be reached after an oral bolus of creatine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective is to obtain pilot data on the effect of intradialytic creatine&#xD;
      supplementation on muscle status, nutritional status, neurocognitive status fatigue and HRQoL&#xD;
      to allow for calculation of the power for a lager intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Block-randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study in 16 hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients (which will be divided into four groups (0.5mM, 1.0mM, 1.5mM, 2.0mM) each consisting&#xD;
      of three patients receiving creatine and one receiving placebo). The total study duration is&#xD;
      8 weeks with 6 weeks of active treatment and 2 weeks of wash-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population comprises of a total of 16 adult (≥18 years)&#xD;
      clinically stable patients with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease treated by&#xD;
      conventional hemodialysis in the UMCG and the Dialysis Center Groningen Intervention:&#xD;
      Creatine will be added to the dialysis fluid and will thus be continuously administered&#xD;
      during the whole hemodialysis session. We will study the effect of four increasing dosages of&#xD;
      creatine (3 out of 4 patients per block) or placebo (1 out of 4 patients per block) in four&#xD;
      groups of four patients: 0.5mM, 1.0mM, 1.5mM, or 2.0mM of creatine. The patients will receive&#xD;
      creatine supplementation or placebo (sterile water with the same composition as the&#xD;
      dialysate) during each hemodialysis session during a total period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Creatine-monohydrate, Creapure® &quot;Pharma Quality&quot; (not GMP), produced by AlzChem Trostberg,&#xD;
      Germany will be used for preparation of a 50 mmol/L stock solution of creatine which will be&#xD;
      added to the dialysis fluid to reach the projected dialysate concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main parameters for the pilot study are the plasma&#xD;
      creatine concentration and intra-erythrocytic creatine concentration of both pre- and&#xD;
      post-hemodialysis samples. Intra-erythrocytic creatine concentration will be used as a&#xD;
      non-invasive proxy for creatine tissue uptake. Secondary study parameters are hand grip&#xD;
      strength as a measure of muscle strength, the combined interdialytic urinary and&#xD;
      intradialytic dialysate excretion of creatinine as a measure of muscle mass, and&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a measure of body composition and nutritional&#xD;
      status. Other study parameters are N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) as a&#xD;
      cardiac function marker, high sensitivity troponin T (hs-TNT) as a cardiac ischaemia marker,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein as an inflammation marker, self-reported physical health using the EQ-6D,&#xD;
      SF36, and the DSI, fatigue using the CIS and cognitive functions using the CFQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: For this study, during each of study visits (baseline, week 3, week 6, and after&#xD;
      a wash-out period of 2 weeks) patients will have to stay at the dialysis unit for 45 minutes&#xD;
      longer than usual for their regular HD treatment. Besides arterial blood sampling (from the&#xD;
      dialysis line) no venepunctures are necessary. For each study visit the total blood volume&#xD;
      will not exceed 152 ml. Participants with a residual diuresis of ≥ 200 ml per 24h are asked&#xD;
      to collect interdialytic urine. During the hemodialysis session, the complete dialysate&#xD;
      volume will be collected in a tank. Dialysate is considered a 'waste product' and the&#xD;
      collection of dialysate is no burden for the patient. Questionnaires can be filled in during&#xD;
      the hemodialysis session. None of the health tests performed as part of this study cause&#xD;
      physical discomfort. To minimize any risk of falling, physical tests are performed prior to&#xD;
      the dialysis session and under the supervision of an investigator. We believe it is justified&#xD;
      to perform the proposed study in order to elucidate the possible effects of intra-dialytic&#xD;
      creatine supplementation on e.g. muscle status, nutritional status, neurocognitive status&#xD;
      fatigue in hemodialysis patients. The finding of a beneficial effect will improve HRQoL and&#xD;
      mortality rates.&#xD;
