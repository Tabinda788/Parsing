  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Baobab fruits have been traditionally used in Africa due to its therapeutic proprieties&#xD;
      attributed to it high polyphenol content. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of baobab fruit on postprandial glycaemia on healthy adults and to measure its bioactive&#xD;
      compounds and antioxidant activity. The study was conducted on 31 healthy subjects. The&#xD;
      participants were randomly allocated in control group (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); n&#xD;
      = 16) and in intervention group (OGTT followed by administration of 250 ml baobab aqueous&#xD;
      extract (BAE); n = 15). Total phenols, proanthocyanidins, hydrolysable tannins and&#xD;
      antioxidant activity (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS and inhibition of O2•- and NO• methods) were&#xD;
      quantified. Repeated Measures ANOVA of mixed type and Independent samples t-test were used.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was approved by Egas Moniz Cooperativa de Ensino Superior Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (protocol code 518) and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (Declaration of 1975, revised in 2000). An informed consent was given to all eligible&#xD;
      participants, after oral and written information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled clinical trial, blind to subjects, was conducted with 31 subjects,&#xD;
      recruited at the Campus Universitário Egas Moniz, in Monte de Caparica, Portugal. After&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and inform consent signed, participants were subjected to the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria and subsequently randomly allocated in to control or intervention&#xD;
      groups. The method of allocation sequence was based on sequentially numbers. The first&#xD;
      patient was randomly assigned to intervention or control group, and the following patients&#xD;
      were sequentially allocated alternately to each group. A codification was attributed to each&#xD;
      participant in order to maintained anonymity and ensure confidentiality of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a period of 8-10 hours fasting, the control group was given OGTT and the intervention&#xD;
      group was given OGTT followed by baobab aqueous extract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baobab aqueous extract preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baobab fruit was bought in the market of Benfica, located in the city of Luanda (Angola)&#xD;
      and brought to Lisbon (Portugal) duly packed in a plastic bag and stored in a dried&#xD;
      environmental local until needed. For the aqueous extraction of the fruit 40 ± 1 g of pulp,&#xD;
      seeds and red filaments were weighed and the fruit was boiled in 300 ml of water for 5&#xD;
      minutes. After slowly cooling until room temperature, extract was then placed in a&#xD;
      refrigerator in a container where it remained for 8 hours at an average temperature of 10°C.&#xD;
      The BAE was sieved with the aid of a net sieve, separating it from the seeds and filaments,&#xD;
      and was subsequently subjected to the clinical trial and the antioxidant assays. For the&#xD;
      antioxidant assays, after filtration, the extract was passed through the blender (Kenwood&#xD;
      Multipro Compact Food Processor FDP302SI), filtered again obtaining homogeneous samples,&#xD;
      avoiding the formation of precipitates during the analysis. Final concentration of the&#xD;
      aqueous extract obtained, for both clinical trial and chemical analysis, was 0.1333 g&#xD;
      Adansonia digitata L. (AD) / ml extract fresh weight (FW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After overnight fasting, blood glucose level was assessed through a capillary drop blood,&#xD;
      immediately before Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (t0). The control group participants ingested&#xD;
      glucose solution alone (OGTT) prepared with 75 g of anhydrous oral glucose as prescribed by&#xD;
      the American Dietetic Association (ADA), dissolved in 200 ml of water. The intervention group&#xD;
      ingested glucose solution followed by 250 ml of baobab aqueous extract (33.33 g FW). Blood&#xD;
      glucose level was also measured at 30 (t30), 60 (t60), 90 (t90) and 120 (t120) minutes&#xD;
      immediately after intervention, for each participant, in control and intervention groups.&#xD;
      Glucometer equipment, strips for glucose meters (One Touch Select Plus) and sterilized&#xD;
      lancets (Sarstedt normal 21G) were used to measure blood glucose concentrations, taking due&#xD;
      care of safety and asepsis. Based on the glycaemia values, the blood glucose incremental area&#xD;
      under the curve (AUCi) of each participant was defined using the GraphPad Prism program&#xD;
      (version 5.0). Maximum concentrations (Cmax) and variations of maximum concentrations (ΔCmax)&#xD;
      were determined by comparing them with their respective baseline glycemia levels values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anthropometric parameters were also collected, namely, weight, height and body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI). The BMI was calculated as weight (Kg) divided by height (m2) squared (Kg/m2). Body&#xD;
      weight was estimated by bio-impedance, through scale the Inbody®, model 230.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary ingestion assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the study completed a 24-hour food recall questionnaire, which were carefully&#xD;
      instructed by an investigator to identify all food consumed. The amount of each food ingested&#xD;
      was estimated with help from pictures. A book with pictures of meals in different sizes was&#xD;
      used. The investigator reviewed the questionnaire together with the participant. Food intake&#xD;
      of each participant was analysed using the software The Food Processor SQL (version 11.3.285)&#xD;
      obtaining total energy, carbohydrates, proteins and lipids mean intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total phenol, proanthocyanidins and hydrolysable tannins content assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total phenolic concentration was determined according to the Folin Ciocalteu method employing&#xD;
      gallic acid as standard. Results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents/L (GAE/L).&#xD;
      For this analysis, 125 μl of BAE, previously diluted (x15) in water and 125 μl of ethanol was&#xD;
      added to 2.5 ml of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent solution (1:10 diluted in H2O) and 2 ml of aqueous&#xD;
      sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) 1M. After 15 minutes the absorbance was measured at 765 nm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content of proanthocyanidins was determined according to Gu et al (2002) method with&#xD;
      modifications, which is based on acidic hydrolysis of proanthocyanidins polymers producing&#xD;
      reddish pigments in hot 1-butanol/ hydrochloric acid solution. It was added 200 μl of BAE&#xD;
      diluted (x2) to 200 μl of methanol and 2600 μl of HCl /1-butanol 10%(v/v) solution. The test&#xD;
      tubes were shaken and incubated, at 100°C for 50 minutes. The absorbance was measured at 550&#xD;
      nm. Results are expressed as mg equivalents of proanthocyanidins A2 /L (EPA2/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of Willis and Allen was adapted for the determination of hydrolysable tannins of&#xD;
      the BAE. A volume of 1 ml of extract was added to 5 ml of 2.5% potassium iodate (KIO3). The&#xD;
      mixture was then stirred and returned to the water bath at 25°C for 20 minutes. Absorbance&#xD;
      reading was performed by a spectrophotometer at 550 nm and the results were expressed as mg&#xD;
      of tannic acid equivalents/L (TAE/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antioxidant assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) method: the antioxidant effect (reducing ability)&#xD;
      was evaluated by monitoring the formation of an intense blue color from the Fe2+ TPTZ&#xD;
      complex, according to the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assay. A volume of 2850µl&#xD;
      (25ml 300mM acetate buffer pH=3,6 solution plus 2,5 ml 10mM TPTZ solution in HCl 40mM + 2,5&#xD;
      ml 20mM FeCl3.6H2O solution) was added to 150µl of diluted BAE.. The tubes were kept in the&#xD;
      dark for 30 minutes (7 assays at different concentrations). The absorbance was determined at&#xD;
      593 nm and the results were expressed in mg of Trolox equivalents/L (TE/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABTS method: this method was based on the capacity of a sample to inhibit the ABTS radical&#xD;
      (ABTS+) compared with a reference antioxidant standard (Trolox). The ABTS+ radical was&#xD;
      generated by chemical reaction with potassium persulfate (K2S2O8). Thus, 25 ml of ABTS (7 mM)&#xD;
      was added to 440 µl of K2S2O8 (140 mM) and allowed to stand in darkness at room temperature&#xD;
      for 12-16 h. The solution was prepared by taking a volume of the previous solution and&#xD;
      diluting it in ethanol until its absorbance at λ = 734 nm was 0.70. The tubes were kept in&#xD;
      the dark for 30 minutes. The results expressed in mg of Trolox equivalents/L (TE/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DPPH method: this method was determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical&#xD;
      scavenger. A volume of 150 μl BAE was added to 2850 μl of DPPH solution previously prepared&#xD;
      in methanol with a λ=515 nm of 1.1. The solutions were kept for 24 hours in the absence of&#xD;
      light. The absorbance was determined at 515 nm and the results expressed in mg of Trolox&#xD;
      equivalents/L (TE/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition capacity of O2•- anion and NO radical:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superoxide anion is generated by oxidation of NADH by reacting with PMS and oxygen,&#xD;
      causing the reduction of NBT. A volume of 500 μl of BAE with different concentration were&#xD;
      added to 2 ml of NADH (189μM) and NBT (120 μM) in 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8. The reaction&#xD;
      was started after the addition of 0.5 ml of PMS (60 μM) and after 5 minutes incubation at&#xD;
      room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 560 nm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inhibition NO radical test was based on the method of Nikkhah and coworkers (2008). A&#xD;
      volume of 250 μl of BAE with different concentrations was added to 1 ml of sodium&#xD;
      nitroprusside and 250 μl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The mixture was kept for 150&#xD;
      minutes at 25°C. Then, 0.5 ml of this mixture was added to 1 ml of sulfanilic acid (0.33% in&#xD;
      20% glacial acetic acid), and kept for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then it was added 1 ml&#xD;
      of NED (0.1% w/v) and kept this mixture for 30 minutes at 25°C. At the end of the reaction a&#xD;
      pink chromophore was formed. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The percentage of&#xD;
      inhibition of O2•- and NO radicals was determined using equation 1 and the results were&#xD;
      expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using the Excel® and SPSS® (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences) version 27.0 software for Mac. Data are presented as mean ± SD (standard deviation)&#xD;
      and SEM (standard error of the mean). Repeated measurement ANOVA of mixed type was used to&#xD;
      assess the difference between the 2 groups for postprandial blood glucose at different times.&#xD;
      The independent samples t-test was used to assess the difference between the 2 groups for&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters, total energy intake, carbohydrates, protein and lipid, Cmax, ΔCmax&#xD;
      and AUCi values. All statistical tests were performed at the 5% level of significance.&#xD;
