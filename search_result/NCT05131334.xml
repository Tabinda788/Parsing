      Background: The cause of the vegetative symptoms is a sympathetic driven misbalance of the&#xD;
      autonomous nervous system. To restore vegetative balance in alcohol withdrawal syndrome new&#xD;
      neuro-modulatory methods, such as percutaneous auricular vagal stimulation (pVNS) could be&#xD;
      used. Measuring the pupil size is a suitable method to assess imbalances or dysfunctions of&#xD;
      the vegetative regulation in individuals. Objective: The objective of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the pupil reaction to the cholinergic antagonist tropicamide in alcohol withdrawal syndrome&#xD;
      as a biomarker of the vegetative balance before and after pVNS. Methods: 30 patients aged&#xD;
      between 20 and 65 were recruited in this open-label, controlled pilot trial with repeated&#xD;
      measure design. pVNS was administered at the left cymba conchae for 72 hours with intermitted&#xD;
      stimulation. Pupillometric recording lasted about 60 min and was performed at baseline and&#xD;
      following pVNS. The reaction of the pupil to an anticholinergic agent was measured as a&#xD;
      receptor-test in terms of a psychophysiological feedback mechanism to pVNS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The chronic consumption of alcohol leads to a pathophysiological adaptation of the nervous&#xD;
      system, by an increase in glutamatergic receptors and a decrease in GABAergic receptor&#xD;
      functions. Autonomic and psychomotor hyperactive disorders, such as nausea, tremor,&#xD;
      diaphoresis, hypersensitive reflexes, hypertension, and tachycardia, as well as negative&#xD;
      emotional states, characterized by restlessness, anxiety, dysphoria, and irritability occur 6&#xD;
      to 24 hours after cessation of alcohol consumption. The cause of the vegetative symptoms is a&#xD;
      sympathetic driven misbalance of the autonomous nervous system. The negative state of health&#xD;
      can last for a very long time and is the main reason for relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome consists of ether Benzodiazepines or&#xD;
      GHB is an endogenous metabolite of Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of successful treatment is lowest for alcohol dependence among all psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. Therefore, it seems important to carry out further interdisciplinary&#xD;
      investigations in the direction of new and effective treatment methods. To restore vegetative&#xD;
      balance in alcohol-withdrawal syndrome novel neuromodulatory approaches, such percutaneous&#xD;
      auricular vagal stimulation (pVNS) could be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pupil size changes, like other physiological markers, e.g., hyperventilation, blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate, serves as psychophysiological marker of the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      (ANS). Beside the fact that pupil size is determined by balance between the parasympathetic&#xD;
      ANS (PANS) and the sympathetic ANS (SANS), measuring the static and dynamic pupillary&#xD;
      diameters are suitable parameters measuring imbalances or dysfunction of the vegetative&#xD;
      regulation. The pupil diameter oscillates spontaneously at low frequencies, which is an&#xD;
      almost constant oscillatory change in the pupil size. Like pupil size, it is generally&#xD;
      assumed that pupil oscillation is regulated by a dynamic interaction between parasympathetic&#xD;
      (cholinergic) and sympathetic (noradrenergic) activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigator assessed the pupil reaction to the cholinergic antagonist&#xD;
      tropicamide in alcohol withdrawal syndrome as a biomarker of the vegetative balance before&#xD;
      and after pVNS. The Investigator hypothesized that pVNS will enhance the parasympathomimetic&#xD;
      tone represented by a reduction of pupillary diameter in a parasympatholytic pharmacological&#xD;
      challenge with tropicamide after vagal stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study applied an open-label, unblinded, repeated measures design with three time&#xD;
      points of pupillometry measurements at two testing days. For baseline measurements, the&#xD;
      static pupil measurement was taken with the head fixed in a position and with open eyes (0').&#xD;
      Followed by an administration one drop of 0.01% tropicamide-solution into the left eye. The&#xD;
      dynamic pupil measure followed 20 minutes (20') and 40 minutes (40') after tropicamide&#xD;
      application. In our protocol the investigator scheduled a 60' measurement, which was removed&#xD;
      due to the finding, that a maximum dilation was measured after 40' and that patients became&#xD;
      increasingly agitated and weary, often leading to biased recordings at baseline measurement.&#xD;
      Absolute change (mm), and relative change (%) of the pupil diameter was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, auriStim (AU0115, Multisana GmbH, Vienna, Austria) was placed for percutaneous vagal&#xD;
      stimulation (pVNS). Patients were stimulated for 72 hours, with an intermittent stimulation&#xD;
      mode, switching from active to resting state all three hours. After the stimulation period,&#xD;
      patients placed their head in a fixed position for the second pupil measurement. For dynamic&#xD;
      measurements, tropicamide was induced and measures were taken after 20' and 40'. Again, the&#xD;
      investigator calculated absolute and relative changes of the pupil diameter. For each&#xD;
      recording the investigator analyzed pupillary oscillations with a Fourier analysis as&#xD;
      biomarker of the central nervous activation. All patients were tested at the same time of the&#xD;
      day (between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m.) to exclude diurnal variation in pupillary diameter at day&#xD;
      two and day five of the inpatient alcohol withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (pVNS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For auricular vagal stimulation the investigator used auriStim (AU0115, Multisana GmbH,&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria). Using a green light-emitting diode (LEDs) flashlight, blood vessels in the&#xD;
      cymba conchae of the left ear side were detected. Minimal invasive needles (penetrating&#xD;
      1-2mm) were placed close to the vessel-bifurcation to provide efficient stimulation of the&#xD;
      auricular branch of the vagus nerve. The built-in microchip controls monophasic volt pulses&#xD;
      of 1 ms, with alternating polarity, a frequency of 1 Hz and an amplitude of 4V. Stimulation&#xD;
      lasted for 72h in total with alternating on/off periods of three hours. Thereafter, the&#xD;
      device was removed, and patients continued their therapy consisting of anti-withdrawal&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative pupillometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before recording, patients were acquainted to the test environment (160 lux) in a&#xD;
      noise-protected room (3 x 4 meters) for three minutes. With head held steady in a chin- and&#xD;
      forehead rest, the patients positioned their left eye in front of the camera and fixed a&#xD;
      black dot, at 1.6m distance, to prevent accommodation. Pupillometry was performed using a&#xD;
      non-invasive, personal computer-based infrared digital video pupillometer system (TV&#xD;
      pupillometer 1050, Whittaker Corporation., California, Los Angeles). Incorporated five&#xD;
      milliwatts, infra-red LEDs provide continuous illumination of the eye, with a wavelength of&#xD;
      850nm to achieve high contrast filming condition, and to which the pupil does not respond.&#xD;
      The system integrates a calibrated light stimulation of fixed intensity (145 lux) and&#xD;
      duration (300ms) to induce a light-evoked pupillary reaction. The system allows a precise&#xD;
      (0.01mm limit) and rapid (50Hz) measure of the vertical diameter, and automatically&#xD;
      determines static pupil size (averaged over the first 25.6sec of recording) and a series of&#xD;
      dynamic pupillary parameters after light stimulation. Dynamic parameters include resting&#xD;
      pupil diameter (pupil diameter just before light-stimulation), the latency for constriction&#xD;
      (the latency time from the light flash exposure to the start of pupillary constriction), the&#xD;
      amplitude of constriction (the value of the resting diameter minus the maximum constriction&#xD;
      diameter), the constrictive ratio (amplitude of constriction/resting pupil diameter), the&#xD;
      duration of constriction (time interval between the start of constriction, and the time point&#xD;
      of maximum constriction) and peak constriction velocity. The recording of the pupillary&#xD;
      diameter and response curve is shown as a graph of the pupillary diameter against time. Based&#xD;
      on the measurement of static pupillary diameter (first 25.6sec) the pupillometer calculates&#xD;
      pupillary oscillations by Fourier analysis (FA), reflecting the activation of the central&#xD;
      nervous system. Prior to Fourier Analysis a linear interpolation was applied to artefacts&#xD;
      such as blinking and missing data by a built-in noise removal program. For FA the&#xD;
      investigator used five individual frequency bands: 0.0 - 0.2, 0.21 - 0.4, 0.41 - 0-6, 0.61 -&#xD;
      0.8, 0.81 - 1 Hz and whole power spectrum 0.0 - 1 Hz.&#xD;
