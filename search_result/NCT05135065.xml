  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to reduce disparities in care among disadvantaged racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minority adolescents with ADHD by improving community therapist fidelity to evidence-based&#xD;
      behavior therapy through a technology-assisted supervision intervention. In Y01, the research&#xD;
      team will work with stakeholders to develop the proposed supervision intervention utilizing&#xD;
      two novel technologies: Lyssn + Care4 (LC4S). In Y02, a preliminary clinical trial (N=72)&#xD;
      will be conducted in three community mental health agencies in Miami, FL. Adolescent&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive supervision from a therapist who is trained&#xD;
      in LCS4 or provides enhanced supervision as usual(ESAU)using a permuted block randomization&#xD;
      strategy that randomizes within site. There will also be double randomization of agency&#xD;
      therapists to supervisors. Supervisors will deliver both conditions and investigators will&#xD;
      test for contamination to determine the integrity of this design prior to a future R01 that&#xD;
      measures patient outcomes. Data from therapists, adolescents and their parents, and&#xD;
      supervisors will be collected pre-training, post-training, weekly during service delivery, at&#xD;
      EBT completion, and at the end of the trial. The proximal intervention target is therapist&#xD;
      fidelity to EBT and the distal targets are service delivery outcomes that include quality,&#xD;
      quantity, and speed of delivery. Investigators will also measure indices of consumer fit:&#xD;
      cost, acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity to supervision procedures. Sources of data&#xD;
      will be audio recorded therapy and supervision sessions, therapist and supervisor report, and&#xD;
      project and electronic health records. In longitudinal analyses, time will be modeled as a&#xD;
      person-specific variable representing months since baseline. Investigators will nest&#xD;
      adolescents within therapists for all analyses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Y02 of this study is a small (N=72) phase 1/phase 2 clinical trial of a supervision&#xD;
      intervention designed to improve therapist treatment fidelity and subsequent service delivery&#xD;
      outcomes. The parallel design includes random assignment of eligible and consenting patients&#xD;
      at three community agencies to two active supervision intervention arms (LC4S or ESAU) using&#xD;
      a permuted block randomization strategy that accounts for agency. Participants will receive&#xD;
      behavioral interventions from community agency staff and their service utilization will be&#xD;
      tracked using project and agency electronic health records. Agency therapists and supervisors&#xD;
      will also be participants in this trial. Therapists will be randomized to receive either LC4S&#xD;
      or ESAU from their supervisor (double randomization) using a block randomization strategy&#xD;
      that accounts for site. Supervisors will administer both supervision conditions in this&#xD;
      trial; however, investigators will systematically assess for contamination to assess whether&#xD;
      this design is appropriate for a future R01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize bias, adolescent and parent participants will not be informed of the group to&#xD;
      which they have been assigned. However, full masking of therapists and supervisors is not&#xD;
      feasible in this trial because both supervisors and therapists will know whether they are&#xD;
      participating in technology-assisted supervision activities or standard supervision&#xD;
      activities due to the nature of these conditions. However, the primary investigator will&#xD;
      blind therapists and supervisors to our study hypotheses and the nature of outcome measures&#xD;
      to minimize bias in the trial. Many of these measures will be observational and objective&#xD;
      (i.e., therapy records, therapy audio recordings), which should reduce bias stemming from&#xD;
      self-reports. Investigators will also assess whether there are group effects on therapist&#xD;
      accuracy of self-report. All interventions will be delivered by agency staff, who will not be&#xD;
      required to follow intervention delivery protocols because an outcome of this study is the&#xD;
      extent to which agency therapists follow intervention procedures with guidance provided from&#xD;
      their supervisors. Study assessments will be administered electronically via Care4 and data&#xD;
      collection will be oversee by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each measure of fidelity will be analyzed using a separate mixed /growth model (Duncan et&#xD;
      al., 1999). In this design, treatment sessions (level 1) are nested within adolescents (level&#xD;
      2), which are nested within therapists (level 3). Each adolescent attends up to 10 sessions;&#xD;
      each therapist treats 3 adolescents. Supervisors serve as an additional higher level, but&#xD;
      with so few supervisors (approximately 6), this will be addressed by including dummy&#xD;
      predictor variables representing the supervisors. The direct effect of LC4S vs. ESAU on&#xD;
      fidelity intercept and slope will be tested for each fidelity outcome (see Table 3). With&#xD;
      time centered at the first session, the intercept reflects initial fidelity for the ESAU&#xD;
      condition, the group effect reflects the initial fidelity difference between ESAU and LC4S,&#xD;
      the time effect reflects the linear change in fidelity over time for the ESAU condition, and&#xD;
      the interaction of time and group reflects the difference between ESAU and LC4S in linear&#xD;
      change in fidelity over time. As part of the R34, in will estimate the intraclass correlation&#xD;
      (ICC) and design effect for the clustering effect of therapist and supervisor on outcome to&#xD;
      determine the extent to which additional clustering will be needed in a future R01. ICC&#xD;
      ranges from 0 to 1, with larger values reflecting a larger proportion of variance at the&#xD;
      higher levels (here, therapist and supervisor rather than adolescent). Investigators will&#xD;
      also test both linear and non-linear slopes to ascertain the expected shape of the LGCA in a&#xD;
      future R01. Time to therapist MI competence, proportion of EBT delivered by 10th session, and&#xD;
      number of sessions and days to completion of the EBT will be modeled using regression&#xD;
      (linear, logistic, or Poisson depending on the distribution of the resulting variables) with&#xD;
      group as a predictor. Accuracy of therapist self-report will be analyzed using polynomial&#xD;
      regression (Laird &amp; LaFleur, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the R package powerlmm, investigators have an estimate of .8 power to detect large&#xD;
      effects (d = 0.8) representing group differences at the adolescent (level 2) level;&#xD;
      investigators have .4 power to detect medium effects (d = .5) representing group differences&#xD;
      at the adolescent level. Our hypotheses, however, are primarily at the level of the therapist&#xD;
      (level 3), which has fewer units (i.e., 12 therapists per condition versus 36 adolescents per&#xD;
      condition). As such, measures of both adolescent-level and therapist-level effects will be&#xD;
      estimated. For power for the ICC calculation, investigators used the ICC.Sample.Size R&#xD;
      package based on Zou (2012). With a sample size of 72 participants, 10 observations per&#xD;
      participant, alpha equal to .05, and a two tailed test, investigators have greater than .9&#xD;
      power detect an ICC of 0.2. ICC values for cross-sectional data such as children within&#xD;
      classrooms are approximately 0.2 (Hedges &amp; Hedberg, 2007). Investigators expect excellent&#xD;
      precision for estimating ICC values in this study.&#xD;
