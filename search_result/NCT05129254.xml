  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a laser and&#xD;
      topically applied platelet-rich plasma vs. platelet rich plasma injection in the treatment of&#xD;
      male-pattern hair loss. Participating subjects will receive up to four (4) monthly treatments&#xD;
      and will have a 12 month follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, open-label, baseline-controlled, prospective study evaluating&#xD;
      the use of a non-ablative fractionated thulium laser and topical autologous platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma (PRP) vs. PRP injection for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia (MAA). Given&#xD;
      that this is a feasibility study, the investigators do provide formal sample size&#xD;
      calculations. The findings of the study will inform that effect size associated with the&#xD;
      treatment under study, which will inform the sample size (and power) calculations of a full,&#xD;
      large-scale study. For this feasibility study, the investigators conservatively estimated the&#xD;
      number of eligible patients that can reasonably enroll in the study time frame. Over the&#xD;
      course of 1 year, the investigators typically see 50 patients with this condition annually.&#xD;
      Of those, the investigators anticipate 25-50% would be eligible and agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Given this, the investigators reasonably believe the enrollment will be 12 male&#xD;
      subjects, â‰¥ 18 years of age at time of signed informed consent, of whom 6 will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive laser + topical PRP and 6 to receive PRP injection. Follow-up visits are planned&#xD;
      for months 7, 10, 13, and 16. Standardized photography, hair density measurement of the&#xD;
      treated scalp areas will be recorded Pre and Post Treatment at each visit. Measurement&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared to baseline. During the initial visit, subjects who meet the&#xD;
      study's eligibility criteria will receive the first treatment after signing informed consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>To compare the efficacy of laser to improve delivery of topical platelet rich plasma (PRP) to promote hair growth, the investigators will employ a randomized, unblinded, baseline-controlled study design. There will be two parallel treatment arms in the study. The first arm will enroll six participants to receive thulium laser and topical PRP. The second arm will enroll six participants to receive PRP injection alone. Total participants enrolled will be twelve (12). There will be a total of 8 study visits (4 treatment and 4 follow-up) lasting 16 months.&#xD;
Each participant will receive an initial series of 4 treatments, either laser + topical PRP or PRP injection alone once a month for the first 4 months (month 1, 2, 3, 4). Thereafter, patients will be followed at 3-month intervals at month 7, 10, 13, and 16.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale for Pain is an 11-point scale scored from 0-10, with 0 = no pain, 5 = moderate pain, and 10 = worst possible pain. Subjects select a value that is most in line with the intensity of their pain experienced during and after treatment with Thulium Laser and topical platelet rich plasma or platelet rich plasma injection. The NRS pain questionnaire will be given to participants to complete for each treatment for the first 4 months of the study.</description>

    <intervention_name>Fractionated Thulium laser</intervention_name>
    <description>For this study, the investigators will use non-ablative fractional Thulium laser (1927 nm), provided by LaseMD, (Lutronic, Inc, USA). The non-ablative fractionated treatments with minimal downtime provide synergistic benefit of minimizing tissue damage while improving treatment tolerance and efficiency. The laser works by creating micro-channels in the dermis of the pilosebaceous unit, while leaving bridges of untouched tissue for improved permeability, faster healing, and enhanced delivery of topical treatments. The parameters of the laser will be set according to optimal operation protocol and in accordance with guidelines set forth by LaseMD. More than one affected area of the scalp may be treated per session. Each laser treatment will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes per subject. Pretreatment preparation will consist of cleaning the affected area of the scalp with antiseptic, either 70% ethanol or 3% hydrogen peroxide.</description>
