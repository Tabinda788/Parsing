  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross sectional observational study to asses the performance of two novel HBV DNA&#xD;
      testing methodologies; a) dried blood spot sampling and b) fingerstick capillary blood using&#xD;
      the Xpert® Hepatitis B Virus viral load assay. Both novel testing methodologies will be&#xD;
      compared with venous blood tested using a gold standard HBV DNA assay. The sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the two novel testing will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBV viral load tests are essential to guide antiviral treatment eligibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness. However, many people are unable to access these tests, particularly those&#xD;
      living in remote or limited resources settings given high cost, or unavailable&#xD;
      infrastructure. Simple, affordable and accessible HBV viral load tests are required to&#xD;
      increase global access to HBV testing and treatment to meet the WHO HBV elimination targets.&#xD;
      The GeneXpert Diagnostic Systems, the most common molecular point-of-care platform globally,&#xD;
      has the potential to provide simple and affordable HBV viral load tests. Dried Blood Spot&#xD;
      testing is also an affordable and accessible testing methodology particularly suited to&#xD;
      remote and resource limited settings. This proof-of-concept study will assess the feasibility&#xD;
      and diagnostic performance of Xpert® HBV Viral Load test and Dried Blood Spot testing for the&#xD;
      quantitation of HBV DNA from fingerstick capillary samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a cross-sectional observational study and will assess the performance of a&#xD;
      novel fingerstick HBV Viral Load and Dried Blood Spot tests within a total of 300&#xD;
      participants who will be recruited across a network of hepatitis clinics in Sydney,&#xD;
      Australia. No treatment will be administered as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Xpert HBV cartridge will be adapted to use fingerstick capillary blood instead of&#xD;
      processed whole blood, and it's performance measured against a gold standard venous blood HBV&#xD;
      DNA assay. Dried Blood Spot HBV DNA testing performance will also be measured against the&#xD;
      gold standard venous blood HBV DNA assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to: 1) evaluate diagnostic performance of the Xpert®&#xD;
      HBV Viral Load assay compared to standard of care testing, by patients' hepatitis B e-antigen&#xD;
      status (among e-antigen positive and e-antigen negative patients). 2) Evaluate diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of the Xpert® HBV Viral Load assay compared to standard of care testing, by HBV&#xD;
      treatment status (among treatment naïve patients and those receiving treatment). 3) Evaluate&#xD;
      diagnostic performance of the Xpert® HBV Viral Load assay compared to standard of care&#xD;
      testing, by HBV DNA levels (among patients with HBV DNA &lt;20 IU/mL; between 20 and 2,000&#xD;
      IU/mL, between 2,000 and 20,000 IU/mL; between 20,000 and 200,000 IU/mL; and &gt;200,000 IU/mL).&#xD;

    <description>300 patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B will be enrolled. A fingerstick HBV DNA test will be performed using the Xpert HBV Viral Load assay, and a dried blood spot sample will be collected which will be tested using a gold standard HBV DNA viral load assay.
