      The objective of the DISTALS Study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Tigertriever 13 Revascularization Device in restoring blood flow in the neurovasculature by&#xD;
      removing thrombus in patients presenting within 24 hours of onset with an ischemic stroke&#xD;
      with disabling neurological deficits due to a primary distal vessel occlusion (DVO), as&#xD;
      compared to medical management.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Disabling presenting deficits that localize to the territory of the distal vessel&#xD;
             occlusion. Disabling deficits are deficits that, if unchanged, would prevent the&#xD;
             subject from performing basic activities of daily living (i.e., bathing, ambulating,&#xD;
             toileting, hygiene, and eating) or returning to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. NIHSS 4-24, or NIHSS 2-24 for patients with aphasia and/or hemianopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Perfusion lesion (Tmax &gt;4.0 seconds) volume ≥10 cc on CTP or MR PWI within the&#xD;
             territory of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) segments, a non-dominant or&#xD;
             co-dominant M2 middle cerebral artery (MCA) segment, an M3 MCA, or the posterior&#xD;
             cerebral artery (PCA) segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Occluded distal vessel diameter ≥1.5 mm as measured on CTA or MRA.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Subject is not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis within 3 hours from stroke onset&#xD;
             per FDA label and American Heart Association/American Stroke Association national&#xD;
             guidelines. (Note: administration of intravenous thrombolytics should not be avoided&#xD;
             or delayed in order to achieve participation in this study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of acute brain hemorrhage on CT and/or MRI at admission.&#xD;
