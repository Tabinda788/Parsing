      Mask use in public settings is recommended to limit the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the disease known as COVID-19 and endorsed by&#xD;
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;
      Wearing a mask during exercise may have implications for recreational exercisers and athletes&#xD;
      that train and compete at a high exercise intensities as it has been shown to limit&#xD;
      ventilation (VE) and increase end-tidal CO2 compared to a no-mask control. For example, N95&#xD;
      masks are designed to fit more tightly around the nose and mouth than other types of masks&#xD;
      and have been shown to reduce markers of maximal exercise performance compared to a no-mask&#xD;
      control for individuals performing an incremental ramp protocol on a cycle ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to N95 masks being reserved for health care workers, surgical masks certified by&#xD;
      National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are easily accessible to wear during&#xD;
      exercise to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread. Indeed, these masks fit more loosely than the&#xD;
      N95, but did not reduce maximal power (Pmax), relative oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min), or&#xD;
      test duration in two studies where participants performed a progressive maximal exercise test&#xD;
      on a cycle ergometer. Further, surgical mask use during a progressive maximal cycling&#xD;
      exercise protocol did not change cardiovascular, metabolic, and pulmonary measurements when&#xD;
      compared to a no-mask condition in healthy individuals, with the exception of a decrease in&#xD;
      maximal heart rate (HRmax). Another recent study using a progressive maximal cycling exercise&#xD;
      protocol showed no change in (HRmax) using cycle ergometry when surgical mask use was&#xD;
      compared to a no-mask condition. While this type of progressive maximal exercise test is&#xD;
      frequently used for clinical and laboratory settings to assess cardiovascular, pulmonary, and&#xD;
      metabolic markers, this type of exercise protocol is not often employed by athletes seeking&#xD;
      to improve performance or recreational exercisers taking action to improve fitness. Because&#xD;
      this exercise protocol is not used by athletes or recreational exercisers to train, it is&#xD;
      difficult to translate the results of mask use during progressive maximal exercise tests to&#xD;
      commonly practiced forms of exercise. In fact, a recent meta-analysis concludes that wearing&#xD;
      a mask elicits a minimal impact on cardiovascular, respiratory, or metabolic variables across&#xD;
      a wide array of exercise intensities and modalities, however, high intensity interval&#xD;
      exercise (HIIE) was not included in this analysis, nor were hot environmental temperatures.&#xD;
      Thus, the physiologic or metabolic responses while wearing a medical-grade surgical mask are&#xD;
      not yet known with HIIE in both temperate and hot environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High intensity interval exercise is a popular time-efficient training method that involves&#xD;
      short high intensity bouts followed by either active (low/moderate intensity exercise) or&#xD;
      passive (no exercise) rest bouts. High intensity interval exercise has been shown to be a&#xD;
      safe and effective way to increase physical fitness or performance in a diverse population&#xD;
      that include exercisers in recreational, competitive, and clinical settings. Further, as HIIE&#xD;
      can be performed in either an indoor or outdoor environment and using a mask may increase the&#xD;
      physiological and perceptual strain of the exercise depending on the temperature and&#xD;
      humidity. In a hot environment (40°C and 20% humidity), no difference was found in skin&#xD;
      temperature under or outside a KN95 mask in healthy males that performed 45-minutes of&#xD;
      moderate intensity physical activity that mimicked movements required in occupational&#xD;
      settings. Also, no difference was found in whole body thermal discomfort, and an increase in&#xD;
      perceived breathlessness by 36% was observed. In addition, surgical mask use during 30&#xD;
      minutes of mild uphill treadmill exercise did not increase risk of heat stroke in a hot and&#xD;
      humid environment. To date, no research study has investigated the effects of surgical mask&#xD;
      use during HIIE in different environmental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of surgical mask use&#xD;
      during HIIE on cardiovascular, metabolic, thermoregulatory, and perceptual responses in&#xD;
      temperate and hot environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodsː In a randomized fashion, ten healthy participants completed two HIIE sessions in a&#xD;
      36°C hot (HIIE-HOT) and two HIIE sessions in a 23°C temperate environment (HIIE-TEMP) while&#xD;
      wearing (MASK) and not wearing a surgical mask (CON).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Anthropometrics and maximal Oxygen uptake measurements Before the experimental&#xD;
      trials, participants visited the Exercise Physiology laboratories for anthropometrics and&#xD;
      VO2max measurement. Body height was measured using a stadiometer (SECA, seca 216, Chino, CA,&#xD;
      USA) and weight was measured using a digital scale (Cardinal DETECTO 758C, Webb City, MO).&#xD;
      Then, participants completed a 5-minute warm-up at a self-selected exercise intensity prior&#xD;
      to the VO2max test on an electrically braked cycle ergometer (Lode, Excalibur Sport,&#xD;
      Groningen, The Netherlands). During the VO2max test, HR was measured using a Polar HR monitor&#xD;
      (Polar, Polar H10, USA) with each test designed to last between 10 and 12 minutes. The&#xD;
      starting resistance and the continuous increase in resistance (between 20-40 watts)&#xD;
      throughout the test was based on the participants' self-reported fitness. Termination of the&#xD;
      VO2max test occurred at volitional fatigue or when the participant could no longer maintain a&#xD;
      cycling cadence of 60 revolutions per minute or higher. Gas-exchange was measured using a&#xD;
      metabolic analyzer (Parvo Medics Inc, TrueOne 2400, Salt Lake City, UT) and data were&#xD;
      analyzed using an 11-breath rolling average20. Primary criteria for a VO2max was categorized&#xD;
      as an observed plateau that varied by less than 150 mlO2/min21. To determine a plateau using&#xD;
      primary criteria, the mean of the absolute difference from each neighboring data point in the&#xD;
      last 30 seconds of the 11-breath rolling average VO2 was compared against 150 mlO2/min21; if&#xD;
      the average value was smaller, the test was categorized as a VO2max. In the absence of a&#xD;
      plateau, a VO2max was confirmed if two of the three secondary criteria were met: 1) an RPE&#xD;
      ≥17, 2) a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of 1.1 or greater, and 3) a HR within 10 beats of&#xD;
      estimated heart rate max using the Jones et al. equation (202 - 0.72 x age). The highest&#xD;
      power output recorded from the VO2max test was used to calculate the high intensity and&#xD;
      active recovery bouts for the HIIE sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Intensity Interval Exercise Trials Before all HIIE sessions participant's hydration&#xD;
      status was assessed measuring urine specific gravity (USG) using a handheld refractometer&#xD;
      (Cole-Parmer, RSA-BR90A, Vernon Hills, IL). A USG measurement lower than 1.020 g/cc allowed&#xD;
      participants to proceed to the HIIE sessions. If USG was greater than 1.020 g/cc, then&#xD;
      participants consumed 500 ml of water, and were reassessed after 30 minutes. This water&#xD;
      provision was only repeated twice if USG remained above 1.020 g/cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized cross over repeated measures design was used to compare cardiovascular,&#xD;
      thermoregulatory, metabolic, and perceived responses before and during HIIE across four&#xD;
      experimental trials performed during two visits. For each visit, which was separated by a&#xD;
      minimum of 72 hours, the participants completed two HIIE sessions separated by 3 hours of&#xD;
      rest. Each HIIE bout consisted of 10 bouts lasting 30 seconds performed at 85% Pmax followed&#xD;
      by 90 seconds of active recovery at 30% Pmax. The HIIE sessions were performed in a temperate&#xD;
      environment (23°C, 25% relative humidity) with (TEMP/MASK) and without a surgical mask&#xD;
      (TEMP/CON), and in a hot environment (36°C, 14% relative humidity) with (HOT/MASK) and&#xD;
      without a surgical mask (HOT/CON). During the exercise protocol participants were allowed to&#xD;
      drink water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During HIIE sessions with a mask, all participants were instructed to wear the surgical mask&#xD;
      snugly over their nose and mouth. The participants fitted the flexible metal plate within the&#xD;
      surgical mask over the bridge of the nose and had the bottom of the mask cover underneath the&#xD;
      chin. During the 3-hour rest period participants were provided a 350-calorie meal (7g of Fat;&#xD;
      64g Carbohydrate; 9g Protein) and water ad libitum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Measurements Before every HIIE trial and after 5-minutes of seated rest,&#xD;
      resting blood pressure was measured using a sphygmomanometer, and stethoscope. A cardiac&#xD;
      impedance device (PhysioFlow®, NeuMeDex, Bristol, PA) calibrated per manufacturer guidelines&#xD;
      was used to indirectly measure cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and HR. These&#xD;
      measurements were taken continuously using 10-second averaging provided by the PhysioFlow®&#xD;
      software during each HIIE session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Measurements A near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) device (Moxy, Moxy Monitor&#xD;
      System, MN, USA) was used to measure muscle tissue oxygenation every second during each HIIE&#xD;
      session. The highest muscle tissue oxygenation value from each active rest period (MTO active&#xD;
      rest %) was averaged for each HIIE session. Additionally, the lowest muscle tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation (MTO during HIIE %) value per high intensity bout was recorded and averaged from&#xD;
      each HIIE session. The difference of the average MTO active rest % and MTO during HIIE % was&#xD;
      used to calculate the muscle tissue oxygenation difference (MTO difference %). All MTO&#xD;
      measurements were taken on the dominant leg at a marked location on the vastus lateralis that&#xD;
      would allow movement without interference from the NIRS device. A pulse oximeter (Caretaker,&#xD;
      Caretaker Medical, USA) was used to measure SpO2 during HIIE. Blood lactate measurements&#xD;
      (Lactate Plus, NOVA Biomedical, MA) were taken in duplicate at the ear lobe immediately&#xD;
      before, and 5-minutes post HIIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceptual Measurement before and during HIIE Borg's rating of perceived exertion (6 rest to&#xD;
      20 maximal effort) scale (RPE) and thermal sensation (0 very cold to 8 very hot) was measured&#xD;
      immediately before and every four minutes into HIIE. A breathlessness scale (0 mm no&#xD;
      breathlessness to 200 mm maximal breathlessness)was used immediately before, at 10-minutes,&#xD;
      and immediately after exercise to record subjective change in difficulty breathing. The&#xD;
      highest measurements for both RPE (peak RPE) and thermal sensation (peak thermal sensation)&#xD;
      were recorded per HIIE session performed. Additionally, RPE (RPE avg) and dyspnea scores were&#xD;
      averaged over time for every HIIE session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal strain and hydration measurements During each HIIE exercise session continuous core&#xD;
      temperature measurements were taken using rectal thermistors (Level 1 esophageal/rectal&#xD;
      temperature probe, Smiths Medical, Minneapolis, MN, USA) connected to a thermometer&#xD;
      (Precision 4000, YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) and monitored to ensure&#xD;
      participant safety. Additionally, ∆ core temperature (i.e., the difference between peak core&#xD;
      temperature and core temperature prior to starting exercise) and peak core temperature were&#xD;
      recorded for each HIIE session. Sweat rate and dehydration were calculated from pre-exercise&#xD;
      nude weight, post-exercise nude weight, water ingestion, and post-exercise urine output&#xD;
      measurements27. Participants were asked to measure and report their pre-exercise and&#xD;
      post-exercise nude weight using a digital scale (Cardinal DETECTO 758C, Webb City, MO) in a&#xD;
      private room.&#xD;
