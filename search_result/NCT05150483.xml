      We attempt to perform dynamic endotyping of critically ill patients presenting in the&#xD;
      emergency department with de novo acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). We also attempt&#xD;
      to identify what clinical, radiological, physiological and biological variables collected&#xD;
      early in the course of AHRF correlate with subsequent mortality and/or persistent severe&#xD;
      hypoxemia.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even before the pandemic of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF),&#xD;
      constituted a public health challenge. Despite the intense research on identifying targeted&#xD;
      pharmacological therapies for ARDS, there is no available treatment for the syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The failure of clinical trials exploring pharmacological therapies for ARDS has been&#xD;
      attributed to incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of the syndrome.&#xD;
      As examples of the heterogeneity of ARDS, our recent work has identified differential&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with ARDS depending on whether hypoxemia is rapidly improving or&#xD;
      persistent severe or associated with non-identifiable risk factors or associated with&#xD;
      neutropenia. It is advocated that the heterogeneity of ARDS can be tangled by a precision&#xD;
      approach, which identifies endotypes of ARDS; i.e., subtypes characterized by a distinct&#xD;
      biological profile that might share mortality risk, clinical course, or treatment&#xD;
      responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding their contributions, current research efforts on endotyping ARDS might be&#xD;
      limited by the fact that they are based on the current conceptual framework of the syndrome,&#xD;
      which has been widely questioned. Indeed, for reasons such as high interobserver variability&#xD;
      of radiological criteria of ARDS and exclusion of patients requiring high-flow nasal oxygen,&#xD;
      influential experts have even suggested to completely abandon the term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, in the current study, we attempt to perform endotyping of critically ill&#xD;
      patients presenting in the emergency department with de novo AHRF, which is a simpler and&#xD;
      more reliable phenotype than ARDS. The approach for endotyping will be dynamic rather than&#xD;
      static; i.e, two blood samples with a 24-hour interval will be used for endotyping to trace&#xD;
      trajectories of biomarkers (over 1500 unique human proteins). In addition, we attempt to&#xD;
      identify what clinical, radiological, physiological and biological variables collected early&#xD;
      in the course of AHRF correlate with subsequent mortality and/or persistent severe hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the research protocol is organized as 3 aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim#1 will organize a registry and biobank of critically ill patients presenting in the&#xD;
      emergency department with de novo AHRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim#2 will build a predictive model to identify what variables among those collected in Aim#1&#xD;
      are associated with subsequent mortality and/or persistent severe hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim#3 will use an agnostic discovery approach to explore novel proteomic biomarkers-based&#xD;
      dynamic endotypes in critically ill patients presenting in the emergency department with de&#xD;
      novo AHRF. Also, Aim#3 will create a multiprotein model of biomarkers associated with&#xD;
      subsequent mortality and/or persistent severe hypoxemia and will determine whether inclusion&#xD;
      of this multiprotein panel in the predictive score developed in Aim#2 improves risk&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;
