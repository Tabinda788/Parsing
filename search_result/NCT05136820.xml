  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Atrial&#xD;
      Flow Regulator in the treatment of subjects, 18 years of age or older, who have symptomatic&#xD;
      heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or heart failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFrEF) while on stable guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) as outlined in the&#xD;
      Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure.&#xD;
