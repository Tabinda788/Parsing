  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the popularization of cervical cancer screening ，more and more patients of cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial lesions have been found. The liberalization of the three child fertility&#xD;
      policy also makes the treatment of patients with cervical intraepithelial lesions to retain&#xD;
      cervical anatomic and physiological function become a trend. Compared with traditional&#xD;
      ablation methods, focused ultrasound has good tissue penetration and controllable focused&#xD;
      characteristics.Preliminary studies have shown that focused ultrasound is no less effective&#xD;
      than traditional cryotherapy in the treatment of cervical intraepithelial lesions. However,&#xD;
      as a new treatment method, the impact of focused ultrasound on cervical anatomic and&#xD;
      physiological function is not clear. At the same time, it is unclear whether focused&#xD;
      ultrasound ablation treatment for cervical intraepithelial lesions will stimulate immune&#xD;
      response to HPV. Although the role of cytokines and vaginal microecology in cervical disease&#xD;
      has been studied, the interaction between vaginal microecology, HPV and mucosal immunity is&#xD;
      not completely clear.Therefore, this study is aimed at investigating the vaginal microecology&#xD;
      and local cervical micro-environment for focused ultrasound ablation in the management of&#xD;
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.This will provide a new and noninvasive method for the&#xD;
      ablation of cervical intraepithelial lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that the mucus secreted by cervical mucosa is the main physical barrier&#xD;
      against HPV. HPV can invade through locally damaged cervical mucosa that stimulate the body's&#xD;
      non-specific immunity and specific immune response to resist the invasion of the virus.The&#xD;
      specific cellular immune response plays a major role in resisting virus proliferation and&#xD;
      inhibiting tumor progression. When pathogens invade, DCs are greatly activated. After&#xD;
      activated by the antigen peptide presented by DCs, CD4 helper T-cells differentiate into Th1&#xD;
      and Th2 effector subsets.A Th1 type cytokine IFN-γ is mainly involved in cellular immune&#xD;
      response.Th2 type cytokines(IL-1β、IL-8、IL-10) are mainly inducing humoral immune response and&#xD;
      inhibiting cellular immune response. The increased expression of IFN-γcontributes to the&#xD;
      clearance of high-risk HPV. It may be a prognostic marker for the clearance of high-risk HPV&#xD;
      in local cervical lesions. The down-regulation of IFN-γ and the up-regulation of IL-10 are&#xD;
      considered to be one of the mechanisms of HPV escaping from the host immune system, which can&#xD;
      produce a local immunosuppressive environment and inhibit the anti-tumor function. According&#xD;
      to The Human Protein Atlas, IL-1β and IL-8 are unfavorable prognostic marker in cervical&#xD;
      cancer, and the expression of them increased in the local cervical lesion with the&#xD;
      progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions. The occurrence of humoral immune&#xD;
      response is later than cellular immune response.Th2 cells can promote the proliferation of B&#xD;
      Cells and induce local reproductive tract mucosa to secrete IgA.In addition, studies have&#xD;
      reported that HPV related IgA are mainly produced in HPV persistent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent HPV infection is the main factor in the progression of cervical lesions and the&#xD;
      occurrence of cervical cancer, but only a few HPV infected women developing cervical cancer,&#xD;
      which indicates that other factors may affect the occurrence of cervical cancer. The&#xD;
      diversity of vaginal microecology is related to HPV infection, cervical lesions and cervical&#xD;
      cancer. According to a new study, the surgical excision of cervical lesions can not alter&#xD;
      vaginal microbiota composition.It appears more plausible that women with CIN have inherent&#xD;
      genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors that shape vaginal microecology composition&#xD;
      before and after treatment. However, it is certain that Lactobacillus can promote HPV&#xD;
      clearance and the reversal of cervical lesions. Relevant studies indicate Lactobacillus&#xD;
      inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study of women planned for local cervical treatment aims to&#xD;
      explore the impact of the ablation of disease on the vaginal microecology and innate immune,&#xD;
      and further explore how these pre- and post-treatments compare to healthy untreated controls.&#xD;
