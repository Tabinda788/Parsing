  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new electronic patch has been developed that makes non-invasive measurements of&#xD;
      bioimpedance in underlying tissues. The purpose of this study is to map the patch's ability&#xD;
      to detect specific changes in hydration status in moderate hypovolemia with the device. In&#xD;
      addition, the researchers want to record normal variation (diurnal variation and variation&#xD;
      related to factors such as body position and body temperature) in bioimpedance in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers&#xD;

      This study is an open crossover study. The study group will consist of healthy volunteers who&#xD;
      are wearing patches over 8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of study The purpose of the study is to test the ability of a new electronic patch to&#xD;
      detect moderate dehydration and re-hydration by changes in bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS).&#xD;
      In addition, the researchers will study changes in bioimpedance related to normal variation&#xD;
      in tissue hydration circadian changes, skin thickness, posture, and moderate activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the detection of the dehydrated state after intervention A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      detection a re-hydrated state after mild dehydration. detection of any significant&#xD;
      differences between the two dehydration interventions description of the circadian changes of&#xD;
      normal healthy volunteers Hypothesis: The patch can detect a BIS change in local fluid volume&#xD;
      in case of moderate dehydration correlated to reference points for fluid loss (blood samples,&#xD;
      diuresis, weight loss, self-experience of thirst). Secondary hypothesis: The patch can detect&#xD;
      a BIS change in local fluid volume after rehydration from moderate dehydration correlated to&#xD;
      reference points for fluid loss (blood samples, diuresis, weight gain, self-experience of&#xD;
      thirst).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary hypothesis: The patch can detect a significant difference in BIS between the two&#xD;
      intervention methods (pharmacologic and physical exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical implementation The study is conducted by bringing healthy volunteers to a normal&#xD;
      volume, isotonic state through intake of water and logging of food and liquid intake&#xD;
      (including alcohol), physical activity, drug intake and number of days since the first day of&#xD;
      the last menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject undergoes a clinical examination, including weighing and measuring and an&#xD;
      assessment of skin thickness as well as blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The position for placement of the patch is marked with a marker and photographed. then the&#xD;
      patches are mounted in accordance with the description in the Instructions for Use (IFU). One&#xD;
      patch is placed on the back, one under the arm pit and one on the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will carry the patches for eight days. The patch on the back will be replaced by&#xD;
      a new patch after the first intervention. The other two patches will stay on throughout the&#xD;
      eight days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects are exposed to two different interventions (A and B) while being monitored by&#xD;
      health personnel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: one physical exercise on a bicycle for 60 minutes at 80 of max heart rate (HR), leading to&#xD;
      a loss of more than 1.5% of body weight. The subjects are monitored for an additional two&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: one where the subjects are given a diuretic (Furosemide) and monitored for three hours&#xD;
      without any intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - both interventions are followed by controlled intake of liquid intake two hours into the&#xD;
      intervention, the liquid containing glucose and electrolytes (Resorb Sport, Nestle S.A.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will carry out both interventions, but on two different days. There must be a&#xD;
      minimum of 24 hours between two interventions. The subject must consume 500 ml of water two&#xD;
      hours prior to starting either of the two controlled interventions. The purpose of fluid&#xD;
      intake is to correct any existing dehydration, while giving the body time to expel excess&#xD;
      fluid and to reach the desired normal degree of hydration.&#xD;
