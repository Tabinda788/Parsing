    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study to is to determine the overall impact of a clinical&#xD;
      program of remote medication monitoring administered by St. Mary's Homecare on disease&#xD;
      control in pediatric asthma patients. The central hypothesis is that a short-term program of&#xD;
      remote asthma medication monitoring paired with home visits and asthma education will be&#xD;
      associated with a sustained improvement in asthma symptom control in children over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, prospective observational cohort study of 20 children with poorly controlled&#xD;
      persistent asthma over 12 months exploring response to an intensive asthma monitoring and&#xD;
      education program. The program consists of the following administered over a 6-month period:&#xD;
      1) A remote medication monitoring system (Propeller devices and monitoring administered by&#xD;
      St. Mary's Healthcare) and 2) home visits by St. Mary's asthma nurses. The Propeller devices&#xD;
      are electronic inhaler sensors which monitor the use of metered dose inhalers (as well as&#xD;
      other medication delivery devices) and captures the date and time of use. This is an FDA&#xD;
      approved device aimed at promoting asthma self-management in a cost-effective manner. The&#xD;
      sensor stores and transmits information via Bluetooth to a paired wireless data transmitter,&#xD;
      which sends the data to a secured server accessible by St. Mary's Healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two phases described below. Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Subjects are&#xD;
      enrolled in the St. Mary's Healthcare home visiting and remote medication monitoring program&#xD;
      through referral by the physicians/nurse practitioners providing asthma care and the Weill&#xD;
      Cornell Pediatric Asthma Program. They will then undergo an initial home visit by a St.&#xD;
      Mary's asthma program nurse, where they are equipped with Propeller devices for their&#xD;
      controller medication (as prescribed by their physician) and rescue medication (albuterol),&#xD;
      and are connected to St. Mary's remote monitoring system. Remote monitoring, home visits and&#xD;
      in-person/video visit clinical assessment with asthma education will be provided during this&#xD;
      time (see below). The St. Mary's remote monitoring system and telehealth nurse collects&#xD;
      medication administration data obtained through the Propeller monitoring system in real-time,&#xD;
      which is made available clinically to the subjects' medical providers on a monthly basis for&#xD;
      review, or if there is substantial deviation from prescribed medication administration or&#xD;
      increased use of rescue medication necessitating an intervention by St. Mary's telehealth&#xD;
      nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the following outcomes data will be collected on a monthly basis via telephone&#xD;
      or office/video visit by the study team to assess overall asthma control and health care use:&#xD;
      Number of emergency room visits or hospitalizations for asthma in the last month, number of&#xD;
      urgent care or primary care visits for asthma symptoms, number of albuterol prescriptions&#xD;
      renewed, number of oral steroid prescriptions filled, number of missed school days, and an&#xD;
      ACT score to assess control. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) will be performed at the time&#xD;
      of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Subjects will have completed remote asthma medication monitoring by&#xD;
      the St. Mary's Program, and are observed for an additional 6 months by the study team to&#xD;
      determine the response to the administered program. Subjects will have outcomes data (as&#xD;
      described in Phase 1) collected via telephone or video visit; a minimum of 2 provider office&#xD;
      or video visits will occur during this phase. PFTs will be performed at least once during&#xD;
      this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote monitoring: Remote devices collect prospective data regarding use of controller&#xD;
      medication as prescribed and any doses of rescue medication administered. If a patient is&#xD;
      using their rescue inhaler above or using their controller inhaler less than prescribed, a&#xD;
      St. Mary's Telehealth Nurse will receive an alert in real time. The Telehealth Nurse will&#xD;
      contact the patient or caregiver to assess the situation and intervene, either by providing&#xD;
      reminders or assessing for changes in clinical status. The Telehealth Nurse will initiate&#xD;
      communication with their medical provider or emergency services as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home visits: Subjects enrolled in this program will be provided with up to 6 asthma nursing&#xD;
      visits over the 12month study period as standard practice of St. Mary's home visitation&#xD;
      program and based on the individual needs of the subject. A minimum of 2 nursing visits will&#xD;
      be administered during phase 1 for clinical monitoring and asthma education/asthma management&#xD;
      reinforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider visits: Patients will have a physician office or video visit with NYPH-WCM providers&#xD;
      scheduled during Month 2 and Month 5 of Phase 1 for standard clinical follow up, and to&#xD;
      review their medication usage and provide directed feedback. This will be bundled with a&#xD;
      dedicated asthma education session with WCM-Pediatric Asthma Program asthma educators to&#xD;
      review/reinforce medication administration techniques and provide tailored asthma education&#xD;
      for the development of asthma self-management skills. There will be a minimum of 2 scheduled&#xD;
      Provider visits during Phase 2.&#xD;
