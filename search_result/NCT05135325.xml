  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of November 2021, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a months-long&#xD;
      national shortage of several types of blood in the U.S. (O-Pos, O-Neg, A-Neg, B-Neg, and&#xD;
      AB-Neg), which has extended to a local blood shortage within the Geisinger community. The&#xD;
      broad aim of this collaborative healthcare operations quality improvement project is to&#xD;
      determine whether a message indicating that a patient's own blood type is in short supply&#xD;
      increases the likelihood that they will donate, compared to a message that mentions a blood&#xD;
      shortage without referencing the patient's blood type, or no message at all. Scientists in&#xD;
      Geisinger's Behavioral Insights Team (BIT), part of Geisinger's Steele Institute for Health&#xD;
      Innovation, will collaborate with Miller Keystone, where Geisinger refers patients who wish&#xD;
      to donate blood and from whom Geisinger receives blood for clinical purposes. Patients with&#xD;
      one of the needed blood types will be randomized to receive 1) a message about a blood&#xD;
      shortage that does not specify the blood types in short supply or their own blood type&#xD;
      (no-blood-type message), 2) the same message modified slightly to specify the recipient's&#xD;
      blood type, and to mention that their blood type is in short supply (blood-type message), or&#xD;
      3) no message (shortage control group). A second no-contact control group of patients without&#xD;
      any of the needed blood types will also be observed (no-shortage control group). Both the&#xD;
      blood-type and no-blood-type messages are informed by behavioral science, emphasizing supply&#xD;
      needs in local hospitals and providing community-relevant examples of why someone might need&#xD;
      blood (e.g., farming or industrial accidents). The BIT will compare how many patients in each&#xD;
      group choose to donate blood. They hypothesize that: 1) patients who receive either message&#xD;
      will be more likely to donate than patients who receive no message; and 2) patients who&#xD;
      receive the blood-type message will be more likely to donate than those who receive the&#xD;
      no-blood-type message. With respect to the latter hypothesis, informing the recipient that&#xD;
      they have one of the needed blood types may increase their perception that they are in a&#xD;
      semi-unique position to help someone in need as compared to a more general message that may&#xD;
      suffer from a diffusion of responsibility effect.&#xD;
