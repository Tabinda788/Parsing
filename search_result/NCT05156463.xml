  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a Physical Activity Index (PAI) tool that&#xD;
      collects measures on physical activity, strength training and sedentary behavior can be used&#xD;
      in a clinical setting to monitor patient behavior and provide specific recommendations on how&#xD;
      to achieve and maintain behavior goals. The tool will be used after treatment is completed in&#xD;
      breast and colon cancer survivors and will test if physician counseling combined with patient&#xD;
      self-monitoring improves physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior over time.&#xD;

    <description>This self-report questionnaire assesses weekly frequency and duration of a variety of lifestyle physical activities that are meaningful and appropriate for older adults. Scores are recorded based on number of repetitions the activity was completed and the hours spent doing the activity from less than 1 hour to 9 or more hours.</description>
