    <textblock>
      The investigators will be recruiting patients in the primary care setting to enroll a weight&#xD;
      loss program where they will be seen every 2 weeks for 3 months, and then every month for 3&#xD;
      months, and the investigators will implement specific interventions tailored to the patients'&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that weight loss programs with a multidisciplinary approach in&#xD;
      the primary care setting have been more successful in achieving weight loss in overweight and&#xD;
      obese patients compared to general recommendations to lose weight. A multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach may include involvement of a dietician and a behavioral psychologist, which the&#xD;
      investigators will not be able to replicate in our study. However, some of those studies have&#xD;
      also shown that frequent follow-up visits have also been shown to be helpful for weight loss.&#xD;
      Frequent follow ups help with weight loss because it helps patients maintain their&#xD;
      accountability by giving them realistic goals with measurable deadlines. Education is also an&#xD;
      important factor to weight loss, including understanding an individualized dietary and&#xD;
      exercise approach. Weight loss in the primary care setting is of great significance because&#xD;
      it can offload healthcare costs by reducing the morbidity of disease for a variety of&#xD;
      comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      exercise alone (without any reduction in weight) improves hypertension and glucose&#xD;
      sensitivity in patients. The investigators hypothesize that achieving weight loss will have&#xD;
      an additive effect to these health improvements. The American Heart Association recently&#xD;
      revised their cholesterol guidelines for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (ASCVD) by listing the first and foremost recommendation as: &quot;a healthy lifestyle reduces&#xD;
      ASCVD risk at all ages. In all age groups, lifestyle therapy is the primary intervention for&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&quot; So, diet and lifestyle modifications are recognized by many societies as&#xD;
      an important and necessary intervention for patients to live healthy lives and decrease the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality associated with disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, overweight and obese people also have a high incidence of chronic joint pains&#xD;
      which often result in therapies, invasive joint surgeries, immobility, or chronic treatments&#xD;
      with prescription pain medications. It has been shown that these joint pains can be reduced&#xD;
      with weight loss preventing the need for those aforementioned therapies which have a high&#xD;
      cost burden on the healthcare system. The biggest determining factor of weight loss is a&#xD;
      person's adherence to the intervention, which will hope to address with close follow up to&#xD;
      hold patient's accountable to their weight loss goals.&#xD;
