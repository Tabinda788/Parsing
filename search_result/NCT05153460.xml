  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dozee VS device developed by Turtle Shell Technologies Pvt. Ltd., is a contactless&#xD;
      continuous vital parameters monitoring system. It is designed for continuous and contactless&#xD;
      measurement of Heart Rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (RR). The device uses the concept of&#xD;
      ballistocardiography and deploys piezoelectric sensors to capture the micro-vibrations&#xD;
      originating from cardiac contractions, upper respiratory tract activity and body movements.&#xD;
      This data is then analyzed by a proprietary algorithm and the values of the vital parameters&#xD;
      - Heart Rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (RR) are generated. The captured vital parameters can&#xD;
      be accessed remotely via a dashboard which can be accessed on any web browser and a&#xD;
      smartphone application. The sensor sheet is placed below the mattress and captures data while&#xD;
      the user is resting or sleeping and does not require a sensor to be fixed to the body. It&#xD;
      consists of the following sub - units: Contactless sensor sheet, Dozee Pod with power cord, 5&#xD;
      V USB Power Adapter, Health data compute server and Web Dashboard/Mobile App. This provides a&#xD;
      more comfortable solution for long-term continuous patient monitoring. Continuous monitoring&#xD;
      of people's vital signs, in particular Heart Rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (RR), may provide&#xD;
      a mechanism to alert doctors or nurses of clinical deterioration. Monitoring people's vital&#xD;
      signs outside an ICU often relies on nursing staff conducting checks at set intervals. The&#xD;
      device can reduce the workload for nursing staff in non-ICU wards.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dozee VS device is intended for the contactless continuous monitoring of vital parameters&#xD;
      (Heart Rate and Respiratory Rate), and screening for abnormal changes in these parameters.&#xD;
      The device is intended to be used to monitor individuals/patients greater than eighteen (18)&#xD;
      years of age (40 kg ≤ weight ≤ 120 kg) and can measure their vital signs during sleep and&#xD;
      resting state. The data can be viewed on the dashboard, exported and even be directly&#xD;
      transferred to the in-house hospital management software. This protocol aims at verifying the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the investigational device in a general-care clinical&#xD;
      environment. A similar predicate can be found in the FDA-cleared EarlySense Insight System&#xD;
      (K152911) developed by EarlySense Ltd which shall be used as the predicate device. The device&#xD;
      also uses the concept of ballistocardiography and employs piezoelectric sensors to create a&#xD;
      contact-less continuous monitoring system which monitors the same vital parameters. It has&#xD;
      been sold in over 20 U.S. hospitals since 2013, with no recalls or adverse events reported.&#xD;
      According to publicly available clinical results, this system has shown an 86% reduction in&#xD;
      Code Blue events, and a 45% reduction in Length of Stay (LoS) in the ICU for patients coming&#xD;
      from the medical/surgical unit. The technology employed and the indications for use for the&#xD;
      EarlySense device is very similar to the Dozee VS device.&#xD;

        The study will be conducted on 105 subjects in the age group above 18 years regardless of&#xD;
        gender. The patients admitted in the hospital will be informed about the study and a&#xD;
        written informed consent form will be obtained from them. Dozee will be placed under the&#xD;
        mattress of the patient's bed and the data will be collected through the device whenever a&#xD;
        patient is on the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The research team members responsible for data analysis will have access only to the fully&#xD;
        anonymised individual-level data and will be blinded to any other patient data, as well as&#xD;
        to the components of the calculated scores in the hospital information system.&#xD;
