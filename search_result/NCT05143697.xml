  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary care settings lack interventions to address the childhood obesity epidemic that are&#xD;
      feasible and sustainable without requiring significant resources. The investigators propose&#xD;
      to modify and test an intervention shown to lower children's body mass index(BMI) so that it&#xD;
      is feasible, sustainable, and easily disseminated in a real-world clinical setting. If&#xD;
      successful, the investigators will be able to provide recommendations to providers and health&#xD;
      care systems that help prioritize future intervention strategies and research investments to&#xD;
      reduce obesity in children that can be quickly translated into other settings and widely&#xD;
      adopted after the study period, with the goal of halting and reversing the childhood obesity&#xD;
      epidemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of childhood obesity in the United States (US) remain at historic highs. Before the age&#xD;
      of 11 years, 18% of all children in the US are already obese; 26% of Hispanic and 24% of&#xD;
      Black children are obese. Pediatric primary care settings are underutilized in preventing and&#xD;
      treating childhood obesity. An evidence-based method for treatment of childhood obesity to&#xD;
      help engage and motivate patients is Motivational Interviewing (MI). One recent successful&#xD;
      study, BMI2 (for Brief Motivational Interviewing to Reduce Child Body Mass Index) directed at&#xD;
      the parents of children in pediatric care practices lowered body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      significantly. MI-based approaches have been particularly successful for racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minorities and low-income populations. However, the targeted MI dose of BMI2 requires&#xD;
      significant resources, with MI sessions administered by the PCP and a registered dietician.&#xD;
      It is unclear whether the impressive results of BMI2 can be replicated in a health care&#xD;
      system with real-world conditions. It is challenging to find an effective intervention that&#xD;
      is feasible and sustainable without requiring significant resources. Our overall goal is to&#xD;
      reduce excess body weight in children in primary care. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in 36 pediatric clinics in Kaiser Permanente Southern&#xD;
      California (KPSC) to test the effectiveness of a modified version of BMI2 intervention in&#xD;
      pediatric clinics (18 intervention, 18 usual care with attention control, = 10,800 children).&#xD;
      The clinics serve over 45,000 children aged 2-8 yrs who are overweight or obese with high&#xD;
      racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity (53% Hispanic; 23% state-subsidized insurance).&#xD;
      Using MI techniques, primary care providers (PCPs) will initiate and maintain discussion&#xD;
      about weight management with parent (6 x 20 min) and refer patients electronically to&#xD;
      experienced and MI-trained lifestyle coaches. With full access to the electronic medical&#xD;
      record (EMR), coaches will call referred families (child's BMI-for-age ≥85th percentile) and&#xD;
      deliver intervention via telephonic MI counseling over two years (6 x 45 min). Usual care&#xD;
      clinics with attention control will include regular encounters and educational videos as&#xD;
      attention control. Primary Aim: Determine the effectiveness and dose-response relationship of&#xD;
      a pragmatic, system-integrated childhood obesity intervention using mBMI2Kids (a modified&#xD;
      BMI2 approach) on BMI at 2-yr follow-up. Secondary Aim: Investigate how patient&#xD;
      characteristics such as minority or low-income background and parental obesity modify the&#xD;
      effect of the mBMI2Kids intervention (Heterogeneity of effects). IMPACT: This study has the&#xD;
      potential for a highly significant shift in pediatric primary care practices. Our results&#xD;
      will provide valuable guidance to providers and health care systems to help them effectively&#xD;
      halt and reverse the childhood obesity epidemic. Our results can be quickly translated into&#xD;
      other clinical care settings and endorse the meaningful use of EMR systems to support&#xD;
      providers using tools and centralized approaches that make interventions scalable.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study is a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial to test the impact of a modified version of the BMI2 intervention, which we have named mBMI2Kids. Target population are children aged 2-8 years with a BMI-for-age ≥85 percentile from 36 Kaiser Permanente pediatric clinics in Southern California. All children and their parent/guardian reached will be included according to the clinic in which they receive care (Intervention-to-treat approach).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Hypothesis 1-1: At 2-yr follow-up, patients ages 2-8 yrs with baseline BMI ≥85th percentile who were reached in intervention clinics will show a net mean BMI decrease between 0.8 and 1.0 kg/m2 (adjusted for sex, age) compared to usual care (population effect).&#xD;
Hypothesis 1-2: At 2-yr follow-up, patients who received the full planned MI-dose (defined as 8 of 12 sessions) will show a net mean BMI decrease between 1.0 and 1.2 kg/m2 (adjusted for sex, age) compared to usual care (individual effect).</description>

    <description>Minority or low-income background patients need a higher MI dose than other patient groups in achieving a targeted mean BMI decrease of 1.0 kg/m2 (adjusted for sex, age).&#xD;
Guided by the RE-AIM framework18, we will examine reach (based on participation), effectiveness (BMI) com-pared to usual care, MI dose-response), adoption (based on clinics and PCPs participating actively), implementation (fidelity to intervention, delayed intervention), and address maintenance and potential sustainability.</description>

    <description>For clinics assigned to mBMI2Kids intervention, Pediatricians will be trained in Motivational Interviewing (MI) and behavioral intervention. Pediatricians will conduct up to 3 sessions with each parent (3 x 10 min) and refer patients electronically to experienced MI-trained lifestyle coaches. With full access to the electronic medical record coaches will call referred families (child's BMI-for-age ≥85th percentile) and deliver a telephonic MI counseling over two years (6 x 45 min) simultaneous with pediatricians. 36 clinics will be selected with 18 participating in the intervention and 18 providing patients with usual care.</description>

    <description>The investigators propose to conduct a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in 36 pediatric clinics in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), to test the effectiveness of mBMI2Kids (a modified version of the BMI2 interven-tion) in pediatric clinics (randomization unit). Clinics serve over 45,000 children aged 2-8 yrs who are obese and have high racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity (53% Hispanic; 23% state-subsidized insurance). Clinics will be randomized into either 18 intervention or 18 usual care + attention control (enrolling 10,800 children). KP's long-standing electronic medical record (EMR) and stable membership, a research team embedded in care, existing team of lifestyle coaches, and ability to rapidly disseminate findings makes us uniquely positioned to conduct this study.</description>
