  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with severe mental illness (SMI) spend a great amount of time in their homes. The home&#xD;
      is thus of vital importance for an everyday life with meaningful activities. Systematic&#xD;
      description of possibilities for meaningful activity in Supported Housing (SH) is however&#xD;
      lacking. Even more importantly, support to meaningful activity in the SH context is sadly&#xD;
      lacking. That there is a need for support to activity for those who live in SH is partly&#xD;
      evident from research, but has also become obvious through several contacts between the&#xD;
      investigators' research group and staff working in SH settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first step the investigators described how people with SMI use their time while being at&#xD;
      home and how the participants perceive their possibilities for being active. Comparisons were&#xD;
      made with people with SMI who had ordinary housing and got housing support. A mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach with well-established rating scales and qualitative interviews was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Based on the findings from Step 1 above, develop an intervention for those who live in&#xD;
           SH. The intervention goal is to increase the possibilities for satisfying engagement in&#xD;
           activities in one's home. The intervention will also build on previous experiences form&#xD;
           developing and evaluating interventions for the target group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate what changes people who participate in such an intervention will make&#xD;
           regarding engagement in activities, satisfaction with activities, recovery from mental&#xD;
           illness, self-rated health, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate how users and staff perceive the SH services' possibilities to offer or&#xD;
           stimulate to different types of activity, as well as their satisfaction with the new&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with SMI are a sadly neglected group with respect to access to meaningful activities.&#xD;
      Enriching supported with features that enable more meaningful activity in the home context&#xD;
      could lead to gains for the individual (increased well-being) as well as society (better&#xD;
      services and decreased needs for support). The project is of relevance for both persons with&#xD;
      SMI and society through its emphasis on 1) well-being among people with substantial&#xD;
      functional limitations and 2) a meaningful everyday life in the intersection between housing&#xD;
      and activity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Main Purpose People with severe mental illness (SMI) say that being active and&#xD;
      taking part in social interaction are the most essential elements for being able to&#xD;
      experience meaning in life. Interventions and research into activity for this target group&#xD;
      have so far been concentrated on work rehabilitation and on meaningful activities in&#xD;
      community-based activity centres. The common denominator here is the assumption that the&#xD;
      individual leaves their residence in order to engage in activities. The focus of this&#xD;
      application is, however, on the individual's situation in their home environment. The latter&#xD;
      can vary from living in one's own apartment/ house without support, often termed ordinary&#xD;
      housing, to supported housing (SH), which links housing and support and is situated in&#xD;
      supervised group homes or apartments located in one building. An intermediate form is housing&#xD;
      support, which is when a person living in an ordinary home receives support in order to&#xD;
      manage that situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The home is of fundamental importance for the possibilities for people with SMI to lead an&#xD;
      everyday life characterized by meaningful activities, being as this group spend a greater&#xD;
      part of their time in the home setting. Activity in one's home is also linked with&#xD;
      occupational engagement in other social and geographical contexts. There is a lack of&#xD;
      interventions aiming at improving the possibilities for an active and engaged everyday life&#xD;
      within the frame of the home setting and the near neighbourhood. The need for support in this&#xD;
      field is evident from the research literature, but has also emerged in countless contacts&#xD;
      between the investigator's research group and staff working with supported housing and&#xD;
      housing support for people with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project is Step two of research aiming to promote meaningful and engaging&#xD;
      activities in the home setting for people with SMI in SH, and thereby also support their&#xD;
      health, well-being and recovery. Step 1 was a survey of how people with SMI who live in SH,&#xD;
      compared to those who receive housing support in an ordinary home, used their time while in&#xD;
      their homes and how the participants experienced their opportunities for activity. Findings&#xD;
      revealed that the residents had a low activity level and were often alone. The conclusion was&#xD;
      that services need to support individually adjusted contextual stimuli and individualize the&#xD;
      support to help residents find a good balance and motivate them to be active in and outside&#xD;
      SH, which can support a recovery process. Against this background, the aims of Step 2 are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design an intervention for those who live in SH, on the basis of Step 1 and previous&#xD;
           research on activity- and recovery-based interventions, for increasing the residents'&#xD;
           opportunities for satisfactory engagement in everyday activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the intervention by mixed methods, including an uncontrolled quantitative study&#xD;
           and qualitative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey of the field Research on SH and housing support for people with SMI has developed&#xD;
      during the last years. The focus has been on comparing institutional and community living and&#xD;
      on the individual's preferences as to how SH residents wish to live. The participants' views&#xD;
      on their living arrangements and on aspects of the physical and psychosocial environments&#xD;
      have also been examined. However, research on activities in the home environment has received&#xD;
      very little attention in Sweden and internationally, although Priebe et al. reported on how&#xD;
      support from the staff was adjusted to promote self-care activities in SH in Great Britain. A&#xD;
      small-scale study in Sweden found that rehabilitation, which was based on occupational&#xD;
      therapy and client-centeredness and aimed at increased activity in the SH context, resulted&#xD;
      in good progress regarding both activity and health-related factors. The improvements were&#xD;
      seen to be maintained in a six-month follow-up perspective thus indicating that this was a&#xD;
      promising intervention. Only 17 participants were included in that study, however, which&#xD;
      makes generalisation impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity is defined, in the present application, as everyday life activities in a broad&#xD;
      sense, including work-related activities, household work, self-care, and all kinds of&#xD;
      recreational activities (physical, cultural and social). Whereas work-related activities are&#xD;
      mainly performed outside the home, taking care of one's home, self-care and leisure&#xD;
      activities often take place in the home. There is convincing evidence of a strong connection&#xD;
      between on the one hand satisfying and engaging activities, and on the other health and&#xD;
      well-being. This makes it important to find the best support for meaningful activities and&#xD;
      engaging activities in different areas of life, in the home as well as in activity centres&#xD;
      and in relation to working life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research indicates that the residents in SH are those who have the most severe SMI&#xD;
      and the activity level in that context is very low. Bejerholm and Eklund found that people&#xD;
      with schizophrenia, some of whom lived in SH, spent a great deal of time at home, alone, and&#xD;
      with a very limited repertoire of activities, very often spending time lying resting and&#xD;
      thinking, watching TV, and smoking. Those living in ordinary housing were engaged in public&#xD;
      activities to a greater extent than those receiving different kinds of housing services. It&#xD;
      also appeared that those who were more strongly engaged in activities were more satisfied&#xD;
      with current housing conditions and level of independence. Research has also shown that&#xD;
      housing with optimal support can promote recovery from mental illness. Based on the above and&#xD;
      since meaningful activity is an important aspect of recovery from mental illness, it is&#xD;
      obvious that further descriptive and comparative research is important for identifying&#xD;
      subgroups and activity areas where support is needed to enable meaningful, engaging and&#xD;
      satisfactory activities in the home setting and the near environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents in SH are a vulnerable group with a great need for support. The fact that people&#xD;
      with SMI often lead isolated and passive lives makes it important to consider efforts that&#xD;
      can support a more meaningful life for SH residents. Such efforts can also include staff to&#xD;
      accomplish the best possible impact. Research has shown that preconceptions about support and&#xD;
      activity among staff working in SH are of importance for how the support measures are&#xD;
      designed in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project will answering the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Considering the results from Step 1 and previous experience from evaluating&#xD;
           interventions for the target group, what are the implications for the development of an&#xD;
           intervention, within the context of SH, in order to improve the opportunities for&#xD;
           creating a satisfying engagement in everyday activities? How can such an intervention be&#xD;
           designed?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What changes will people who participate in such an intervention make regarding&#xD;
           engagement in activities, satisfaction with activities, recovery from mental illness,&#xD;
           self-rated health, and quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do users and staff perceive the housing services' possibilities to offer or&#xD;
           stimulate to different types of activity, and what is their satisfaction with the new&#xD;
           intervention? From now on, that intervention is termed Active in my Home (AiMH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The project will be based on mixed methods and be using both quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative methodology. Trained research assistants will perform the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No precisely comparable study can be used as a basis for the power calculation, but we&#xD;
      consider the SDO instrument, which assesses satisfaction with everyday occupations, to be an&#xD;
      adequate measure for a power analysis. A study found a mean difference of 0.5 points on the&#xD;
      SDO between groups of people with mental illness who had varying structure to their everyday&#xD;
      life. Based on the means and standard deviations from that study, we recently made power&#xD;
      calculations for another study and arrived at 41 participants in each group as the desired&#xD;
      sample size to detect a difference on the SDO of 0.5 with 80% power at p&lt;0.05. Since that&#xD;
      study seemed somewhat underpowered we aim to include 60 residents. The number of staff will&#xD;
      be what is available; we invite those who work with the 60 residents who have agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the AiMH intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be investigated with well tested instruments with good psychometric&#xD;
      qualities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, qualitative studies will be made in order to gain a greater understanding of the&#xD;
      possibilities of providing meaningful and engaging activities in the home context. Focus&#xD;
      groups with users are planned in order to stimulate reflection and discussion. The&#xD;
      transcripts will be analysed by latent content analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uncontrolled evaluation (questions b and c above) will include three measurement points:&#xD;
      a baseline before the intervention, post-measurement after competed intervention and&#xD;
      follow-up measurement 6-9 months later. SH units will be sought in various geographical areas&#xD;
      in southern, western and eastern Sweden. Residents who meet the criteria of: having a severe&#xD;
      mental illness (&gt; 2 years of contact with psychiatric services and an estimated level of&#xD;
      functioning of &lt; 50 on the GAF scale), not having substance abuse as the main diagnosis, not&#xD;
      having comorbidity of dementia or intellectual disability, and being able to speak and&#xD;
      understand Swedish will be invited. SH units in the public sector as well as the private&#xD;
      sector will be invited. We plan to include 10 units to start with. The inclusion of new SH&#xD;
      units will go on until the desired sample of 60 participants has been obtained. By inviting&#xD;
      staff who support these participants, we estimate that about the same number of staff members&#xD;
      (=60) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will be performed to gain a deeper insight into the perceptions of the&#xD;
      AIMH intervention of the residents, the staff and the significant others. Not to intervene&#xD;
      with the AIMH intervention, the interviews (audiotaped) will be made after completed&#xD;
      follow-ups. The idea is to perform individual interviews to catch residents' experiences, but&#xD;
      focus groups with staff to stimulate reflection and discussion. The interview data will be&#xD;
      transcribed and analyzed with qualitative content analysis.&#xD;

Their task is to participate in a couple of the sessions, inspire the course participant to stick to strategies developed during the sessions and support activity in general between the occupational therapy sessions.&#xD;
AiMH consists of eight sessions, five individual ones and three in a group. Each session has a theme, such as: &quot;activity and health&quot;, and is built up with short lessons, using one's senses such as smell or touch, testing a simple activity, and setting goals for an activity one wants to test between sessions. The participants are given around 25 USD to try out that activity.</description>
