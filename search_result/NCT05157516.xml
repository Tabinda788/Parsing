    <measure>Pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Depending on age and cognitive abilities only one score will be obtained either visual analog scale [VAS] or face, legs, activity, and cry consolability scale [FLACC ] The VAS consists of a 10 centimeters line, with two end points representing 0 ('no pain') and 10 ('pain as bad as it could possibly be') leading to a pain intensity score out of 10&#xD;
FLACC scale will be measured as following:&#xD;
Each category (face,legs,activity, and cry consolability) is scored on the 0-2 scale which results in a total score of 0-10.&#xD;
Assessment of the final score:&#xD;
0 = Relaxed and comfortable 1-3 = Mild discomfort 4-6 = Moderate pain 7-10 = Severe discomfort/pain</description>

    <measure>pain scores</measure>
