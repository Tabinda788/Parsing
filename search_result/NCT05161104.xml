  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart, one of the most important organs for oxygen supply and consumption, is frequently&#xD;
      involved in sepsis, i.e. septic cardiomyopathy, also known as septic myocardial suppression.&#xD;
      The occurrence of septic myocardial suppression increases mortality in septic patients.&#xD;
      Recent studies have found that left ventricular hyperdynamic state (EF &gt; 70%) is associated&#xD;
      with intra-ICU mortality in septic patients, possibly because it reflects unresolved vascular&#xD;
      paralysis from sepsis . For septic myocardial suppression, there is still a lack of uniform&#xD;
      criteria for diagnosis, but it is well established that the cardiac ultrasound phenotype of&#xD;
      septic myocardial suppression can be left ventricular systolic insufficiency (LVSD), left&#xD;
      ventricular diastolic insufficiency (LVDD), right ventricular insufficiency (RVD), diffuse&#xD;
      ventricular insufficiency, and mixed ventricular insufficiency. According to incomplete&#xD;
      statistics, the prevalence of LVSD ranges from 12 to 60%, the prevalence of LVDD is higher,&#xD;
      20% to 79%, and the prevalence of RVD varies from 30% to 55%. However, based on the current&#xD;
      understanding of septic myocardial suppression, the relationship between each staging and its&#xD;
      prognosis is unclear, and echocardiography can rapidly identify septic myocardial suppression&#xD;
      and guide the classification of septic myocardial suppression to further optimize the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment process of sepsis, especially to avoid over-resuscitation during&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation and perform reverse resuscitation in a timely manner to improve patient&#xD;
      prognosis and reduce hospitalization time. The aim of this study is to classify and evaluate&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients with different septic cardiac ultrasound phenotypes in multiple&#xD;
      centers across China by measuring the right and left heart systolic and diastolic indices by&#xD;
      echocardiography, recording the baseline conditions and clinical indices of patients, and&#xD;
      combining them with the prognosis.&#xD;

        All patients with sepsis or septic shock who conform to Sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria and&#xD;
        were more than or equal to 18 years of age who were admitted to each center were included.&#xD;
        Sepsis was defined as an increase of ≥2 points from baseline in sequential organ failure&#xD;
        assessment (SOFA) score due to infection; septic shock was defined as persistent&#xD;
        hypotension on top of sepsis, requiring vasoactive drugs to maintain a mean arterial&#xD;
        pressure(MAP) ≥65 mmHg and a blood lactate level &gt;2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid&#xD;
        resuscitation.&#xD;
