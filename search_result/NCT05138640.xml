  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk for a subsequent fracture is significantly higher in patients presenting with a&#xD;
      fracture compared to individuals without a previous fracture and is highest within the first&#xD;
      2 years after the initial fracture. The risk for a subsequent fracture is not dependent of&#xD;
      BMD as measured by conventional DXA. In recent studies, it has been shown that HRpQCT&#xD;
      measurements provide information about bone structure, bone quality and bone strength in&#xD;
      addition to BMD measurements. Diagnostic strategies should be focussed on bone quality and&#xD;
      bone strength and fall prediction in the patients at high risk for falls, subsequent fracture&#xD;
      and mortality such as patients with a recent fracture. Therefore, the investigators conduct a&#xD;
      prospective observational study in 500 patients aged 50 years and older who present with a&#xD;
      clinical fracture for evaluation of bone strength, physical activity, falls, subsequent&#xD;
      fractures and mortality during a follow-up period of 3 years.&#xD;
