  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates whether a decision aid application (app) is effective in&#xD;
      helping breast reconstruction surgery patients make informed decisions about breast&#xD;
      reconstruction surgery. Researchers have created a computer app for breast reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery patients that presents images of breast reconstruction outcomes that are customized&#xD;
      to the individual patient's treatment options and personal preferences. This decision aid app&#xD;
      may help educate patients about how they might look after surgery and answer their questions.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate a newly-developed computer application designed to facilitate shared decision&#xD;
      making about breast reconstruction for practicability and usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of the decision aid application measured as the patient's&#xD;
      decisional conflict, decision regret, and psychosocial well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the accuracy of predicted breast reconstruction outcomes to enhance the&#xD;
      mathematical and physics-based algorithms for future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate patients' aesthetic measures, such as symmetry, breast volume, breast contour&#xD;
      and ptosis 3 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive newly-developed educational materials about breast reconstruction and&#xD;
      attend an enhanced consultation visit with their plastic surgeon to discuss options for&#xD;
      breast reconstruction surgery, during which a decision aid application containing a&#xD;
      customized presentation of possible breast reconstruction outcomes is presented. At the end&#xD;
      of the consultation visit, patients complete questionnaires about decision-making and&#xD;
      psychological well-being. Within 4-6 weeks and 3-6 months after beginning the reconstruction&#xD;
      process, patients also complete questionnaires about satisfaction with their breasts, body&#xD;
      image, and psychological well-being, and undergo two-dimensional (2D) and 3D imaging of the&#xD;
      torso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive newly-developed educational materials about breast reconstruction&#xD;
      and attend a standard of care consultation visit with their plastic surgeon to discuss&#xD;
      options for breast reconstruction surgery. At the end of the consultation visit, patients&#xD;
      complete questionnaires about decision-making and psychological well-being. Within 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      and 3-6 months after beginning the reconstruction process, patients also complete&#xD;
      questionnaires about satisfaction with their breasts, body image, and psychological&#xD;
      well-being, and undergo 2D and 3D imaging of the torso.&#xD;
