    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 20 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BCVA will be measured using the set of three Precision vision^TM or Lighthouse distance acuity charts [modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Charts 1, 2 and R] at a starting distance of 4 meters (m) prior to dilating eyes by trained and certified personnel at the study sites and at each study visit. BCVA letter score has values ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best attainable score. An increase in the BCVA letter score from baseline indicates an improvement in visual acuity. The primary analysis will be done using Linear Mixed Effects Model for Repeated Measurements (MMRM) method.</description>
