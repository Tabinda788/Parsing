  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of stretching techniques in the sports world is frequent and widely used for its many&#xD;
      effects. One of the main benefits is the gain in flexibility, range of motion and&#xD;
      facilitation of the sporting performance. Recently the use of self-myofascial release (SMR)&#xD;
      has spread in sports practice both at elite and recreational level for its benefits being&#xD;
      similar to those observed in stretching. The objective of the following study is to compare&#xD;
      the results of the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching with SMR on the&#xD;
      hamstring muscle flexibility.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluated with a modified sit-and-reach test (MSR). The participants sit on the floor with their lower limbs stretched out and together, their backs and hips are supported against the wall (90° hip flexion), and the soles of their feet are placed against the edge of a box. Participants then extended their arms forward, placing the same hand on top of the other with both hands facing down. During this, they keep their backs against the wall. They then reach forward, sliding their hands along the measuring scale as far as possible without bending their knees</description>

    <description>A PNF stretching protocol will be performed with each participant assuming a long sitting position on a plinth with the knee maintained as extended as possible. At this moment, the participant will be asked to perform a maximum isometric hamstring muscle contraction for 5 seconds followed by 5 seconds of relaxation and 20 seconds of stretching. The therapist will show the participant how to maintain this isometric contraction with the flexion of the hip and ankle. Each participant will undergo 4 repetitions of PNF stretching (30 seconds/rep).</description>

    <description>For the application of self-myofascial release, the subjects will assume a long sitting position on a firm and even surface by placing the arms backward and transferring their body weight to their palms. The roller foam, applied bilaterally, will be placed under the hamstrings and slowly moved back and forth from the ischial tuberosity to the popliteal fossa by applying pressure for 2 minutes.</description>
