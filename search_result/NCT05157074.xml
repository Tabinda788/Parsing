  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study (18-89 years) with Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease&#xD;
      receive drum classes twice a week for 12 weeks (24 lessons). All participants also&#xD;
      participate in study visits for assessments before the beginning of the study, at the 6 week&#xD;
      mark, at the 12 week mark and at the 18 week mark so that the investigators can assess the&#xD;
      short and long term effects of drum classes on hand dexterity, upper extremity function and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been evidence that rhythm-based music therapy interventions may improve motor&#xD;
      outcomes for patients with Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, as well as quality&#xD;
      of life for both patients and the patients' caregivers. DRUM-PD, a pilot study investigating&#xD;
      the impact of West African drumming on quality of life, symptoms, motor findings, cognition,&#xD;
      and mood in Parkinson's disease, found trends toward improvement in walking from baseline to&#xD;
      12 weeks and improved quality of life for patients who completed the 6 week drumming&#xD;
      intervention. Building on this research, the investigators plan to evaluate the impact of a&#xD;
      12-week, twice weekly rhythm-based music therapy intervention called The Armstrong Rhythm&#xD;
      Cycleâ„ , implemented by a board-certified music therapist. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      participation in 24 bi-weekly, hour-long music therapy drumming sessions will result in&#xD;
      improved motor functioning for patients and better quality of life for patients and the&#xD;
      patients' caregivers as compared to baseline before the intervention.&#xD;

It is scored as either (0) never, (1) rarely, (2) sometimes, (3) quite frequently, or (4) nearly always.

    <description>Beck-Depression inventory (BDI-II) measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. Each of the 21 items corresponding to a symptom of depression is summed to give a single score for the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).&#xD;
There is a four-point scale for each item ranging from 0 to 3. On two items (16 and 18) there are seven options to indicate either an increase or decrease of appetite and sleep. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health.&#xD;
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.&#xD;
The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>All 24 Armstrong Rhythm Cycleâ„¢ sessions is conducted in a circle to ensure maximum line of sight for each participant. A variety of diverse percussion instruments ranging from hand drums, stick drums, shakers, and rhythm sticks are available as well as adaptive measures to address limited physical functioning. Instrument choice is dependent on ease of use for the level of the physical ability, skill development needs, and personal choice. Participants are informed that they are free to use the same instrument for the duration of each session or to switch instruments at any time.&#xD;
Utilizing the five components of The Armstrong Rhythm Method, this protocol guides participants through three phases to achieve rhythmic skill development and group cohesion for their therapeutic benefit.</description>
