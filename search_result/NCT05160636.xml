  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic elicited broad medical, economic, and social consequences. There is limited&#xD;
      research and outstanding data gaps related to understanding the impact of long-term effect of&#xD;
      COVID-19 on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Work Productivity and Activity&#xD;
      Impairment (WPAI) in the outpatient settings in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on the evolution of recovery of daily function and the return to the level of&#xD;
      health enjoyed by outpatients prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection will inform the overall&#xD;
      estimation of the benefits of vaccines (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] and indirect cost&#xD;
      saving) in COVID-19 health economics models.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-intervention (NI) prospective longitudinal participant reported outcome (PRO)&#xD;
      study on adults who consented to participate in the PRO study on HRQoL and WPAI. To be&#xD;
      eligible for the enrollment, participants would have at least one self-reported ARI symptom&#xD;
      and RT-PCR test positive confirmation&#xD;
