  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive and physical function impairments are common in patients diagnosed with Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Research has shown that cognitive and physical exercise&#xD;
      training may be a beneficial strategy to improve physical and cognitive performance in COPD&#xD;
      patients; however, interventions combining physical and cognitive training have not been&#xD;
      evaluated in this population. The objectives of this research are i) to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of an 8-week home-based cognitive-physical training program in COPD patients; and&#xD;
      ii) to derive preliminary estimates on intervention efficacy with cognitive-physical training&#xD;
      on dual-task performance, physical function, activities of daily living, and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life. Related to our research objectives, we hypothesize that i) it will be&#xD;
      feasible to safely recruit COPD patients into a home-based cognitive physical training&#xD;
      program with 75% adherence and high satisfaction ratings with the prescribed training; and&#xD;
      that ii) the combination of cognitive and physical training will be superior to physical&#xD;
      training alone for improving dual-task and cognitive performance, physical function,&#xD;
      activities of daily living, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective study of 24 patients diagnosed with moderate to severe COPD recruited from&#xD;
      clinics at the University Health Network (Toronto, Canada). All study assessments and&#xD;
      interventions will be performed remotely from the participants' homes. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of the following groups and stratified by sex: i)&#xD;
      Cognitive-Physical Training (C-PT) group: home-based cognitive training (60 minutes, 5 times&#xD;
      per week, using the BrainHQ platform) and physical training (5 days of aerobic training and 2&#xD;
      days of strength training per week); ii) Physical Training (PT) group: physical exercise&#xD;
      training alone. Study participants will have weekly follow-up video calls with the study team&#xD;
      to review training plans. Intervention feasibility will be evaluated through recruitment&#xD;
      rate, program adherence, satisfaction, and assessment of adverse events. Efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention will be assessed via cognitive performance tests (BrainHQ), dual-task&#xD;
      performance test (i.e., spelling backwards while peddling), physical fitness assessments&#xD;
      (i.e., lower body strength, aerobic endurance, and physical function), physical activity&#xD;
      levels (i.e., Fitbit, physical activity questionnaire), self-reported measures of dyspnea,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, exercise self-efficacy, and mood.&#xD;
      Participants will have repeat assessments after 4 and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training to improve cognitive performance has shown to be successful in adults with different&#xD;
      neurologic conditions, but has not been evaluated in COPD. The assessment of feasibility and&#xD;
      effect estimates of home-based cognitive-physical training will serve as an important&#xD;
      catalyst in the development of future clinical trials aimed at reducing the morbidity&#xD;
      associated with cognitive and physical impairments in COPD.&#xD;

Aerobic training will be performed 5 times per week using a foot peddler for a minimum of 30 minutes at a moderate intensity (Borg Exertion Scale: between 4 and 6; pedaling speed: 50 RPM). Strength training will be performed 2 times per week, with 1-3 sets of 10-12 repetitions per exercise. Strength exercises will include training with resistance bands and bodyweight exercises. Participants will be instructed to reduce the intensity of their training if they reach a score of 7 on the Borg Exertion Scale, if oxygen saturation is less than 85%, or if they experience any symptoms. Exercise prescriptions will be developed and monitored by an exercise professional with weekly follow-up meetings and supported with a web application (Physiotec) that allows customizable exercise prescriptions, tracking of exercise completion, and video tutorials.</description>

    <description>Eight weeks of home-based cognitive and physical training. Cognitive training sessions will be performed 5 times per week using the Brain HQ platform (Posit Science; San Francisco, CA, USA) and will have a duration of 60 minutes. The cognitive training program will be tailored by using the Personal Trainer function which presents an automated sequence of exercise levels to participants based on selected exercises. Participants will have identical sessions initially, but schedules will diverge as participants progress and as the algorithm considers their individual performance history. The Personal Trainer program will be customized to the abilities of each user and will include a focus on the following domains: sustained attention, executive function, short and long-term memory, and anxiety and depression. Participants in this group will also engage in the same exercise training intervention as participants in the Physical Training group.</description>
