  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, surgery has been the standard recommendation for treating papillary thyroid&#xD;
      cancer. The risk of surgery including permanent hoarseness, permanent hypocalcemia, a&#xD;
      mid-cervical scar, and the potential for permanent hypothyroidism may be unacceptable for&#xD;
      some patients, especially with low risk papillary thyroid carcinoma. The recent American&#xD;
      Thyroid Association guidelines have proposed the option of active surveillance with low risk&#xD;
      papillary thyroid cancer less than 210 mm. However, most patients find observation anxiety&#xD;
      provoking knowing of having cancer. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of small low risk papillary&#xD;
      thyroid cancer is a promising therapeutic modality for these patients that reduces the risks&#xD;
      associated with surgery and the anxiety of taking a watchful approach. However, this&#xD;
      technique has not been validated in the North American population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to describe the investigators' initial experience with RFA of low risk&#xD;
      papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) compared to active surveillance (AS) done by Head and&#xD;
      Neck Endocrine surgeons at Johns Hopkins Medical Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety, efficacy and oncological outcomes of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the patient functional outcomes in comparison to the observational control.&#xD;
