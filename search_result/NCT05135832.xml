  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of PRORECECA is to test whether adding weekly active patient-reported outcomes to&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma can improve patient-reported&#xD;
      physical function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRORECECA is a two-armed randomized controlled trial for patients with metastatic renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma initiating 1st or 2nd line of standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either receiving questions from Patient-Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE™) with a&#xD;
      specifically developed alert-algorithm and the European Organization for the Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) or receiving standard&#xD;
      procedure regarding side effect registration and handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that weekly active patient-reported outcomes in the intervention group can&#xD;
      improve physical function 30% compared to the group who receive standard care and standard&#xD;
      handling of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 174 patients will be included with 87 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is physical function reported by the patient after 3 months of treatment.&#xD;
      The patients will assess their physical function by completing the EORTC QLQ-C30.&#xD;

    <description>This arm will be assigned to intervention by weekly electronic reporting of symptoms and side effects in an app. A specifically developed alert-algorithm will in real-time guide the patient to adjust supportive care or contact the hospital.&#xD;
The reported symptoms are sent to the hospital to a healthcare professional - depending on the severity of the reported symptoms the healthcare professional can schedule a visit at the clinic.&#xD;
The patient will also receive a health-related quality of life questionnaire (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) including the Physical Function domain in the app each month.&#xD;
Patient satisfaction regarding the patient-reported outcomes will be measured with the validated Patient-Reported Experience Measurement questionnaire at termination of participation.</description>
