  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare open and minimally invasive pancreatic and liver&#xD;
      resection techniques and analyze the different outcome variables from the clinical&#xD;
      standpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to investigate patient survival, length of stay, complication rates, operative&#xD;
      time, transfusion rate, 30 and 90-day readmission rate, and hospital charges.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to conduct a retrospective chart review of patients who have undergone pancreatic&#xD;
      and liver resection by using Meditech and Epic. A non-identified database will be created&#xD;
      after retrospectively reviewing each patient case involving pancreatic or liver resection at&#xD;
      MDMC. The study period will start in January 2006 until October 31, 2017. Variables will&#xD;
      include demographics, clinical disease diagnoses, and operative parameters as well as&#xD;
      indirect charges from the hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT SELECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that have undergone pancreatic or liver resection surgeries from January 2006&#xD;
           until October 31, 2017 at Methodist Dallas Medical Center (MDMC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years old or older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that have not undergone pancreatic resection surgeries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients under 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature Termination or suspension of study This study may be suspended or prematurely&#xD;
      terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification documenting the&#xD;
      reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating&#xD;
      party. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the principal investigator will&#xD;
      promptly inform the IRB and will provide the reason(s) for suspension or termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of futility&#xD;
