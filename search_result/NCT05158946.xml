  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Future-oriented Group&#xD;
      training aimed at reducing suicidality in adults. This will test the effectiveness by&#xD;
      studying the effect on suicidal ideation and related outcomes, compared to Treatment As&#xD;
      Usual. Participants will also be asked to evaluate the group training. The study is a&#xD;
      multicentre randomized controlled trial conducted in out-patient Flemish mental healthcare&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;

    <description>A 21-item self-report questionnaire to measure (the severity of) suicidal ideation in adolescents and adults. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 2, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 38, with higher scores indicating more (severe) suicidal ideation.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (2 weeks before the intervention), posttest (9 weeks after start of intervention), follow-up (3 months after the end of the intervention)</time_frame>

    <description>A 20-item self-report questionnaire to measure hopelessness in adolescents and adults. Each item is rated as 'true' (score = 1) or 'false' (score = 0) for them over the past week, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating higher levels of hopelessness.</description>

    <description>A 22-item self-report questionnaire to measure repeated thinking about the future, specifically about the likelihood of negative and positive events happening. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 3 (&quot;almost always&quot;).</description>

    <description>Rating of the general training (score ranging from 0 to 10) and 10 statements about several aspects of the format, content and effect of the group training. Of these statements, 4 were rated on a 3-point Likert scale, and 6 on a 5-point likert scale</description>

The sessions, which lasted one and a half hours each, were each led by one trainer.</description>
