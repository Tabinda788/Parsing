  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of a social&#xD;
      media-based text messaging smoking cessation intervention targeting Chinese immigrant smokers&#xD;
      in New York City (NYC). For Aim 1, the study team will develop a message library for the&#xD;
      WeChat Quit Coach smoking cessation program and conduct in-depth interviews with 20 Chinese&#xD;
      immigrant smokers in person to assess content relevance. For Aim 2, a two-arm, open-labeled,&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the WeChat Quit Coach intervention among 50 Chinese immigrant smokers.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to intervention (n=25) or control group (n=25). Participants&#xD;
      in the intervention group will receive a 6-week WeChat Quit Coach intervention through WeChat&#xD;
      private group. Participants in the control group will receive a weekly 1-item WeChat text&#xD;
      assessment on smoking status for 6 weeks. All the 50 participants will be offered a 4-week&#xD;
      supple of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patches and lozenge. Participants will complete&#xD;
      a baseline in-person survey at enrollment and a 6-week follow-up phone survey immediately&#xD;
      after the intervention. Biochemical test (exhaled carbon monoxide test) will be conducted to&#xD;
      confirm abstinence among those who report no smoking in past 7-day at 6-week follow-up&#xD;
      survey. Post-test in-depth interviews will be conducted with 15 participants in person from&#xD;
      the intervention group to obtain more information about the usability and perceptions about&#xD;
      the WeChat Quit Coach program.&#xD;

    <description>WeChat Quit Coach intervention will be delivered via WeChat private groups for 6 weeks (&lt;5 minutes per day). During the intervention period, participants will receive a text message at a fixed point of time every day (e.g., 8:00 am). The messages are designed to build motivations and skillset to quit smoking. Participants will also receive a daily group discussion question (e.g., &quot;If you are to give one piece of advice to someone who has not made the decision to quit smoking, what would you say to his/her?&quot;), and be encouraged to respond to the question. Participants can comment on group members' responses and ask questions related to smoking and quitting either in group (so everyone in the group can see the message) or directly to the coach (so only the coach can see the message). The coach will respond to the questions within 24 hours. The PI and the RA will moderate group discussions.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will receive a 1-item text assessment on smoking status (i.e., &quot;During the past 7 days, on how many days did you smoke?&quot;) at a fixed point of time every week (e.g., 8:00 pm on Sunday) via WeChat.&#xD;
Participants in both groups will be offered a 4-week supply of NRT patches and lozenge but not forced to use the medications. The medications are free to participants. If participants want to try or use the medications, we will mail the patches and lozenge (with a Chinese version of the instruction) or deliver in person.</description>
