      The study investigates the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in the treatment of keloids&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current scar treatments have limited efficacy and are often unsatisfactory although over $20&#xD;
      billion dollars are spent annually on the treatment and management of scars. Keloids, an&#xD;
      abnormal proliferation of scar tissue, can be disfiguring, functionally impairing, and have&#xD;
      dramatic impacts on quality of life. Treatments of keloids include a variety of modalities&#xD;
      (i.e. intralesional steroid injections, silicone gel or sheets, surgery, laser, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, cryotherapy, topical imiquimod, and intralesional 5-fluorouracil injections).&#xD;
      However, current treatments are limited to primarily localized interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that dupilumab can decrease the size and symptoms of keloids&#xD;
      and improve patient's quality of life. An open-label proof of concept study regarding the use&#xD;
      of dupilumab in patients with keloids may be the first step in elucidating a novel systematic&#xD;
      approach to treatment of keloids.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine changes in Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) from baseline to week 24.&#xD;
The POSAS measures scar quality by evaluating visual (e.g. color), tactile (e.g. pliability) and sensory (e.g. itch) characteristics of the scar from the perspective of the observer (investigator) and patients. POSAS is comprised of two numeric scales: the Patient Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS, patient scale measuring pain, pruritus, color, stiffness, thickness, bumpiness) and the Observer Scar Assessment Scale (OSAS, observer scale measuring vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, surface area). Both scales contain six items that are scored numerically on a 1-10 scale. A score of &quot;1&quot; being &quot;no, not at all&quot; and a score of &quot;10&quot; being &quot;yes, very much&quot;. Together, they make up the total score (range of 12-120) of the PSAS (range of 6-60) and OSAS (range of 6-60).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>24weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine changes in Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) from baseline to week 24.&#xD;
Score Description:&#xD;
The VSS measures four parameters of scars: vascularity, pigmentation, pliability, and height. Each parameter contained ranked subscales that may be summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 (representing normal skin) to 13 (representing worst scar imaginable).&#xD;
Vascularity: assessed by looking at the scar at resting and by blanching the scar and observing the rate and amount of blood return&#xD;
Score 0: normal color and capillary refill&#xD;
Score 1: pink scar with a slight increase in the local blood supply&#xD;
Score 2: red scar with a significant increase in the local blood supply&#xD;
Score 3: purple scar with excess local blood supply, scars which are congested and refill slowly or cannot be completely blanched&#xD;
Pigmentation: The skin will be blanched with a piece of plastic to eliminate the effect of vascularity on skin color and compared with normal skin (Score: 0-3)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).</measure>
    <time_frame>24weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine changes of patient-reported outcomes based on Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).&#xD;
Score Description:&#xD;
A Quality of Life Score will be calculated based upon the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).&#xD;
The DLQI is a validated general dermatology questionnaire that consists of 10 items that assess subject health-related quality of life (daily activities, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment) (Appendix 3)12. It has been extensively used in dermatology clinical trials for atopic dermatitis. The DLQI is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument that has been translated into several languages, and the DLQI total scores have been shown to be responsive to change. The minimally important difference for the DLQI has been estimated as a 2 to 5 point change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Cutometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Screening, weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24</time_frame>
    <description>To determine objective changes of pigmentation, erythema and pliability using by Cutometer from baseline to week 24.&#xD;
Device Description:&#xD;
The Cutometer is the device to measure elastic properties of the scars which was most frequently used in the studies for scars. This device can provide objective measurement for pliability in addition to POSAS and VSS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mexameter</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Screening, weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24</time_frame>
    <description>To determine objective changes of pigmentation, erythema and pliability using by Mexameter from baseline to week 24.&#xD;
Device Description:&#xD;
The Mexameter specifically measures the content of melanin (pigmentation) and only hemoglobin (erythema) in the skin. These two components are largely responsible for the skin color.</description>
