  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled pilot trial is to develop and test mobile app,&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit-Caregiver Activation Response, and Engagement (ICU-CARE). ICU-CARE&#xD;
      provides a simulated learning environment to encourage family caregivers of mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients to assess two patient symptoms, thirst and anxiety, and perform specific&#xD;
      nonpharmacologic comfort measures to help alleviate patient symptom burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical care guidelines call for the liberal inclusion of family caregivers into bedside&#xD;
      care, but despite convincing evidence that active family participation improves the patient&#xD;
      and family experience as well as safety, quality, and delivery of care, critical care nurses&#xD;
      have few evidence-based strategies to engage family caregivers as active participants in the&#xD;
      provision of care in the intensive care unit (ICU). The broad objective of this proposal is&#xD;
      to develop and test a mobile app, Intensive Care Unit-Caregiver Activation Response and&#xD;
      Engagement [ICU-CARE]. ICU-CARE provides a simulated learning environment that incorporates&#xD;
      established motivational learning theories to encourage family caregivers of mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients to assess two patient symptoms, thirst and anxiety, and perform specific&#xD;
      nonpharmacologic symptom management techniques to help alleviate the patient's symptom&#xD;
      burden. This project, guided by the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory, aims to (1)&#xD;
      Establish the feasibility and acceptability of the ICU-CARE intervention for family&#xD;
      caregivers enrolled in the experimental arm; and (2) Determine the influence of the ICU-CARE&#xD;
      intervention on the caregiver process characteristics, proximal caregiving outcomes, and&#xD;
      distal caregiving outcomes as compared to family caregivers enrolled in the control arm. To&#xD;
      address these study aims, a convenience sample of 60 family caregivers of mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients will be recruited into this randomized controlled pilot trial. 30&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled to the control group which will receive usual care with routine&#xD;
      caregiver support practices. Intervention participants (n=30) will be enrolled to an&#xD;
      experimental condition ICU-CARE, that will consist of a theoretically grounded mobile app&#xD;
      program to promote caregiver engagement in symptom assessment and management in the ICU. This&#xD;
      project will help further define the scope, extent, and nature of patient and family&#xD;
      engagement in the ICU, and if proven feasible, our intervention holds the potential to shift&#xD;
      the ICU nursing practice paradigm by integrating family caregivers as dynamic partners in ICU&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <description>The caregiver gets access to use the app. Each day, investigators will ask the patient to rate their thirst and anxiety and the caregiver to answer daily measures through the application. The caregiver will be asked questions at 3 different times: Day 1, 24-48 hours after enrollment, and 2-4 weeks after the patient is discharged from the ICU. The caregiver will be taught how to use the app. The caregiver will be given the supplies that the caregiver needs to perform the symptom management intervention. Investigators will ask the caregiver to use the app at least once a day, but the caregiver can use it as much as desired while the patient is in the ICU.</description>
