      The aim of this study is to present results on the effect of lightened and musical baby&#xD;
      mobile on sleep quality in children hospitalized in the pediatric emergency clinic. In the&#xD;
      randomized controlled study, 124 children hospitalized in the pediatric emergency clinic of a&#xD;
      public hospital and appropriate the inclusion criteria were equally divided into 2 groups.&#xD;
      The lightened and musical baby mobile was used during the night's sleep in the patient's room&#xD;
      of the children in the first group (intervention group). The children in the second group&#xD;
      (control group) did not use a lightened and musical baby mobile. The sleep quality of the&#xD;
      children in the 2 groups was evaluated with the Child's Sleep Quality Evaluation Form&#xD;
      (CSQEF).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Illness, hospital environment, hospitalization and routines; are common sources of stress&#xD;
      experienced by children. This experience; delays the child's recovery process and&#xD;
      growth-development, impairs play activity and sleep quality. The aim of this randomized&#xD;
      controlled study is to present results on the effect of lightened and musical baby mobile on&#xD;
      sleep quality in children hospitalized in the pediatric emergency clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This study was conducted in a single-center, prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      design. The sample size of the study was calculated in the program of G* Power 3.1.9.2&#xD;
      (Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany). The sample size was found to be 60 children&#xD;
      for each group. The study authors considered possible sample losses during the study process.&#xD;
      It was decided to conduct the study with a total of 124 children. There were 62 children in&#xD;
      each group (intervention and control group). This study included 150 children hospitalized in&#xD;
      a 6-bed pediatric emergency clinic of a public hospital in Istanbul between October and&#xD;
      December 2019. Of these children, 124 children who met the inclusion criteria were included&#xD;
      in the study. Children who were transferred to other inpatient units after hospitalization in&#xD;
      the emergency department (n=18) and whose parents refused to participate in the study (n=8)&#xD;
      were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assigning the participants to the groups, positioning and operating the lightened and musical&#xD;
      baby mobile in the child's room, taking vital signs, collecting the data in the CSQEF and all&#xD;
      recordings were made by the first researcher. The first researcher has 5 years of experience&#xD;
      as a pediatric emergency nurse. In the pediatric emergency clinic, nurses work in 2 shifts&#xD;
      (08:00-17:00 and 16:00-08:00). The first investigator works in the pediatric emergency&#xD;
      clinic. In this study, the following procedure was applied, respectively. Each child admitted&#xD;
      to the pediatric emergency clinic was taken to the patient's room with his mother, his&#xD;
      clinical status was evaluated, and the children to be included in the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups were determined. Parents of the children included in the intervention group&#xD;
      were informed about all stages of the research process, and their verbal and written consents&#xD;
      were obtained. Assignment of children to groups was done by simple randomization method&#xD;
      (according to their hospitalization on odd and even number days of the calendar). Children&#xD;
      who were hospitalized on odd-numbered days of the calendar were included in the intervention&#xD;
      group, and children hospitalized on even-numbered days were included in the control group.&#xD;
      For example; The child admitted to the pediatric emergency clinic on October 11 was included&#xD;
      in the intervention group, and the child hospitalized on October 12 was included in the&#xD;
      control group. This sequence was repeated until the number of samples was completed. In this&#xD;
      study, all assessments were made in the same way for the children in the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups. In this study, data on children's sleep quality and vitals signs were&#xD;
      re-evaluated in different time periods. These time periods are: pre-intervention and&#xD;
      intervention day. Intervention day; in the morning (at 08:00), before going to sleep (at&#xD;
      20:00), during sleep (at 02:00), and the next morning (at 08:00). Before the intervention; It&#xD;
      covers between at 08:00 in the morning the day before the child is admitted to the emergency&#xD;
      clinic and at 08:00 in the morning on the day the child is admitted to the emergency clinic.&#xD;
      Intervention day; It covers the first day of the child's admission to the emergency clinic&#xD;
      between at 08:00 in the morning and at 08:00 in the next day. Factors defining the sleep&#xD;
      quality of children; It was evaluated twice, before the intervention and on the day of the&#xD;
      intervention. Children's vital signs, intervention day; It was measured 4 times ( in the&#xD;
      morning, before going to sleep, during sleep and the next morning), using a pulse oximetry&#xD;
      device and an infrared thermometer. All data, except the vital signs of the children, were&#xD;
      asked to the mothers face-to-face and their answers were recorded in the CSQEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected with the Child's Sleep Quality Evaluation Form (CSQEF). CSQEF was&#xD;
      developed by the authors based on the literature. The questions in the form; The child's age,&#xD;
      gender, vital signs (blood pressure, radial pulse, respiratory rate and body temperature) and&#xD;
      factors indicating sleep quality ( night sleep duration/hour and night awakenings/number). In&#xD;
      the study, a lightened and musical baby mobile, which facilitates the falling asleep of&#xD;
      children and allows them to continue their sleep, was used in the rooms of the children in&#xD;
      the hospital. In the study, In the study, a lightened and musical baby that can be hung on&#xD;
      the wall and fixed on a flat surface was used. An illuminated musical mobile with light&#xD;
      emitting diode (LED) lights and a reflective interior surface, providing night sky projection&#xD;
      on the ceiling and walls, with 5 different color options, 4 function keys and soft music, was&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in the intervention and control groups, who were admitted to the pediatric emergency&#xD;
      clinic, were monitored by being connected to the pulse oximeter device located at the&#xD;
      bedside. Vital signs were measured and recorded first thing in the morning (at 08:00) on the&#xD;
      intervention day. The child's age, gender, and factors defining sleep quality before the&#xD;
      intervention (1st evaluation) were asked face-to-face to the mothers and their answers were&#xD;
      recorded in the CSQEF. At 19:00, a mobile with light and music was placed in the middle of&#xD;
      the bedside table in the room of the children in the intervention group. Checked the volume,&#xD;
      lighting color, pattern and rotation function. Sound; set to medium level, which facilitates&#xD;
      the transition to sleep. lighting color; set to a yellow color that provides dim light and is&#xD;
      not distracting. As a pattern; Reminiscent of the night, the moon-star projection and&#xD;
      rotation function were used.The patient room of the children in the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups was illuminated and the window blinds were closed to provide a dark environment. Vital&#xD;
      signs of the children in the intervention and control groups were measured and recorded at&#xD;
      20:00. The mobile with light and music placed in the room of the children in the intervention&#xD;
      group was started at 20:00. The children in the control group did not use lightened and&#xD;
      musical baby mobile, and the routine sleep pattern was maintained. Children in the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups at 02:00 (during sleep) and 08:00; Vital signs were measured&#xD;
      and recorded. The next morning on the intervention day (at 08:00); The mothers in the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups were asked face-to-face about the factors that define the&#xD;
      sleep quality of the children in the intervention and control groups between at 20:00 and&#xD;
      08:00 (2nd evaluation) and that their impair (1st evaluation) and their answers were recorded&#xD;
      in the CSQEF.&#xD;
