    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NDI-034858 in&#xD;
      subjects with active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, Randomized, Multi-center, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multiple Dose&#xD;
      Study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to one of the treatments with NDI-034858 Dose 1, 2, 3 or placebo once daily&#xD;
      (QD) will be based on a 1:1:1:1:1 scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum study duration per subject is approximately 20 weeks, including up to 30 days for&#xD;
      the screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and a 4-week safety follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed using the ACR20 composite measure (including tender and swollen&#xD;
      joint count, patient assessment of PsA pain visual analog scale (VAS), patient global PsA&#xD;
      assessment VAS, physician global PsA assessment, HAQ-DI, and hsCRP) as well as the additional&#xD;
      components. Efficacy for psoriasis among subjects who have ≥ 3% BSA) involvement on Day 1,&#xD;
      will be measured using PASI, PGAs, and BSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by collecting AEs, recording vital signs, performing physical&#xD;
      examinations, and evaluating clinical laboratory and ECGs results.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has positive results for hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg), antibodies to&#xD;
             hepatitis B core antigens (anti-HBc), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Samples testing positive for HCV antibodies will require&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) qualitative testing for HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has clinical or laboratory evidence of active or latent TB infection at&#xD;
             screening as assessed by QuantiFERON-TB Gold (or a purified protein derivative [PPD]&#xD;
             skin test or equivalent, or both if required per local guidelines) and chest X-ray.&#xD;
             The PPD skin test should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test is not&#xD;
             possible for any reason (unless local guidelines require both tests). Chest X-ray may&#xD;
             be taken at screening or completed within 3 months prior to the screening visit, with&#xD;
             documentation showing no evidence of infection or malignancy as read by a qualified&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a known or suspected allergy to NDI-034858 or any component of the&#xD;
             investigational product, or any other significant drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or&#xD;
             hepatotoxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a known history of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse in the&#xD;
             last year prior to baseline (Day 1).&#xD;
