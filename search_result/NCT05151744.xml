      Study BP43464 is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-masked active&#xD;
      comparator-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of RO7200220 in combination with,&#xD;
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, ranibizumab compared with&#xD;
      ranibizumab alone in participants with diabetic macular edema. Only one eye will be chosen as&#xD;
      the study eye. The duration of the study will be 52 weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 20 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BCVA will be measured using the set of three Precision vision^TM or Lighthouse distance acuity charts [modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Charts 1, 2 and R] at a starting distance of 4 meters (m) prior to dilating eyes by trained and certified personnel at the study sites and at each study visit. BCVA letter score has values ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best attainable score. An increase in the BCVA letter score from baseline indicates an improvement in visual acuity.
