  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if tucatinib works better than placebo when given with other&#xD;
      drugs to treat participants with HER2-positive breast cancer. A placebo is a pill that looks&#xD;
      the same as tucatinib but has no medicine in it. This study will also test what side effects&#xD;
      happen when participants take this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything a drug&#xD;
      does to the body besides treating your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have cancer that has spread in the body near where it started (locally&#xD;
      advanced) and cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all participants will get either tucatinib or placebo. Participants will be&#xD;
      assigned randomly to a group. This is a blinded study, so patients and their doctors will not&#xD;
      know which group a participant is in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also get trastuzumab and pertuzumab. These are 2 drugs used to treat&#xD;
      this type of cancer.&#xD;

      Control arm: Placebo given orally twice daily plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental arm: Tucatinib 300 mg given orally twice daily plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab&#xD;
      every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab and pertuzumab will be administered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Trastuzumab will be given intravenously (IV) at a dose of 6 mg/kg or subcutaneously (SC) at&#xD;
      a fixed dose of 600 mg, once every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pertuzumab will be given IV at 420 mg every 21 days. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fixed dose combination of 600 mg pertuzumab, 600 mg trastuzumab, and 20,000 units&#xD;
           hyaluronidase will be given SC, once every 21 days, in lieu of trastuzumab and&#xD;
           pertuzumab individually.&#xD;
