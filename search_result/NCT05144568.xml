      The aim of our study is to examine the effect of nutritional education given to university&#xD;
      students with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) on premenstrual symptom severity, nutrient intake&#xD;
      and anthropometric measures. Our hypothesis is that nutrition education reduces symptoms in&#xD;
      students with PMS. The effect of nutrition education on premenstrual syndrome was evaluated.&#xD;
      The sample for this study included 83 female students, with 43 in the experimental and 40 in&#xD;
      the control group, who were studying at the health sciences faculty of a state university and&#xD;
      met the inclusion criteria. Experimental and control groups were formed by randomized method.&#xD;
      Nutrition training was given to the experimental group. Participant data were collected&#xD;
      before and four months after nutrition training. The data were collected with the personal&#xD;
      information form, Premenstrual Syndrome Scale and food consumption record form. Nutrient&#xD;
      amounts were determined in the Nutrition Information System (BEBİS) program.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a condition in which physical, psychological&#xD;
           and emotional symptoms related to the menstrual cycle of women are seen together. These&#xD;
           symptoms experienced by many women occur before menstruation and disappear with&#xD;
           menstrual bleeding. Imbalance in estrogen and progesterone levels, stress and&#xD;
           malnutrition are among the factors affecting PMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PMS, which has many symptoms such as changes in appetite, increased body weight,&#xD;
           abdominal pain, back pain, headache, breast swelling and sensitivity, irritability, and&#xD;
           fatigue, has incidence in Turkey in the range of 58.1% to 91.8%. It is known that&#xD;
           individuals who do not exercise regularly, eat too much salt and sugar, and have high&#xD;
           stress levels experience more PMS symptoms. While the presence of PMS in women causes an&#xD;
           increase in health expenditures, loss of labor and low quality of life, in addition to&#xD;
           these, it causes low concentration, absenteeism from school and academic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The etiology of premenstrual syndrome is not fully known, but one of the most emphasized&#xD;
           reasons is hormone imbalance. Since the pathophysiology of PMS is not known exactly, the&#xD;
           aim is to alleviate the severity of the symptoms during treatment of this syndrome.&#xD;
           Non-pharmacological treatment methods such as exercise and diet are used. Studies&#xD;
           reported that there is a positive relationship between increasing body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
           and the risk of PMS. The incidence and severity of PMS is accepted to increase with&#xD;
           simple carbohydrate consumption, and the aim is to reduce simple carbohydrate&#xD;
           consumption and increase complex carbohydrate and fiber consumption in the treatment of&#xD;
           PMS. It is reported that the consumption of foods with high fat content is a diet that&#xD;
           increases the severity of PMS. Excessive consumption of salt, sugar, caffeine and&#xD;
           alcohol negatively affects PMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Studies conducted so far revealed various causes of PMS, and the effect of malnutrition&#xD;
           on the etiology of PMS was mentioned. However, there are a few studies on providing&#xD;
           nutrition training to individuals with PMS. Studies were conducted to show that&#xD;
           excessive consumption of certain foods such as salt, sugar and caffeine, and&#xD;
           insufficient intake of calcium, magnesium, B group vitamins and many other nutrients&#xD;
           increase the severity of PMS. However, studies to reduce the severity of PMS by&#xD;
           providing nutrition training to women with PMS are limited. This study was carried out&#xD;
           to examine the effect of nutritional education given to nursing students studying at&#xD;
           university on premenstrual symptom severity, nutrient intake and anthropometric&#xD;
           measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           H1: Nutrition education has an impact on anthropometric measurements. H2: Nutrition&#xD;
           education affects nutrient intake. H3: Nutrition education is effective in reducing the&#xD;
           severity of premenstrual syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. METHODS 2.1. Participants and Recruitment The population of this randomized controlled&#xD;
           experimental study consisted of 117 female students who scored 111 and higher on the&#xD;
           premenstrual syndrome scale (PMSS). The sample of the study included 83 nursing&#xD;
           students, 43 in the experimental group and 40 in the control group, who agreed to&#xD;
           participate in the study and were eligible for the inclusion criteria. The groups were&#xD;
           created using the randomization technique, and a computer program was used for&#xD;
           randomization (https://www.randomizer.org/). The rate of participation in the research&#xD;
           was 71%. Female students who volunteered to participate in the study, who had regular&#xD;
           menstrual cycles and were over 18 years old were included in the study. Students with&#xD;
           chronic disease, dieting in the last 3 months and using oral contraceptives were&#xD;
           excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for conducting the study with female students is to minimize confounding factors&#xD;
      such as pregnancy, lactation, and the use of oral contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Study Design The first data in the study were collected between June 3 and June 10, 2019&#xD;
      with a questionnaire prepared by the researchers, the Premenstrual Syndrome Scale, and a&#xD;
      24-hour retrospective food consumption record. After the first evaluation, nutrition training&#xD;
      was given to the experimental group, and no intervention was made to the control group.&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements of the participants and a 24-hour retrospective food consumption&#xD;
      record were completed again 4 months after the nutrition training (between September 23 and&#xD;
      September 30, 2019) and PMSS was re-applied. With the information obtained, the effect of&#xD;
      nutrition education on anthropometric measurements, daily nutrients and premenstrual symptom&#xD;
      severity was examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Instruments 2.3.1. Question form. In the questionnaire, there were questions about the&#xD;
      students' age, class of education, current place of residence, anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      including body weight, height, waist and hip circumference, smoking status, exercise status,&#xD;
      coffee and salt consumption, skipping meals status, skipped meals, reason for skipping meals&#xD;
      and what they consumed in the last 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2. Anthropometric measurements. Anthropometric measurements including body weight,&#xD;
      height, waist and hip circumference of the participants were taken. Participant weight was&#xD;
      measured with a portable digital scale in light clothing and without shoes, and height&#xD;
      without shoes was measured with the aid of a meter fixed to the wall with the feet side by&#xD;
      side and on the head Frankfort plane. For the waist circumference measurement, the midpoint&#xD;
      of the lowest rib of the individual and the crista iliac crest were found and the&#xD;
      circumference passing through the midpoint was measured with an inelastic tape measure. Hip&#xD;
      circumference was measured with a non-stretch tape measure at the highest point of the hip&#xD;
      circumference, standing by the side of the participant. BMI was calculated by the ratio of&#xD;
      body weight in kg to the square of height in meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.3. Premenstrual syndrome scale. The Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS), developed by&#xD;
      Gençdoğan20 based on DSM-III and DSM-IVR criteria, consists of 44 questions. The PMSS is&#xD;
      Likert type and its items are scored between 1 and 5 points. Lowest points of 44 and highest&#xD;
      points of 220 can be obtained on the PMSS. The scale has a total of 9 subscales: depressive&#xD;
      feeling, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, depressive thoughts, pain, changes in appetite,&#xD;
      changes in sleeping habits and swelling. A higher score on the scale indicates that the&#xD;
      severity of premenstrual syndrome is high. When the score of the total PMSS and subscales is&#xD;
      higher than 50% of the total score, it is considered to indicate PMS. In the original study,&#xD;
      the Cronbach alpha value for the whole scale was 0.75, in this study the Cronbach alpha value&#xD;
      was 0.90 before nutrition education and 0.96 after the education. For premenstrual syndrome&#xD;
      subscales, the Cronbach alpha values before and after the intervention were depressive&#xD;
      feeling 0.85-0.89, anxiety 0.77-0.86, fatigue 0.81-0.87, irritability 0.88-0.92, depressive&#xD;
      thoughts 0.82-0.91, pain 0.74-0.79, changes in appetite 0.55-0.58, changes in sleeping habits&#xD;
      0.77-0.79 and swelling 0.85-0.81.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Intervention-Nutrition Education In the experimental group, 43 students were divided&#xD;
      into 4 groups, and each group received an hour of nutrition education. The education was&#xD;
      carried out in classrooms where the students were trained, supported by a power point&#xD;
      presentation. Nutritional sources of nutrients were taught, the relationship of some specific&#xD;
      foods such as salt and coffee with premenstrual syndrome, the number of meals, meal time and&#xD;
      importance of body weight control in premenstrual syndrome were emphasized. On the 30th and&#xD;
      60th days after the nutrition education, an e-mail was sent to the participants to inform&#xD;
      them about nutrition in order to reinforce the education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Ethical Issues Before starting the study, permission was obtained from Gençdoğan to use&#xD;
      the PMS scale. In order to conduct the research, permission of the institution was obtained&#xD;
      from Ordu University where the research was conducted (decision dated 26 April 2019 and&#xD;
      numbered ….). Ethics committee approval was obtained from Ordu University Non-Interventional&#xD;
      Clinical Research Ethics Committee (May 23, 2019 and numbered 2019/82). After the&#xD;
      participants were informed about the study, their informed written consent was obtained. In&#xD;
      this study, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed.&#xD;
