  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major public health issue associated with significant morbidities and&#xD;
      mortality. Fixed dose combination (FDC) pills, combining 2 or more classes of&#xD;
      antihypertensive medications have considerable appeal because they may reduce blood pressure&#xD;
      more effectively and efficiently compared to monotherapy. However, because FDC medication&#xD;
      causes 'dyskalemia', the occurrence of either hypo- or hyper-kalemia, which requires&#xD;
      laboratory testing, implementing FDC is hampered in some low- and middle-income countries&#xD;
      where laboratory testing is limited. This study will be conducted in the area of Mirpur in&#xD;
      Dhaka, Bangladesh, to 1) estimate the prevalence of dyskalemia in hypertensive patients who&#xD;
      are candidates for pharmacotherapy; and 2) of those patients initiating a FDC combining&#xD;
      telmisartan 40 mg/amlodipine 5 mg, estimate the incidence of dyskalemia at two months later.&#xD;
      Telmisartan is a widely prescribed drug approved by Directorate General of Drug&#xD;
      Administration (DGDA). If the prevalence and incidence of dyskalemia is low, as anticipated,&#xD;
      our results will provide evidence that routine laboratory testing might not be necessary. It&#xD;
      is to be mentioned that Telmisartan is not a new drug and it is a widely prescribed drug&#xD;
      approved by Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA), Bangladesh&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects an estimated 1.04 billion people in low- and middle-income countries,&#xD;
      with an estimated increase in prevalence of 7.7% between 2000 and 2010.1 Hypertension&#xD;
      treatment and control may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality by 20-40%.2&#xD;
      However, less than 10% of individuals with hypertension are under control in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality.1 The low&#xD;
      prevalence of controlled hypertension may be partly because the vast majority (85.5%) of&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals in low- and middle-income countries receive a monotherapy,3 although&#xD;
      two or more medications are often needed to achieve a target blood pressure.4 Fixed dose&#xD;
      combination (FDC) pills, combining 2 or more classes of antihypertensive medications have&#xD;
      considerable appeal because they may reduce blood pressure (BP) more effectively and&#xD;
      efficiently compared to monotherapy by blocking two pathways contributing to hypertension.5&#xD;
      Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that FDC pills decreased the risk of&#xD;
      non-compliance by 26% compared with free-drug component regimen, while keeping the same rate&#xD;
      of reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events.6,7 However, many effective FDC&#xD;
      antihypertensive medications include either or both thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic and a&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASI) and use of these medications alone, or in&#xD;
      combination, generally require laboratory tests to monitor serum potassium. The principal&#xD;
      metabolic concern is a risk of incident 'dyskalemia', the occurrence of either hypo- or&#xD;
      hyper-kalemia: diuretic-induced hypokalemia and RASI-induced hyperkalemia. Practice&#xD;
      guidelines commonly recommend laboratory testing prior to initiation of these drugs, alone or&#xD;
      as part of FDC, and periodic monitoring during medication treatment, but guidelines are&#xD;
      extremely inconsistent8,9 and are not routinely implemented.10,11 The requirement for&#xD;
      laboratory testing is an impediment to implementing FDC in low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will quantify the risk (i.e., prevalence and incidence) of dyskalemia&#xD;
      in the context of FDC medication as initial therapy. The study is designed to implement a&#xD;
      promising FDC antihypertensive medication of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB, telmisartan)&#xD;
      and calcium channel blocker (CCB, amlodipine) in Bangladesh clinics in collaboration among&#xD;
      the National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh, Resolve to Save Lives, and Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the prevalence of dyskalemia in hypertensive patients who are candidates for&#xD;
           pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Of those patients initiating antihypertensive medication, estimate the incidence of&#xD;
           dyskalemia at two months after initiating a FDC combining telmisartan 40 mg/amlodipine 5&#xD;
           mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be pre-post study design. This design is chosen because the incidence of&#xD;
      dyskalemia is reasonably considered attributable to the initiation of FDC medication, given&#xD;
      the short follow-up period (i.e., the only change is the initiation of FDC medication in the&#xD;
      exposure status, and it is unlikely that other significant changes in medical and health&#xD;
      conditions occur and subsequently impact the incidence of dyskalemia). Because each&#xD;
      individual can serve as both control and treatment (i.e., the prevalence of dyskalemia will&#xD;
      serve as the control), pre-post design will be efficient to address our research question&#xD;
      while reserving the scientific rigor, compared to randomized control trials, which would&#xD;
      require a much larger sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The study will enroll adults (aged ≥40 years for men and ≥50 years for women)&#xD;
      with hypertension in Bangladesh who are eligible for the initiation of antihypertensive&#xD;
      medication. The age criteria are chosen because middle-aged to older adults bear the major&#xD;
      burden of dyskalemia. Due to the concern of teratogenicity of angiotensin receptor blocker,&#xD;
      we will not include women aged &lt;50 years in the study. This cut-off was selected based on the&#xD;
      general consideration of reproductive age (e.g., 15-44 years in reports by the United States&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). We will not recruit individuals who are unable&#xD;
      to provide informed consent (e.g., children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants without prevalent hyperkalemia will receive the FDC telmisartan 40 mg/amlodipine&#xD;
      5 mg combination pill (1 pill a day). The cost for FDC per tablet is 12 to 15 cents, but&#xD;
      study participants will receive the study medication free of charge for three months. A&#xD;
      combination of telmisartan and amlodipine was selected according to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicine.17 Of note, two-drug FDC pills of ARB and&#xD;
      CCB for hypertension were recently added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicine to&#xD;
      improve global availability and affordability, following an application from the Resolve To&#xD;
      Save Lives.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four study visits for the study: screening visit, eligibility visit, FDC&#xD;
      initiation visit, and follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence and retention strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General strategy: The study is designed to promote high adherence and retention, e.g. few&#xD;
      visits, low data collection burden, and brief study duration. During implementation, we will&#xD;
      actively promote adherence at the in-person visits and telephone calls. The first call will&#xD;
      happen approximately 1 week after the FDC initiation visit. We will check in on participants&#xD;
      to see if they have any issues or concerns after taking the medication. The second call will&#xD;
      happen just before follow-up visit. The main purpose of this second call is to encourage&#xD;
      participants to return to clinic for follow-up visit. In addition to active phone-calls to&#xD;
      participants, we will set up a hotline so that participants can contact the clinic when they&#xD;
      have questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal risks of the study are symptoms and adverse effects related to the FDC,&#xD;
      primarily hypotension. When adverse events are suspected (e.g., dizziness), participants will&#xD;
      be advised to call us on the hotline. Depending on the nature of the symptom, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to visit the clinic. Study physicians will evaluate the participant and may&#xD;
      adjust the medication if needed (e.g., switch to amlodipine monotherapy or stop medication).&#xD;
      In such scenarios, lab tests will be conducted at the timing of medication&#xD;
      adjustment/discontinuation and we will include these participants in the primary analysis&#xD;
      (regardless of the duration of follow-up). Serious adverse events, defined by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration,19 will be collected, and reported to the data safety and&#xD;
      monitoring board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks and strategies to mitigate the risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate minimal psychological or physical risks to participants. The major anticipated&#xD;
      risks and strategies to mitigate the risks are Loss of confidentiality, Blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement, Blood draw, Blood pressure medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to detect a dyskalemia incidence of 2.5% or higher, the study will need to enroll&#xD;
      1,290 participants who are free of dyskalemia at screening and who complete a follow-up&#xD;
      visit, assuming a type I error probability of 0.05 (two-sided) and 80% power.). For this&#xD;
      calculation, the threshold of 2.5% corresponds to the 'tolerable limit', which is the level&#xD;
      that would be deemed unacceptable based on available literature and assessment of the study's&#xD;
      clinician investigators10,11 We estimate that if the observed incidence of dyskalemia is&#xD;
      1.5%, then the actual incidence will not exceed 2.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed jointly between Bangladesh and Hopkins team. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be presented as mean (SD) for continuous variables and numbers (percentage)&#xD;
      for categorical variables. We will use histograms to describe the distribution of potassium&#xD;
      levels prior to and after the initiation of FDC medication. The prevalence and incidence of&#xD;
      dyskalemia, and other binary outcomes of interest will be estimated using Poisson regression&#xD;
      models&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry process At screening sites, paper-based questionnaire forms will be filled by&#xD;
      participants. Then, project staff (interviewers) will enter the data into REDCap. At clinics,&#xD;
      clinic nurse will conduct an interview and record the response on a mobile computer device&#xD;
      into REDCap. All data will be saved in the server of NHFB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Research Officer of the study clinic will be the designated person for data&#xD;
      management. Study personnel and the principal investigators will be responsible for&#xD;
      monitoring and evaluating the completeness of data. Suspected missing data and discrepancies&#xD;
      will be reported to the study site, and necessary corrections will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Heart Foundation Hospital &amp; Research Institute, Screening room, Hypertension Clinic,&#xD;
      Pathological Laboratory with all apparatus and chemical reagents required for blood and urine&#xD;
      test. Additional Facilities Required: No additional facilities required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilization of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide valuable information related to the need, if any, for laboratory&#xD;
      testing prior to and during treatment of patients with hypertension who are candidates for&#xD;
      medication treatment. Findings from this study could change the approach to managing&#xD;
      hypertension, and ultimately lead to improved hypertension control which subsequently reduces&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular disease in this population. In addition, results deriving from&#xD;
      this project will also be shared in several ways. We will publish our results in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals. In addition, findings including preliminary data will be presented at&#xD;
      national conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical implications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as part of usual care for hypertension, and participants will&#xD;
      benefit from treating hypertension through the use of FDC medication. Additionally, our&#xD;
      findings, the incidence of dyskalemia after initiating FDC medication, could ultimately&#xD;
      contribute to the significant public health benefits. Specifically, if the prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence of dyskalemia is low, as anticipated, our results will provide evidence that&#xD;
      routine laboratory testing might not be necessary. Given that our study poses minimal risk&#xD;
      and inconvenience to participants, we anticipate the potential risks are outweighed by the&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
