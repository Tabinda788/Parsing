  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an important method for the treatment of&#xD;
      hematological diseases and cyclophosphamide is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for&#xD;
      transplant pretreatment. The incidence of severe cardiovascular events after high-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide exposure ranges from 7% to 28% with mortality from 11% to 43%. Thus, an&#xD;
      non-invasive, sensitive and reliable method in detecting cardiac function is significant to&#xD;
      balance the cardiac risk and the potential cancer treatment benefits. In previous studies, we&#xD;
      demonstrated that strain values analyzed by speckle tracking echocardiography decreased&#xD;
      significantly after high-dose cyclophosphamide exposure, even though left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction remained stable and within normal range. We follow up the hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell transplantation patients with cyclophosphamide: to analyze the cut-off values of the&#xD;
      parameters of speckle tracking multilayer analysis in predicting early cardiotoxicity induced&#xD;
      by cyclophosphamide; to detect the cut-off values of the plasma miRNAs levels in predicting&#xD;
      early cardiotoxicity induced by anthracycline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to find out non-invasive, reliable and sensitive&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameters and plasma biomarkers for early detection and prediction&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide -induced cardiac toxicity and to be helpful to target patients at high risk&#xD;
      of cardiotoxicity, who could benefit from closer monitoring or earlier initiation of&#xD;
      cardioprotective therapy.&#xD;

      After obtaining the informed consent of the research subjects, collect the following data of&#xD;
      the research subjects: demographic information, clinical symptoms, family history and&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis. Patients were tested for troponin, atrial natriuretic peptide, concurrent&#xD;
      conventional electrocardiogram, conventional echocardiogram, speckle tracking&#xD;
      echocardiography at spots 1 day before cyclophosphamide treatment, 2 days after&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide infusion, and 10 days after cyclophosphamide infusion.&#xD;
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulated whole blood were saved and extract the blood&#xD;
      cells from the sample bank and freeze them for RNA sequencing. The two-dimensional cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound image acquisition complies with the guidelines of the American Echocardiography&#xD;
      Association, and the two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography acquisition is 4&#xD;
      cardiac cycles. If a cardiotoxic event occurs during this period, an electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      conventional echocardiogram, and speckle tracking echocardiography should be performed within&#xD;
      24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyze the correlation between miRNA and clinical events of cardiotoxicity, and evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive threshold of cardiotoxicity in children with high-dose cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      chemotherapy.Evaluate the weight of miRNA in predicting cardiac damage, combined with serum&#xD;
      biomarkers, construct a model for Predicting the risk of myocardial damage based on speckle&#xD;
      tracking echocardiography parameters, serum biomarkers, and miRNA expression.&#xD;
