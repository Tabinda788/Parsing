    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of auricular point acupressure in improving&#xD;
      fatigue,sleep quality,physical activity and quality of life in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer under chemotherapy in taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The fatigue in auricular point acupressure group is significant improving than&#xD;
           usual-care group at 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The sleep quality in auricular point acupressure group is significant improving than&#xD;
           usual-care group at 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The physical activity in auricular point acupressure group is significant improving than&#xD;
           usual-care group at 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The quality of life in auricular point acupressure group is significant improving than&#xD;
           usual-care group at 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th week.&#xD;

    <description>This scale was evaluated by self-assessment of various clinical problems for a week.The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists three subscales with 30 questions.The EORTC QLQ-C30 included three subscales: functioning scales (15questions), symptom scales (13 questions), and global health status (2questions). The reliability and validity of Cronbach'α was 0.52-0.89. About the functional scale and the global health status, the higher the total score, the better the quality of life; the lower the score in the symptom scale, the better the quality of life.</description>
