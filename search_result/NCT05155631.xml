  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most well researched and most effective treatment&#xD;
      for IBS targeting the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis, and preliminary data show that this&#xD;
      therapeutic effect is associated with a reduction of brainstem connectivity with other brain&#xD;
      networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased prevalence of IBS in women, the higher rate of comorbid non-GI pain conditions,&#xD;
      as well as the higher prevalence in female IBS of increased sensitivity to a variety of&#xD;
      internal and external stimuli (multisensory sensitivity) suggest the presence of important&#xD;
      sex differences in some of these BGM mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research performed by UCLA SCOR during previous funding has established an increased&#xD;
      responsiveness of the CRF-Locus Coeruleus (LCC) system in female IBS subjects, suggesting&#xD;
      that this central noradrenergic brainstem system plays an important role in IBS&#xD;
      pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study team's earlier research has begun to identify clinical, functional and&#xD;
      structural brain mechanisms that may underlie these sex effects. Based on the preliminary&#xD;
      data, the overall goal of this project is to use CBT as a probe to study the relationship&#xD;
      between specific disease-related alterations of the brain, the gut microbiome, and&#xD;
      symptomatic outcome, and identify the role of sex differences in these relationships.&#xD;
      Investigators will study male and female IBS patients before and after CBT using the advanced&#xD;
      neuroimaging and microbiome technologies of the overall SCOR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 150 adult IBS participants will be completed in years 1-4 of the proposed studies.&#xD;
      These will be 50 males, 50 premenopausal females in the treatment arm (Cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy: CBT) and 50 in 'usual care' arm, all bowel habit subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening V1: All subjects will have a pre-screening using a study specific IRB approved&#xD;
      prescreening tool (15-20 minutes). lf eligible and interested, the study team will send the&#xD;
      ICF via email to the subject and then study team will review the ICF with the subject to&#xD;
      determine understanding of study participation and risks/benefits. Subjects will sign and&#xD;
      return to the coordinator by electronic/scan/fax methods. The study team will then send&#xD;
      participants a short link of preliminary questionnaires via survey Monkey to further&#xD;
      determine eligibility for participation and assist the clinician in obtaining accurate&#xD;
      medical history as well as assess any risk factors of participation. When determined to be&#xD;
      eligible, the study team will set up a video/zoom /phone meeting to complete the initial&#xD;
      screening visit/medical and psychological history taking. This will take about 1.5 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come to the OCNSR center to complete the study screening, including a physical&#xD;
      exam by the RN and RN/NP or MD. Upon arrival, they will date and sign the informed consent&#xD;
      and have time to ask any questions. The physical exam will include vital signs, height,&#xD;
      weight, and a ROS (review of systems). There will be a single blood sample taken of about 2&#xD;
      teaspoons to determine menstrual cycle (females) and if needed, there may be additional blood&#xD;
      (about 1 tablespoon) for IBS-diarrhea or mixed predominance to rule out any other&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disease similar to IBS symptoms. Subjects will be given sample collection&#xD;
      items to take home for stool and diet diary collection. The stool sample will be collected&#xD;
      when they return for the scheduled MRI within 1-3 weeks of screening. They will be given two&#xD;
      unique de-identified online Survey Monkey links to complete before the MRI visit. One link is&#xD;
      a Diet History Questionnaires (VioScreen) and the other is a group of questionnaires asking&#xD;
      about symptoms (IBS), mood and general health and wellbeing. This visit will take about 1.5-2&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI V2: Brain and Brainstem Data Acquisition: All participants will undergo a 70 minute&#xD;
      structural, resting state, DTI and brain stem MRI scanning session. All subjects will be&#xD;
      imaged on a Siemens 3 Tesla Prisma scanner housed at the UCLA Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping&#xD;
      Center (ALBMC). Subjects will complete several state anxiety and symptom-measuring&#xD;
      questionnaires upon arrival . Females will need to do daily urine test at home to identify&#xD;
      their menstrual phase. When arriving to MRI they will give a urine sample for pregnancy&#xD;
      testing and will be excluded if pregnant. A single blood sample will be collected via&#xD;
      venipuncture for hormones, cell methylation and pro inflammatory cytokines (15-20 ccs).&#xD;
      Subjects will return with their diet diary, stool and saliva (female) sample collections and&#xD;
      have all samples reviewed by study coordinator, for viability and collection accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning will follow parameters of the HBC (Human Brain Connectome) project with anterior and&#xD;
      posterior views for each scan. They will have the structural MP Rage (gray matter imaging)&#xD;
      scan (time ~14.5 minutes) and subjects can watch a movie of their choice during this scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this is 2 RSN (resting state) functional scan (total time ~12 minutes).&#xD;
      Instructions verbatim are given to subject during the RSN to rest, relax and focus on the&#xD;
      crosshair displayed on mirrored screen reflected on the head coil without going to sleep.&#xD;
      Following the resting state scan the subject will be asked if they had any pain or discomfort&#xD;
      anywhere that may have distracted the subject during the functional resting state and this&#xD;
      will be documented on a subject chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next scan is the DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) lasting approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Subjects can watch a movie of their choice during this scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will take no more than 1.5-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomized to CBT (66.5 % chance) or usual care (33.5 % chance). The&#xD;
      CBT is described below. If usual care, the subject will not have any restrictions on subjects&#xD;
      except that the study team will ask subjects not to start new therapies for IBS or new&#xD;
      medicines unless it is deemed necessary by their PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT: This structured educational and skills based intervention is carried out via internet&#xD;
      instruction and individual practice. Subjects will be asked to log into the CBT site once per&#xD;
      week for 8-10 weeks with each session lasting between 20 and 40 minutes. The content has been&#xD;
      validated in a randomized internet-based CBT trial for IBS. The intervention does not entail&#xD;
      any direct therapist contact or interaction with other patients or study participants. The&#xD;
      intervention is hosted by Mahana Therapeutics Inc. (named Parallel TM) who is contracted by&#xD;
      UCLA to provide the intervention. Following enrollment, each subject will receive a secure&#xD;
      login for accessing the CBT site and no personally identifying information will be asked for&#xD;
      or passed along to the site or Mahana Therapeutics. During the 8 week intervention period&#xD;
      subjects will be contacted by a study coordinator for follow-up should they stop logging in&#xD;
      to the web site and they will be able to contact a study coordinator with questions regarding&#xD;
      the intervention, website access, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A responder will be defined as a subject with IBS-SSS score change of ≥50 from baseline to&#xD;
      end of treatment and corresponds to a clinically meaningful change in symptoms. Participants&#xD;
      assigned to the Usual Care condition will have the same questionnaire, neuroimaging,&#xD;
      biological and symptom assessments as those in CBT but will not have any specific&#xD;
      intervention from the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a short mid study SM questionnaire link to complete related to symptoms. After&#xD;
      8-10 weeks of CBT (within 2-3 weeks of completion) they will return for a post-CBT MRI visit&#xD;
      identical to description above.&#xD;

             conditions include but are not limited to gastrointestinal surgery (exceptions:&#xD;
             appendectomy, benign polypectomy, cholecystectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of a significant and ongoing medical problem that would interfere with&#xD;
             participation in the study or testing the study hypotheses (e.g., major heart disease,&#xD;
             neurological disorders, inflammatory diseases such as IBD; esophagitis, celiac&#xD;
             disease, gastrointestinal malignancy or obstruction, peptic, duodenal or gastric ulcer&#xD;

             need to be stopped at least 72 hours prior to any physiologic test visit and during&#xD;
             the baseline and treatment intervention. For this we will ask the subject to get&#xD;
             approval from their own PCP to stop prior to any intervention. However, rescue&#xD;
             medication of bisacodyl and loperamide will be allowed for prolonged constipation and&#xD;
