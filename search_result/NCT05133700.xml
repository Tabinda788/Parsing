  <brief_summary>

      To describe the barriers and facilitators experienced by residents, health and social care&#xD;
      staff, commissioners and regulators when managing medicines within care homes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prescribing of medicines is the most frequent health intervention in England. The&#xD;
      administration or omission of medicines is not without risk and incidents involving medicines&#xD;
      occur. The frequency of prescribing medicines increases with age and frailty. People living&#xD;
      in care homes (with and without nursing) are generally older and more frail than similar&#xD;
      groups in the community. Therefore, care homes and their staff need to be proficient and safe&#xD;
      when administering medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, an under investigated area of prescribed medicines is the views of people living in&#xD;
      care homes, health and social care staff, commissioners and regulator about managing&#xD;
      medicines in care homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study a series of semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be undertaken.&#xD;
      These focus groups will be held with people living in care homes (with and without nursing).&#xD;
      Further interviews and focus groups will be held with health and social care staff,&#xD;
      commissioners and regulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care homes will be invited to provide copies of their current medicines monitoring tool. In&#xD;
      addition, services supporting care homes including community pharmacies will also be invited&#xD;
      to provide copies of their current medicines monitoring tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of conversations and monitoring tools made available to the study team will be&#xD;
      undertaken and compared to published literature including grey literature.&#xD;
