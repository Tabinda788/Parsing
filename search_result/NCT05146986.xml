  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational, cohort study involving skilled&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgeons who are experienced in implanting the treatment of non-flail chest&#xD;
      rib fractures and the use of RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefits of surgical stabilization of rib&#xD;
      fractures (SSRF) in patients with non-flail chest rib fractures using RibFix Blu Thoracic&#xD;
      Fixation System when compared to non-surgical (analgesia and symptomatic management)&#xD;
      treatment. The study will include up to 167 cases of non-flail chest rib fractures with 95&#xD;
      cases in non-surgical treatment group and 72 cases in the surgical group. Each center may&#xD;
      enroll up to maximum 30 cases to permit the assessment of outcome across a variety&#xD;
      investigators and clinical settings. Enrolment will be competitive among sites and closed as&#xD;
      soon as a total of 167 cases are recruited.&#xD;

    <description>Health related qualify of life using EuroQoL-5L(EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires from the different groups.&#xD;
A standardized measure of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions, namely mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D-5L version was used in the study. Each dimension has 5 responses recording 5 levels of severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems or extreme problems). The responses to the EQ-5D dimensions are used to obtain a single EQ-5D index value where 1 represents full health and 0 represents death. The questionnaire also includes a vertical, visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) for the respondents to record their self-rated health where the 2 extreme ends of the scale are labelled as 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state' respectively</description>
