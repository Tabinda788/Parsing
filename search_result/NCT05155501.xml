  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare cancer control and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life following pelvic fascia-sparing radical prostatectomy versus&#xD;
      standard radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that pelvic fascia-sparing radical prostatectomy will have&#xD;
      similar cancer control (primary outcome) and sexual function outcomes; and significantly&#xD;
      better urinary function, penile shortening/deformity and inguinal hernia risks as compared to&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional radical prostatectomy is the most popular treatment for clinically significant&#xD;
      prostate cancer, however significant risks including urinary incontinence, erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction, penile shortening, penile curvature/ deformation (Peyronie's disease), and&#xD;
      inguinal hernia, are common. Pelvic fascia-sparing radical prostatectomy is a new surgical&#xD;
      technique that may preserve fascial support structures, arterial supply to the penis, and&#xD;
      nerves that are severed and resected during conventional radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll adult men undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Subjects will be randomized to receive either radical prostatectomy or&#xD;
      pelvic fascia-sparing radical prostatectomy. Investigators will compare cancer control and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life outcomes through patient questionnaires and medical record&#xD;
      review.&#xD;

    <measure>Biochemical Recurrence as assessed by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels are obtained from standard of care blood tests, and PSA values are measured in ng/mL.&#xD;
In accordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, investigators will capture PSA persistence as failure of PSA to fall to undetectable levels, and PSA recurrence as an undetectable PSA after surgery with a subsequent detectable PSA that increases on 2 or more determinations.</description>

    <measure>Surgery-Related Adverse Events as assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire will include 20 items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), survey items pertinent to short-stay cancer surgery.&#xD;
The questionnaire will assess patient-reported complications and adverse events, such as constipation, nausea and vomiting, fever, chills, fatigue, pain, shortness of breath, swelling and bruising, redness and discharge at the surgical incision site, anxiety, and flatulence (ileus). It will also assess patient contacts with physicians and admittance to urgent care or the emergency room.</description>

    <measure>Change in Urinary and Sexual Function, as measured by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) is a 7-item questionnaire assessing two health-related quality of life domains: urinary and sexual function. All questions refer to patients' health and symptoms in the last four weeks.&#xD;
Each domain is scored out of 12 points, with higher scores indicating more complications.&#xD;
In total, the EPIC-CP score is the final sum of the two domains, with higher scores indicating more issues related to overall prostate cancer quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Penile Shortening and Sexual Function, as measured by a 5-item questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 5-item questionnaire, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), that has face validity for assessing penile shortening, self-esteem, and erectile function after radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
Question 1 assesses patients' perceived penile length post-surgery, compared to penile length at 30 years of age. It consists of two possible responses: Yes or No.&#xD;
Questions 2 and 3 assesses patients' ability to obtain and quality of spontaneous morning erections and sexual activity-related erections. It consists of five possible responses: ranging from &quot;No erections&quot; to &quot;Erections always sufficient&quot;.&#xD;
Question 4 is a visual digital scale assessing patients' present quality of life. It is scored on a scale of 1-7, with higher scores indicating high quality of life.&#xD;
Question 5 is a visual digital scale assessing patients' present self-esteem. It is scored on a scale of 1-7, with higher scores indicating high self-esteem.</description>

    <measure>Change in patient-Reported Penile Curvature/Deformity (Peyronie's Disease), as measured by a 3-item questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This is a validated, 3-item questionnaire assessing presence of Peyronie's disease. The penile deformity items were validated by blinded clinical examination with 100% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity.&#xD;
Question 1 assesses penile hardening/plaques in the flaccid state. Question 2 assesses penile curvature in the erect state. Question 3 assesses pain associated with erection. Each question consists of two possible responses: Yes or No.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported Decision Regret, as measured by a 5-item questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 5-item questionnaire assessing treatment regret that was developed and validated in men with prostate cancer.&#xD;
Each item is scored on a 5 point scale ranging from &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot;. Responses are converted to a score ranging from 0-100, with higher scores indicating more regret.</description>
