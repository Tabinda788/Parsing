      The Shared Decision Making about Medication Use for People with Multiple Health Problems&#xD;
      study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a deprescribing educational&#xD;
      intervention in primary care for patients with dementia and multiple chronic conditions&#xD;
      (MCC), the patients' care partners, and clinicians.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People living with dementia are prescribed more medications and have more complex medication&#xD;
      regimens than people without dementia. These problems are exacerbated in people with dementia&#xD;
      and multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Having multiple diseases simultaneously (e.g.,&#xD;
      diabetes and hypertension, and dementia) leads to the use of multiple drugs (polypharmacy)&#xD;
      and potentially inappropriate medications, in which the risks of medications outweigh&#xD;
      benefits, or medications do not align with the patient's treatment goals. For individuals&#xD;
      with dementia and MCC, taking more medications is associated with a greater risk of adverse&#xD;
      drug events, drug interactions, and treatment burden. Medication regimen complexity is a&#xD;
      major source of burden for family caregivers of people living with dementia and has been&#xD;
      associated with numerous adverse outcomes. Studies suggest that as many as 56% of people with&#xD;
      dementia take at least one potentially inappropriate medication, including medications that&#xD;
      can negatively affect cognitive function. Optimizing medication use through deprescribing&#xD;
      (the process of reducing or stopping the use of potentially inappropriate medications or&#xD;
      medications unlikely to be beneficial) can improve outcomes for patients with dementia and&#xD;
      MCC. Therefore, the investigator proposes a patient-centered deprescribing educational&#xD;
      intervention for older adults with dementia and MCC, generalizable to a range of primary care&#xD;
      settings. This study builds on OPTIMIZE, the investigator team's primary care-based&#xD;
      deprescribing intervention for patients with mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and MCC&#xD;
      that is currently in the midst of a multisite randomized trial within Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Colorado. OPTIMIZE consists of a patient and family component focused on education and&#xD;
      activation about deprescribing and a clinician component to increase awareness about&#xD;
      processes and language for deprescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot study of medication optimization through increased&#xD;
      awareness of deprescribing for older adults with cognitive impairment and MCC. The&#xD;
      intervention will have two components: a patient/ care partner component focused on education&#xD;
      and activation about deprescribing, and a clinician component focused on increasing clinician&#xD;
      awareness about options and processes for deprescribing in the cognitive impairment-MCC&#xD;
      population. The proposed intervention has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among&#xD;
      patients, care partners, and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of the primary and secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of measuring the primary outcome, the chronic medication&#xD;
           count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the feasibility of measuring two secondary outcomes, the patient-level&#xD;
           Medication Regimen Complexity Index (pMRCI), and the Family Caregiver Medication&#xD;
           Administration Hassles Scale (FCMAHS), a caregiver-reported outcome measure.&#xD;
