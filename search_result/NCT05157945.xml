    <measure>To understand the relationship between baseline biology and change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) with ALTO-300</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 6 times over 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) measures the severity of depression where smaller scores indicate less depression and higher scores suggest more severe depression. Possible scores for this 10 item version range from 0 to 60. The change from baseline to the end of the study is the primary outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To understand the relationship between baseline biology and change in the Clinical Global Impression scale - Severity (CGI-S) with ALTO-300</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 6 times over 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression scale - Severity (CGI-S) measures the severity of psychopathology in general where smaller scores indicate less illness and higher scores suggest more severe illness. Possible scores for this scale range from 1 to 7. The change from baseline to the end of the study is the primary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of ALTO-300</measure>
    <time_frame>From the signing of the ICF until the follow-up visit (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Vital Signs Abnormalities as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of ALTO-300</measure>
    <time_frame>From the signing of the ICF until the end-of-treatment visit (up to 11 weeks)]</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs measured include blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and weight.</description>
