  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been rising rapidly with an increased burden to&#xD;
      the healthcare system. As such T2D prevention is highly recommendable, and, theoretically, it&#xD;
      can definitely be successful. However, though feasible T2D prevention is difficult to&#xD;
      implement due to the heterogeneity of the disease that make response to population&#xD;
      intervention (and treatment) only partially successful. Precision medicine aims to prevent&#xD;
      chronic diseases by tailoring interventions or recommendations to a combination of a genetic&#xD;
      background, metabolic profile, and lifestyle. Classification of individuals at risk into&#xD;
      clusters that differ in their susceptibility to develop T2D may foster the identification of&#xD;
      preventive interventions. Recent advances in omics technologies have offered opportunities as&#xD;
      well as challenges in the use of precision medicine to prevent T2D. Moreover, new mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) technologies have enhanced how diabetes is managed. However, little is still&#xD;
      known about the effectiveness of mHealth technology as intervention tools for reducing&#xD;
      diabetes risk.&#xD;

      Multicenter, interventional study (mHealth automated behavioral intervention versus&#xD;
      traditional recommendations) designed: 1. toexplore the potential of more accurate subgroup&#xD;
      distinction in prediabetes that may help to deliver a more effective preventive strategy with&#xD;
      the final goal to enhance the possibility to prevent or delay the development of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes; 2. toexplore the use of mHealth to modify lifestyle in a subgroup of subjects known&#xD;
      for their elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes (i.e. obese and women with previous&#xD;
      gestational diabetes) and to determine the impact of such strategies on the basis of&#xD;
      individual characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: 1200 subjects at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes will be enrolled based on&#xD;
      an opportunistic approach (FINDRISK questionnaire).The questionnaire will be made available&#xD;
      at GP's offices, Pharmacies as well as through media.Moreover, the infrastructure for data&#xD;
      collection and patient interventions will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: all individuals will be characterized on the basis of diet habits (EPIC&#xD;
      questionnaire; Binge Eating Scale) and physical activity (by a wrist-worn wearable device) as&#xD;
      well metabolic profile (complete blood count, creatinine, plasma glucose and insulin, HbA1c,&#xD;
      liver function tests, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, urine test,&#xD;
      auto-antibody anti-GAD, and A/C ratio on urine spot sample; 75-g oral glucose tolerance test;&#xD;
      HOMA-B and HOMA-IR)for identification of special subgroups.Circulating RNA and miRNAwill be&#xD;
      extracted from lymphocytes and plasmafor identification ofbiomarkers for prediction of risk&#xD;
      of disease and new targets for preventive intervention. A biobank of serum, urine and stool&#xD;
      samples will be also collected genetic characterization and for omics profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3, all lab determination and cluster analysis will be performed. All data will be&#xD;
      integrated in the infrastructurefor the identification of new relevant factors and indicators&#xD;
      useful for better understanding health conditions and outcomesand for the analysis of&#xD;
      discrete risk subtypes (cluster).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: the validity of themHealth approach on the metabolic and lifestyle attitude as a&#xD;
      function of the individual characterization as obtained in Phase 3 will be tested in the&#xD;
      exploratory clinical trial.ThemHealth automated behavioral intervention via E-mail, web, and&#xD;
      mobile phone will be developed and tested in a trial in two high-risk populations of obese&#xD;
      non-diabetic subjects (n=150) and women with previous gestational diabetes (n=150). These&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either 9-month conventional recommendation for correct&#xD;
      lifestyle based on the procedures described in the Diabetes Prevention Programme or mHealth&#xD;
      automated behavioral intervention via E-mail, web, and mobile phone. Subjects will be seen at&#xD;
      3-month interval for recording of anthropometric measurements and determination of fasting&#xD;
      plasma insulin and glucose as well as lipid profile. During the last two weeks of the&#xD;
      intervention trial all subjects will be provided with the same wearable device used for&#xD;
      initial characterization for recording of the same initial parameters. At completion of the&#xD;
      follow-up all initial measurements will be repeated.Data will then be analyzed as changes vs.&#xD;
      baselines between the two groups as well as according to any sub-group.&#xD;
