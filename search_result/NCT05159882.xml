    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of THR-1442 compared to Dapagliflozin&#xD;
      as an add-on therapy to metformin in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in subjects with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 390 subjects with inadequately controlled T2DM on metformin were to be&#xD;
      recruited from China. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive THR-1442 tablet, 20 mg, or&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin tavlet,10 mg, in a ratio of 1:1 once daily for 24 weeks. Subjects were to&#xD;
      continue taking metformin for the duration of the study.&#xD;
