    <textblock>
      Aim of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy plus durvalumab followed by reduced-dose hypo-fractionated thoracic RT&#xD;
      (concurrent with durvalumab) and durvalumab maintenance for stage 3 unresectable NSCLC&#xD;
      patients candidate to sequential chemo-RT.&#xD;

      The study hypothesis is that the new regimen tested in this study will be safe and effective&#xD;
      by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. anticipating the use of durvalumab, together with chemotherapy (higher efficacy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. harnessing response to induction chemo-durvalumab (which is expected to be significant)&#xD;
           to be able to reduce radiotherapy dose without reducing tumor control probability&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. reducing radiation-induced immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. reducing radiation-induced late morbidity, this aspect is important when considering&#xD;
           that this regimen is expected to be able to cure a proportion of patients (long-term&#xD;
           survivors)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase II study, the investigators will evaluate the combination of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy plus durvalumab followed by reduced-dose hypo-fractionated thoracic RT&#xD;
      (concurrent with durvalumab) and durvalumab maintenance for stage 3 unresectable NSCLC&#xD;
      patients candidate to sequential chemo-RT.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine while receiving IP and up&#xD;
             to 30 days after the last dose of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
