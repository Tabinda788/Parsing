  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In thoracic surgery, one-lung ventilation using a double-lumen tube (DLT) is often performed&#xD;
      to protect dependent lung and provide comfortable surgical conditions. However, serious&#xD;
      complications and adverse events can be encountered during DLT placement. One of the most&#xD;
      important steps to avoid these drawbacks is to choose the appropriate size of DLT. The width&#xD;
      of the trachea can be measured by using different imaging methods such as computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) and ultrasonography (US) to predict the appropriate DLT size. CT can also contribute to&#xD;
      the proper placement of DLT by giving us the length of the trachea and main bronchi. In this&#xD;
      study, we hypothesized that the size of the DLT can be determined more accurately by&#xD;
      measuring the trachea diameter by using US and CT before DLT intubation. At the same time, we&#xD;
      aimed to determine whether the evaluation of tracheobronchial anatomy with CT would&#xD;
      contribute to the placement of DLT at a more appropriate level.&#xD;

    <description>Ultrasound measurements will be made with a 5-10 MegaHertz linear probe positioned in the horizontal plane at the midline of the anterior neck. After identifying the vocal cords as paired hyperechoic linear structures, the probe was moved caudally to visualize the cricoid arch. The transverse air column diameter was measured at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage.</description>
