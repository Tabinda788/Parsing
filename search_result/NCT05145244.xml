      The primary objectives of this prospective non-interventional study (NIS) are to assess and&#xD;
      describe outcomes in relation to biomarkers, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in&#xD;
      patients with non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer receiving treatment&#xD;
      offered in the clinic (standard of care or included in clinical trials).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, there have been few studies evaluating the day- to-day effects of non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC), and advanced (ABC) or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and its treatment&#xD;
      on patients in a real-world setting. There is a gap between the data from the narrowly&#xD;
      focused low-quantity, high-quality interventional studies and less granular data collection,&#xD;
      high-quantity real world data (RWD). Therefore, prospective, observational trials including&#xD;
      all patients independent of biomarkers and collecting comprehensive data on each are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe treatment outcomes based on RWD by a complete set of clinical,&#xD;
           socio-psychological, medico-economics data and biospecimens, including whole genome&#xD;
           sequencing (WGS) of all patients with breast cancer and NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To record the treatment-related adverse events and late effects experienced by patients&#xD;
           based on PRO tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform refined biomarker analyses, including (but not limited to) whole genome&#xD;
           sequencing, on tumor biopsies at baseline and at progression, in order to identify&#xD;
           potential treatment targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, non-interventional, multicenter study of patients initiating&#xD;
      treatment for NSCLC or breast cancer in Copenhagen (Denmark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Eligible patients will have breast cancer or NSCLC and acceptable performance&#xD;
      status and organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: Study data will be collected via a baseline site questionnaire; Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes (PRO) questions via mobile application at cycle-based intervals; and&#xD;
      patient medical information from medical records into an eCRF at baseline and at every visit&#xD;
      until the end of the follow-up period. Baseline WGS will be performed on diagnostic/surgical&#xD;
      specimens after informed consent according to the Danish law of the National Genome Center.&#xD;
      There are no specific protocol-mandated tests, procedures, or clinic visits for this study,&#xD;
      but repeat sequential biopsies for WGS are optional at progression. All data collection for&#xD;
      this study will occur over a 30-months period (including all treatment lines for new patients&#xD;
      included in the period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size: Up to 2400 patients diagnosed with NSCLC or breast cancer will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Breast cancer patients will be enrolled at Rigshospitalet, and NSCLC at Rigshospitalet and&#xD;
      Herlev Hospital. Any patient who meets the eligibility criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Eligibility will be assessed prior to enrollment during a scheduled&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Analyses will generally be descriptive and explorative in nature and will be&#xD;
      conducted using SPSS statistical software, and no sample size calculations can be performed.&#xD;
      All variables will be summarized descriptively through tabular displays of mean, median,&#xD;
      ranges, and standard deviations of continuous variables and frequency distributions of&#xD;
      categorical variables. Exploratory analyses may be conducted to examine correlations and/or&#xD;
      other research questions (e.g., time-to-first-neutropenia using Kaplan- Meier methods or&#xD;
      mutational status and response). No formal hypothesis testing or comparisons between&#xD;
      treatment groups are performed.&#xD;

      Diagnostic specimens will be used as baseline, and new biopsies will be performed at&#xD;
      progression if feasible. A fresh tumor sample from metastatic sites will be obtained under&#xD;
      local anaesthesia. If adequate tissue is available, samples are stored in RNAlater (Life&#xD;
      Technologies) for RNA expression analyses and DNA gene mutation analyses and one sample is&#xD;
      being formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for histopathologic analyses. Otherwise,&#xD;
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) will be used for WGS. A blood sample (7 mL EDTA) is&#xD;
      collected for germline mutation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid biopsies will be performed at baseline and at every treatment cycle. Peripheral blood&#xD;
      is collected in BCT tubes (Streck Laboratories, Omaha, NE, USA). Circulating DNA (cfDNA) will&#xD;
      be extracted from 2-4 ml plasma using the QIAsymphony Circulating DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,&#xD;
      Germany).&#xD;
