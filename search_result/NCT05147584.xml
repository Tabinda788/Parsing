    <textblock>
      The Raydiant Oximetry Sensing System (Lumerah) is a non-invasive fetal pulse oximeter that&#xD;
      measures fetal arterial oxygen saturation using safe, non-invasive, transabdominal&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy. Lumerah is intended as an adjunct to cardiotocography by&#xD;
      detecting decreases in fetal oxygenation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Raydiant Oximetry, Inc. is developing a novel and non-invasive fetal pulse oximetry device to&#xD;
      fundamentally improve how fetuses are monitored during labor. The Raydiant Oximetry Sensing&#xD;
      System (Lumerah) is a fetal pulse oximeter that measures fetal arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
      using safe, non-invasive, transabdominal near-infrared spectroscopy. Lumerah performs its&#xD;
      measurements without the requirement for transvaginal placement and its associated risks.&#xD;
      Lumerah is intended as an adjunct to cardiotocography by detecting fetal oxygen deprivation&#xD;
      which is both life-threatening to the fetus and can lead to the irreversibly debilitating&#xD;
      consequences of newborn metabolic acidosis. The severe consequences associated with newborn&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis and the lack of availability of an effective tool to support its early&#xD;
      diagnosis led to the development of Lumerah.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, women in labor will be simultaneously monitored with proven (previously&#xD;
      FDA-approved) technology as a &quot;ground truth&quot;. These women will be simultaneously monitored&#xD;
      with both an external and internal oxygen sensor. Obstetric health-care providers are blinded&#xD;
      to oximetry data presented by both devices; therefore, clinical decisions regarding&#xD;
      interventions are made based on the standard factors, including cardiotocography. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy analysis will be performed retrospectively by comparing data of fetal oxygenation&#xD;
      displayed and recorded by both devices. Results of either the Lumerah external sensor or the&#xD;
      internal sensor will not be used to guide or alter patient management.&#xD;
