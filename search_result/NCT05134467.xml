      This is a prospective, single-center, observational study to describe characteristics of&#xD;
      weaning process and factors associated with duration of weaning and its outcomes in all&#xD;
      consecutive adult (aged 19 years and older) patients receiving mechanical ventilation for at&#xD;
      least two calendar days in medical intensive care units since November 2017. Details of the&#xD;
      patients' weaning process and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in addition to clinical,&#xD;
      laboratory, and outcome data will be collected in a specified format on the day of the&#xD;
      assessment by respiratory care practitioners.&#xD;

      Study design and objectives: This is a prospective, single-center, observational study to&#xD;
      address key issues relating to weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) in medical intensive&#xD;
      care units. This study aims to describe characteristics of weaning process and factors&#xD;
      associated with duration of weaning and its outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All consecutive adult (aged 19 years and older) patients receiving MV for&#xD;
      at least two calendar days in medical intensive care units since November 2017 will be&#xD;
      screened daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol based weaning process: Every morning, respiratory care practitioners assess a&#xD;
      patient's readiness to be weaned from MV in all patients who received MV for more than 24 h.&#xD;
      First, the patient's condition, including improvement of the underlying cause of respiratory&#xD;
      failure, clinical stability, and adequacy of pulmonary function and oxygenation are&#xD;
      comprehensively evaluated. If the patient fulfill all of the criteria of readiness for&#xD;
      weaning trials, SBT is conducted according to the protocol to assess the ability of the&#xD;
      patient for spontaneous breathing; if the patient does not fulfill the criteria, no further&#xD;
      weaning process is performed on that day. Our hospital performed the T-piece trial, in which&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen was provided through a T-piece connected to an endotracheal tube or&#xD;
      tracheostomy tube, on all patients until July 2019. From July 2019, SBT has been performed&#xD;
      with inspiratory pressure augmentation (the ventilator is set with a pressure support of 8&#xD;
      cmH2O and zero-positive end-expiratory pressure) for patients who received MV through an&#xD;
      endotracheal tube according to the revised weaning protocol. Tolerance for SBT is evaluated&#xD;
      for 30 min on the first attempt and for 2 h after the second attempt, regardless of the&#xD;
      method used. However, if a sign of SBT failure is identified even before the target duration,&#xD;
      the trial is immediately stopped. When the patient satisfies all the criteria for successful&#xD;
      SBT, extubation is performed immediately, and supplemental oxygen is provided by a high-flow&#xD;
      nasal cannula for at least 24 h in patients with an endotracheal tube; administration of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen is continued through a T-piece system in patients with tracheostomy.&#xD;
      Decisions about when and how to perform a tracheostomy are left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      clinicians and are not guided by a prescribed algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and clinical outcomes: Clinical, laboratory, and outcome data will be&#xD;
      prospectively collected by a trained study coordinator. The demographics of the patients and&#xD;
      major cause of intubation will be evaluated and recorded by the physicians on the day of MV&#xD;
      support initiation. Details of the patients' weaning readiness and SBT will be recorded in a&#xD;
      specified format on the day of the assessment by respiratory care practitioners. The values&#xD;
      of the MV setting and respiratory parameters are synchronized to the hospital electronic&#xD;
      medical chart and recorded every hour, and we will collect the values at 8 am on the day of&#xD;
      the first SBT. Clinical outcomes will be assessed by the successful weaning defined according&#xD;
      to Weaning Outcome according to a New Definition (WIND) study and WIND classification of&#xD;
      weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval and Patient Consent: The Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical&#xD;
      Center approved this study and waived the requirement for informed consent, because this&#xD;
      study is pure observation and data collection program that involves no more than minimal&#xD;
      risk, the data collected are part of routine clinical care that would not adversely affect&#xD;
      rights and welfare of subject, and the data will be anonymized.&#xD;
