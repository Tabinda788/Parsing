      A study of siremadlin in combination with venetoclax plus azacitidine in adult participants&#xD;
      with AML who are ineligible for chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether siremadlin in combination with&#xD;
      venetoclax plus azacitidine can enhance the clinical response in unfit AML patients without&#xD;
      unacceptable levels of treatment-emergent toxicities. The recommended dose of siremadlin in&#xD;
      combination with venetoclax plus azacitidine will be determined to be explored further in the&#xD;
      expansion phase and the preliminary efficacy in achieving Complete Remission (CR) will be&#xD;
      evaluated in participants who responded sub-optimally to first-line venetoclax plus&#xD;
      azacitidine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts. The primary purpose of Part 1 (Safety Run-in) is to&#xD;
      rule out excessive toxicity of siremadlin when administered in combination with venetoclax&#xD;
      plus azacitidine while the primary purpose of Part 2 (Expansion) is to evaluate the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of siremadlin when combined with venetoclax plus azacitidine in the&#xD;
      respective patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment (siremadlin in combination with venetoclax plus azacitidine) will be&#xD;
      administered in cycles with a planned duration of 28 days and will continue until the&#xD;
      participants experience disease progression/relapse or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Safety run-in part, 9-15 participants will be enrolled in each arms. Approximately 3-6&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at the starting dose level of siremadlin in combination with&#xD;
      venetoclax plus azacitidine in both arms independently. Provided the starting dose level is&#xD;
      determined to be safe, approximately 6-9 additional participants will be enrolled at dose&#xD;
      level +1. Safety review meetings will take place involving participating investigators and&#xD;
      the Sponsor Team to make decisions regarding siremadlin dose and determine the recommended&#xD;
      dose for expansion. Approximately 26 patients will be treated at the recommended dose in the&#xD;
      expansion part.&#xD;
