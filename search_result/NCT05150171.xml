  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study we will assess usability of a e-self-management program for patients with&#xD;
      hand osteoarthritis through the Happy Hands app. People with hand osteoarthritis will be&#xD;
      recruited for the study. The e-self-management intervention consists of informational videos&#xD;
      and videos of hand exercises and has a duration of 12 weeks. Patient-reported outcomes and&#xD;
      grip strength will be collected before and after the 12 week intervention period. Change in&#xD;
      pain, stiffness, grip strength, disease activity and quality indicators will be assessed&#xD;
      after 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with hand osteoarthritis will be recuited from The Norwegian Rheumatism&#xD;
      Association, Diakonhjemmet Hospital and Ankerl√∏kka Legesenter (general practitioner).&#xD;
      Patients will be summoned for an appointment at Diakonhjemmet or another suitable place for&#xD;
      testing of grip strength and instructions on how to download the app. The e-self-management&#xD;
      intervention is a 12 week intervention delivered through the Happy Hands app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app is developed based on a combination of behavioural change techniques informed by&#xD;
      Social cognitive theory26 and the EULAR recommendations on management of hand OA2. The&#xD;
      12-week intervention consists of 25 short informational videos addressing the themes&#xD;
      prioritized by the patient research partners. These themes are further operationalized into&#xD;
      the following categories: &quot;Information on hand OA&quot;, &quot;Hand exercises&quot;, &quot;Use of assistive&#xD;
      devices and orthoses&quot;, &quot;Medication and surgical alternatives&quot;, and &quot;Self-management of the&#xD;
      disease&quot;. Additionally, the intervention includes a hand exercise program consisting of 8&#xD;
      videos providing instructions on warm up, exercises to improve mobility, strength and&#xD;
      coordination, and a stretching exercise. The informational videos and exercise program are&#xD;
      delivered in a progressive order across the 12 weeks. When downloading the app, participants&#xD;
      are asked to specify when they plan to use the app (three days a week with time points).&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients get a notification on their smartphone with that week's informational&#xD;
      videos and hand exercises on the specified days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each exercise session patients are asked to rate their pain and stiffness, and these&#xD;
      answers are put into graphs visualising the development over the 12-week intervention period.&#xD;
      Each month, patients also answer questions about hand function, which they can use to&#xD;
      self-monitor their development across the intervention period. Encouragement and motivational&#xD;
      messages are provided each week to enhance continued adherence to the intervention.&#xD;
      Additionally, at the end of each week the patients are asked questions related to the&#xD;
      informational videos they have seen that week for the purpose of promoting self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to assess the change in quality indicators from baseline to 12 weeks&#xD;
      follow-up. Secondary aims are to assess the change in pain, stiffness, activity performance&#xD;
      and grip strength from baseline to follow-up, and to assess the use of and adherence to the&#xD;
      content of the app.&#xD;
