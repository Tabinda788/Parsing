  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effect of TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) as&#xD;
      add-on treatment compared with conventional analgesic treatment in patients with&#xD;
      endometriosis-related chronic pain. Patients with frequent pain and high pain intensity will&#xD;
      be randomized to additional treatment with TENS or conventional treatment for 8 weeks to&#xD;
      evaluate the acute effects of TENS treatment (n=40). Patients with endometriosis-related pain&#xD;
      that is not frequent or without high pain intensity constitute an external control group. All&#xD;
      patients in the study will receive TENS treatment for a total of 16 weeks, for evaluation of&#xD;
      long-term effects of TENS treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis affects approximately one in ten women of childbearing age and may involve both&#xD;
      acute pain related to the menstrual cycle and chronic pain. Usual analgesic therapy is often&#xD;
      inadequate and/or involves unacceptable side effects and risks with long-term use.&#xD;
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a patient controlled treatment for pain&#xD;
      relief with few side-effects. To date there is limited knowledge of how TENS treatment should&#xD;
      be carried out for optimal pain relief in this patient group. The aim of the study is asses&#xD;
      the effect of TENS as add-on treatment compared with conventional analgesic treatment in&#xD;
      patients with endometriosis-related chronic pain. Patients with frequent pain and high pain&#xD;
      intensity (≥ 4 according to Numeric Rating Scale, NRS) will be randomized to additional&#xD;
      treatment with TENS or conventional treatment for 8 weeks in order to evaluate the acute&#xD;
      effects of TENS treatment (n=40). Patients with endometriosis-related pain that is not&#xD;
      frequent or without high pain intensity constitute an external control group. All patients in&#xD;
      the study will receive TENS treatment for a total of 16 weeks, for evaluation of long-term&#xD;
      effects of TENS treatment in chronic endometriosis-related pain. Prior to start of TENS&#xD;
      treatment, all patients receive education on chronic endometriosis-related pain and TENS&#xD;
      treatment. Study participants will be asked to participate in a qualitative follow-up within&#xD;
      the study including a semi-structured individual interview (n=10-15) before intervention and&#xD;
      a semi-structured focus group (n=9-15) interview after completion of TENS treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) assessed with EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with EQ-5D-5L. The questionnaire comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
