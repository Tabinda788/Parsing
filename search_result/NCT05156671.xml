  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is designed as a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, interventional trial to assess safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      Adrecizumab (on top of SOC) in patients with COVID-19, and to evaluate if improvement of&#xD;
      vascular integrity with Adrecizumab on top of SOC is superior to placebo/ control substance&#xD;
      (NaCl 0.9%) on top of SOC in reduction of morbidity and mortality endpoints in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reason for admission to ICU and need for mechanical ventilation of these patients is&#xD;
      acute lung injury within a broad pneumonic spectrum, increased ventricular filling pressures&#xD;
      and resulting congestion. It is hypothesized, that Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a key player in&#xD;
      the (dys)-regulation of vascular integrity (Figure 2). Adrecizumab is the first-in-class&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal anti-Adrenomedullin antibody, and acts as a long-lasting plasma&#xD;
      Adrenomedullin enhancer stabilizing barrier function at a reasonable safety profile. The mode&#xD;
      of action for the anti-Adrenomedullin antibody Adrecizumab has been developed on the basis of&#xD;
      published data, own experimental data and theoretical considerations.&#xD;
