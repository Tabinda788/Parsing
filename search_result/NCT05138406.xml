    <textblock>
      This study was planned to investigate the long-term effectiveness of the early application of&#xD;
      graded motor imagery therapy on pain parameters, functional performance, motor imagery skill,&#xD;
      and kinesiophobia in individuals who underwent total knee arthroplasty surgery after knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants aged 45-80 who are scheduled for total knee arthroplasty surgery after knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis will be included. Participants will be selected from the relevant population&#xD;
      using a nonprobability random sampling method. Participants who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study and meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to one of the groups (conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation-only or conventional rehabilitation with graded motor imagery) using the&#xD;
      closed envelope method. Evaluations will be made one day before surgery, 6 weeks and 6 months&#xD;
      after surgery for each group. Pain Visual Analog Scale; pressure pain threshold algometer;&#xD;

    <description>It will be evaluated with the Central Sensitization Inventory. It consists of 2 parts, part A, which evaluates the symptoms thought to be associated with central sensitization syndromes, and part B, which quickly questions whether the patient has received a specific diagnosis before. In part A, there are 25 items that question the frequency of symptoms seen in central sensitization syndromes and are scored between 0-100 points. Each symptom is defined as &quot;never&quot; (0 points) if the patient never experiences that symptom, &quot;rarely&quot; (1 point) if rarely, &quot;sometimes&quot; if sometimes (2 points), &quot;frequently&quot; (3 points) if often It is recorded as &quot;always&quot; (4 points). As the patient's central sensitization inventory score increases, it is thought that he has more symptoms related to central sensitization. In part B, it is questioned whether the patient has ever been diagnosed with any of the diseases included in the central sensitization syndromes by any physician.</description>

    <description>It is a questionnaire that evaluates the imagery of four movements consisting of knee bending, jumping, arm movement and bending. It consists of three subscales and a total of 12 items evaluating external visual imagery, internal visual imagery, and kinesthetic imagery. Before starting the questionnaire, participants are given definitions of external visual imagery, internal visual imagery, and kinesthetic imagery. Before scoring each movement, the person is asked to perform the movement, then the movement is visualized three times. It is scored on a scale from 1 to 7. 1 point means &quot;very difficult to see/feel&quot;, while 7 points means &quot;very easy to see/feel&quot;.</description>
