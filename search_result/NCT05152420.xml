      A single centre, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study in&#xD;
      healthy subjects conducted in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Single ascending doses in healthy subjects aged 18 to 49 years to assess safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of VMX-C001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Healthy subjects aged 50 to 79 years to assess safety, PK and PD effects of VMX-C001&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In Part 1, men and women of any ethnic origin aged between 18 and 49 years of age,&#xD;
             inclusive, at the time of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In Part 2, men and women of any ethnic origin aged between 50 and 79 years of age,&#xD;
             inclusive, at the time of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male subjects must be willing to use appropriate contraception, such as a condom, and&#xD;
             to refrain from sperm donation during the study and until 90 days after study drug&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Women of child-bearing potential must agree not to attempt to become pregnant and to&#xD;
             use a highly effective form of birth control during the study and for 90 days after&#xD;
             study drug administration when their sexual partner has not been vasectomized. Highly&#xD;
             effective forms of birth control entail the use of combined (estrogen- and&#xD;
             progestogen-containing) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
             inhibition of ovulation, an intrauterine device (IUD), an intrauterine&#xD;
             hormone-releasing system (IUS) or abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Postmenopausal women must have had ≥12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (with&#xD;
             documented follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥30 milli-International units (mIU)/mL).&#xD;

             oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, the&#xD;
             reproductive status of the woman has to be confirmed by follow-up hormone level&#xD;
             assessment. Women who are surgically sterile must provide documentation of the&#xD;
             procedure by an operative report or by ultrasound.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. The participant requires or has taken during the month prior to first administration&#xD;
             of study drug or DOAC, vitamin K for therapeutic reasons. Vitamin K not taken for&#xD;

             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The participant has used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including&#xD;

             compromise safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The participant is currently participating in a clinical study, e.g. attending&#xD;

             limit of normal (ULN) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤60&#xD;
             mL/minute).&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. The participant has active liver disease (ALT/ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;1.5x&#xD;
             ULN, total bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN at Screening or on Day -1. One re-test is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;

             clarithromycin, erythromycin and azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole,&#xD;
             itraconazole, voriconazole and osaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors.) within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to first administration of DOAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Because of an effect on DOACs, participants are to be excluded if he/she receives or&#xD;
             has received treatment with CYP3A4 inducers (eg St. John's wort, rifampicin,&#xD;
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital within 30 days prior to first administration&#xD;
             of DOAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Because of an effect on DOACs, participants are to be excluded if he/she receives or&#xD;
             has received treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or&#xD;
             selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) within 30 days prior to first&#xD;
             administration of DOAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. The participant has any contra-indication to treatment with DOACs.&#xD;
