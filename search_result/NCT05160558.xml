  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple&#xD;
      ascending doses of BIIB132 administered via intrathecal (IT) injection to participants with&#xD;
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). The secondary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      characterize the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB132 administered via IT injection&#xD;
      to participants with SCA3.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BIIB132 is an investigational anti-sense oligonucleotide developed to target ataxin-3 (ATXN3)&#xD;
      pre-messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA). Preclinical studies have shown that lowering of&#xD;
      ATXN3 protein is associated with decreased progression of SCA3-like disease. This trial&#xD;
      consists of a blinded 12 week study period with a 26 week follow up period to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of intrathecal BIIB132 and to assess the effect on treatment response&#xD;
      biomarkers in symptomatic SCA3 participants.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a-life threatening event), requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>
