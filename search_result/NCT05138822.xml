  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1b study is a double-blind, double-dummy, nitrofurantoin-controlled study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate microbiological response at the test of cure (ToC) visit along with safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) response following daily oral dosing for 5 days of&#xD;
      GSK3882347 in an adult female with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI). Comparator&#xD;
      nitrofurantoin will be included in the study to ensure unbiased reporting of safety events.&#xD;
      The study will be separated into 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 consists of an inpatient treatment&#xD;
      period and PK analysis at frequent timepoints. Cohort 2 includes an outpatient treatment&#xD;
      period and PK analysis conducted less frequently, at key trough timepoints.&#xD;
