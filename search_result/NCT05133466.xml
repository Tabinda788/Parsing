  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that breast milk exerts many positive effects on the general health, growth&#xD;
      and development of infants. When breastfeeding is not possible, infant formula is considered&#xD;
      to be an effective substitute to satisfy the regular nutritional demand of infants. At&#xD;
      present, researchers make every effort to simulate the nutritional status of breast milk but&#xD;
      mostly neglect the important role that odour plays in guiding the baby to recognize breast&#xD;
      milk, promoting the baby's sucking behavior and food intake. The odour changes of the breast&#xD;
      milk are so far mainly related to storage, lactational stage and maternal diet. To understand&#xD;
      the odour characteristics of the human breast milk from different regions in China, 90&#xD;
      mothers will be recruited from three Chinese cities: Beijing, Chengdu and Wuxi, representing&#xD;
      three typical regions with very different climate characteristics and diet habits. The breast&#xD;
      milk samples as well as infant formulas will be analyzed using the identical state of the art&#xD;
      separation and identification techniques to identify the odorous compounds, determine their&#xD;
      concentrations in the breast milk and infant formula as well as determine their importance in&#xD;
      contributing to the total odour of samples. The final objective of this study will be to&#xD;
      mimic the odour of the breast milk and to understand the difference of breast milk odour from&#xD;
      different regions with very different climate and diet composition, as well as to identify&#xD;
      the odour deviation of the infant formula from the breast milk. Our results will provide&#xD;
      references for the preparation of new infant formula with both nutritional ingredents and&#xD;
      odour characteristics simulating that of breast milk.&#xD;
