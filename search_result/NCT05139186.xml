  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of mortality among neoplastic&#xD;
      diseases in the world[1] . Adequate colonoscopy based CRC screening programs have proved to&#xD;
      be the key to reduce the risk of mortality, by early diagnosis of existing CRC and detection&#xD;
      of pre-cancerous lesions[2-4] . Nevertheless, long-term effectiveness of colonoscopy is&#xD;
      influenced by a range of variables that make it far from a perfect tool[5]. The effectiveness&#xD;
      of a colonoscopy mainly depends on its quality, which in turn is dependent on the skill and&#xD;
      expertise of the endoscopist. In fact, several studies have shown a significant adenoma miss&#xD;
      rate of 24%-35%, especially in patients with diminutive adenomas[6,7] . These data are in&#xD;
      line with interval cancers incidence (I-CRC), defined as the percentage of cancers diagnosed&#xD;
      after a screening program and before the intended surveillance duration, of approximately&#xD;
      3%-5% [8,9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the medical field has&#xD;
      grown in interest in the past decade. Its performance on increasing automatic polyp and&#xD;
      adenoma detection has shown promising results in order to achieve an higher ADR[10]. The use&#xD;
      of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) for detection of polyps had initially been studied in ex&#xD;
      vivo studies but in the last few years, with the advancement in computer aided technology and&#xD;
      emergence of deep learning algorithms, use of AI during colonoscopy has been achieved and&#xD;
      more studies have been undertaken [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently Fujifilm (Tokyo, Japan) has developed a new technology known as &quot;CAD-EYE&quot; aiming to&#xD;
      support both colonic polyp detection and characterization during colonoscopy. This technology&#xD;
      is now available in Europe, being compatible with the latest generation of Fujifilm&#xD;
      endoscopes (ELUXEO Fujifilm Co.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the clinical impact of CAD-EYE system in improving the adenoma detection have yet to&#xD;
      be assessed&#xD;
