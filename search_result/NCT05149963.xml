  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loneliness is a significant problem for young people and is associated with a range of&#xD;
      physical and mental health difficulties. Meta-analyses have identified that interventions&#xD;
      aimed at young people who report loneliness as their primary problem are lacking within the&#xD;
      literature. In adults, the most effective interventions for loneliness are those which target&#xD;
      the underlying maladaptive social cognitions. Therefore, the investigators have developed a&#xD;
      modular Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) intervention for children and young people aiming&#xD;
      to reduce their feelings of loneliness. The aim of this study is to conduct a multiple&#xD;
      baseline single-case experimental design (SCED) to assess the efficacy, feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of this intervention. In total 6-8 11-18-year-olds and their families will be&#xD;
      recruited. The design consists of AB+ post-intervention, where A is the baseline phase, B is&#xD;
      the intervention phase and then a post-intervention phase. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      baseline assessment, before being randomised to one of four different baseline lengths (12&#xD;
      days, 19 days, 26 days or 33 days). Participants will then complete an average of 12 sessions&#xD;
      of CBT, with the aim being to reduce their feelings of loneliness over 12 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will then complete a 12-day post-intervention phase. Participant loneliness will be&#xD;
      repeatedly assessed throughout the three phases of the intervention using the Three-item&#xD;
      Loneliness Scale, which will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will be reliable and&#xD;
      clinically meaningful change on the UCLA-LS-3, RCADS and SDQ. Feasibility and participant&#xD;
      satisfaction will also be assessed and reported.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of CBT for loneliness in children and young people will be evaluated through a&#xD;
      randomised multiple-baseline single case experimental design. The design consists of AB+&#xD;
      post-intervention, where A is the baseline phase, B is the intervention phase and then a&#xD;
      post-intervention phase. In the SCED approach participants are repeatedly assessed on at&#xD;
      least one independent variable, in this case self-reported loneliness on the Three-item&#xD;
      Loneliness Scale, across each phase of the intervention. This repeated measurement and within&#xD;
      subject replication is then used to test the effects of the intervention for individual&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The construction of this SCED trial and the reporting of the results will be in accordance&#xD;
      with the Single-Case Reporting Guidelines in Behavioural Intervention (SCRIBE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via advertisements emailed to schools, shared via social media&#xD;
      and word of mouth. After consenting, participants and their parents/carers will complete a&#xD;
      baseline eligibility assessment. Participants will complete a range of online questionnaires&#xD;
      via a secure online platform. Participants will then attend a remote research assessment&#xD;
      appointment to determine whether the family meet the eligibility criteria. The researcher&#xD;
      completing the baseline and post-intervention assessments will not be involved in the&#xD;
      clinical intervention and will be blinded to baseline allocation. After all baseline&#xD;
      assessments for the participant group are completed, participants will be discussed within&#xD;
      supervision to confirm that the participants meet eligibility criteria. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will then be randomised using a random number generator to one of four different baseline&#xD;
      lengths (12 days, 19 days, 26 days or 33 days). The decision to have a minimum of 12&#xD;
      observations per phase meets the requirements for guidelines and standards and will allow for&#xD;
      sufficient power for Tau-U analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the participating families will then be contacted to inform them of their allocation.&#xD;
      Randomisation and contacting of the families will be completed by a third researcher, who is&#xD;
      not involved in either the clinical intervention or research assessments. A letter will also&#xD;
      be sent to the participants General Practitioner (GP) informing them of the family's&#xD;
      participation in the research study. The setting for the entire study will be remote, with&#xD;
      both assessments and intervention sessions being conducted remotely a secure video platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the group will begin their baseline phase concurrently. During the&#xD;
      baseline phase participants will be asked to complete the Three-Item Loneliness Scale each&#xD;
      day via a secure online platform. SMS message reminders will also be sent to the participants&#xD;
      and their parent/carers each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baselines phase will be immediately followed by the intervention. Each family will&#xD;
      receive (on average) 12 sessions of CBT for loneliness in children and young people. The&#xD;
      first 4 sessions will take place bi-weekly, the second 4 sessions weekly and the final 4&#xD;
      sessions fortnightly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants the first two sessions will be focussed on assessment and then&#xD;
      formulation. The final session for all participants will focus on relapse prevention. During&#xD;
      the assessment session the participant will be asked to define 3 goal-based outcomes for how&#xD;
      participants hope the intervention will reduce their loneliness, which will then guide the&#xD;
      treatment process. During the intervention phase the participants will complete routine&#xD;
      outcome measures (ROMs) for each session. This will include the Three-Item Loneliness Scale,&#xD;
      visual analogue scales (VAS) of mood, anxiety and loneliness and ratings of their goal-based&#xD;
      outcomes. The ROMs will be completed via a secure online platform before each session. If&#xD;
      participants have not completed the ROMs before their appointment, then participants will be&#xD;
      completed with the clinician at the start of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will begin the post-intervention phase immediately after the final session of&#xD;
      their intervention. During the post-intervention phase participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure, Three-Item Loneliness Scale each day for 12 days. Participants&#xD;
      will then complete their post-intervention assessment with the second researcher. Before the&#xD;
      assessment participants will be asked to re-complete the baseline questionnaires in addition&#xD;
      to the parent and child-report versions of the Experience of Service Questionnaire and a&#xD;
      questionnaire asking whether COVID-19 or any other events have affected their loneliness&#xD;
      during the intervention period. A letter will be sent to the participants General&#xD;
      Practitioner (GP) informing them of their participation in the research study has finished.&#xD;
