      Title of Study: An Open-Label, Balanced, Randomized, 2-Treatment, 2-Sequence, 2-Period,&#xD;
      Single Dose, Crossover Oral Bioequivalence Study of Two Formulations of Fingolimod Capsules&#xD;
      (3 x 0.5 mg) in Healthy Adult Human Subjects Under Fasting Conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study is to compare the oral bioavailability and&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of the test formulation relative to that of&#xD;
      reference formulation in healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting conditions and to&#xD;
      assess the bioequivalence.&#xD;
