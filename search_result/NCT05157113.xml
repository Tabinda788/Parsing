  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current postoperative cataract surgery eye drop regimen used at Zuckerberg San Francisco&#xD;
      General Hospital (ZSFG) is a significant burden for its patient population, contributing to&#xD;
      high rates of non-adherence and the development of postoperative complications. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to replace this complex regimen with a single administration of&#xD;
      intraocular antibiotic and subconjunctival steroid at the time of surgery. This pilot study&#xD;
      will obtain the preliminary data required to eventually fully evaluate this innovation in&#xD;
      postoperative care in a safety-net population with respect to postoperative outcomes, patient&#xD;
      compliance, and patient and caregiver satisfaction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Frequent postoperative drop usage is a burden for vulnerable or indigent patients, who face&#xD;
      significant barriers in maintaining standard postoperative regimens, contributing to higher&#xD;
      rates of postoperative drop noncompliance and complications. Currently, patients undergoing&#xD;
      cataract surgery at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, a safety-net county hospital,&#xD;
      are started on a standard regimen of several different eye drops as part of routine&#xD;
      postoperative recovery from cataract surgery and prophylaxis against the most troubling known&#xD;
      postsurgical complications: endophthalmitis (devastating intraocular infection) and cystoid&#xD;
      macular edema (CME; fluid collections in the retina causing distortion of visual acuity). On&#xD;
      an internal review of clinic data, approximately 40% of patients undergoing cataract surgery&#xD;
      at ZSFG are non-adherent or only partially adherent with postoperative eye drops due to a&#xD;
      variety of causes, including difficulty instilling drops, remembering or understanding the&#xD;
      drop regimen, and keeping physical track of multiple bottles without losing them or having&#xD;
      them stolen. As the prevalence of comorbid ocular pathologies requiring separate chronic drop&#xD;
      therapy (such as glaucoma) is high in this population, these difficulties are compounded with&#xD;
      increasing numbers of eye drops and high frequency and complexity of the drop regimens.&#xD;
      Together, these challenges have led to a frustrating rate of postoperative complications in&#xD;
      this clinic population, particularly the rate of CME, which is approximately twice the&#xD;
      national rate. Identifying a postoperative regimen that is feasible for surgeons, convenient&#xD;
      for patients, and effective in preventing postoperative complications is therefore imperative&#xD;
      particularly for this vulnerable cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent retrospective studies suggest that single injections of cefuroxime and triamcinolone&#xD;
      acetonide within the eye at the time of surgery is safe and noninferior to standard drop&#xD;
      regimens in preventing postoperative complications among non-indigent patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that this dropless regimen would have several important benefits in&#xD;
      this cohort of vulnerable patients: increases in patient and caregiver satisfaction,&#xD;
      improvements in adherence with other treatment plans within the first postoperative month&#xD;
      when not burdened with postoperative drops, and a more desirable overall cost effectiveness&#xD;
      for all payers. The investigators further estimate that the regimen may actually be superior&#xD;
      to the standard regimen in preventing postoperative complications in this population, given&#xD;
      the high rate of patient non-adherence to the standard postoperative care. By employing a&#xD;
      prospective, crossover design randomizing the eyes of patients requiring bilateral sequential&#xD;
      cataract surgery to either the standard drop regimen or the dropless technique and following&#xD;
      the outcomes through the first postoperative month, the investigators aim to demonstrate a&#xD;
      significant improvement in patient and caregiver satisfaction, and adherence to all&#xD;
      medications during the postoperative period of patients receiving the dropless regimen as&#xD;
      compared to patients receiving the standard regimen. Additionally, in this initial small&#xD;
      pilot, the investigators anticipate demonstrating a trend towards superiority in prevention&#xD;
      of adverse post-surgical outcomes in the dropless cohort.&#xD;
