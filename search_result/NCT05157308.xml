  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is associated with a wide variety of metabolic changes in the body. Ascites,&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, renal dysfunction, and hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      are the most widely recognised complications in cirrhosis. Malnutrition and muscle wasting&#xD;
      (sarcopenia) constitute common complications, which are generally overlooked, but which&#xD;
      negatively impact the survival, quality of life, and response to stressors like infections,&#xD;
      sepsis and surgery in cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhotic patients with sarcopenia and myosteatosis have a higher risk of overt hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and hyperammonemia.1 It has also been shown that the patients with sarcopenia&#xD;
      have a lower overall survival than those without sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to study the prevalence of myosteatosis and sarcopenia in&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients, and to compare the clinical and anthropometric parameters for sarcopenia&#xD;
      and myosteatosis to that of imaging parameters (CT based diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that myosteatosis and sarcopenia can be estimated better with the use of CT&#xD;
      scan as compared with clinical assessment and hence, may help in early diagnosis of these&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

      All the patients of liver cirrhosis who attend the Liver clinic of the hospital will undergo&#xD;
      a thorough history and examination. After strict inclusion-exclusion criteria patients will&#xD;
      be included in the study. All routine investigations required to establish the etiology of&#xD;
      cirrhosis and to evaluate the stage of cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh status and MELD score)&#xD;
      would be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be assessed for the following anthropometric measurements -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated. In patients with Ascites- Dry body weight (kg)&#xD;
           will be taken by- Post-paracentesis weight (kg) recorded before fluid retention (if&#xD;
           available). OR Subtracting a percentage of weight based upon the severity of ascites&#xD;
           (Mild Ascites- 5%, Moderate- 10%, Severe- 15%) with an additional 5% subtracted if&#xD;
           bilateral pedal oedema is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mid- arm circumference (MUAC) - is the circumference of the left upper arm, measured at&#xD;
           the mid-point between the tip of the shoulder and the tip of the elbow (olecranon&#xD;
           process and the acromium). Normal value is 29.3 in males and 28.5 mm in females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Triceps Skin fold thickness - assessed in the mid arm using skin fold callipers. Normal&#xD;
           values in adults are usually 12.5 mm in males and 16.5 mm in female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mid-arm Muscle circumference (MAMC) - defined as (mid arm circumference - triceps skin&#xD;
           fold) x 0.314. Normal values in are 25.3 mm and 23.2 mm in adult males and females&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assessed for the indicators of muscle strength by-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 6 min walk Test - It measures the distance that patients can quickly walk in a flat,&#xD;
           hard surface within 6 minute. Values &gt; 300 m in 6 min is considered normal, while &lt; or&#xD;
           equal to 300 is considered low endurance while &lt; 250m indicates frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Balancing test - It is measured as the number of seconds that the subject can balance in&#xD;
           three positions (feet placed side-to-side, semi-tandem, and tandem) for a maximum of 10&#xD;
           seconds each. The duration is recorded for each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Five times sit to stand test - The subject is to sit in the chair with arms crossed over&#xD;
           his/her chest and then to stand up as quickly as possible safely, five times without&#xD;
           using his/her arms. Normal person should be able to do it within 12 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hand Grip test - It is a function of skeletal muscle contractile strength. It would be&#xD;
           tested using a hand held dynamometer and the average of three readings the subject's&#xD;
           dominant hand would be taken. The same would be compared with the normative data for the&#xD;
           age and sex of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Short physical performance battery - which consists of timed repeated chair stands,&#xD;
           balance testing, and a timed 13-ft walk&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Liver frailty index - calculated based upon HG, and balancing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the anthropometric and bedside maneuvers, patient will be subjected to plain Computed&#xD;
      tomographic (CT) scan of abdomen. CT image analysis at the L3 vertebra is almost universally&#xD;
      recognised as a specific method to quantify muscle loss. It will be done to assess the degree&#xD;
      of sarcopenia and myosteatosis as per the criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total cross sectional area cm2 of abdominal skeletal muscle normalized to height =&#xD;
           skeletal muscle index ( cm2/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cut off for sarcopenia: 50 cm2/m2 (male) and 39 cm2/m2 (Female) It has been established&#xD;
           to have an independent association with pooled transplantation mortality - HR : 1.84&#xD;
           independent of MELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cut-off for myosteatosis will be taken as Skeletal muscle radiation attenuation (SM-RA)&#xD;
           &lt;41 HU for patients with a body mass index [BMI] up to 24.9 kg/m2 and &lt;33 HU for&#xD;
           patients with a BMI â‰¥25 kg/m2.&#xD;
