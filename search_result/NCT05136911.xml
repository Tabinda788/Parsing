  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      culturally-tailored low-sodium dietary intervention is South Asian Canadians with stage one&#xD;
      HTN. Specific objectives are to determine the feasibility (recruitment, retention, engagement&#xD;
      and acceptability) of this intervention. Secondary outcomes include the effect of low-sodium&#xD;
      dietary intervention on knowledge, attitude and self-regulation behaviours. Exploratory&#xD;
      outcomes include its effect of systolic, diastolic blood pressure and sodium intake.&#xD;
      Information obtained from this pilot trial will inform design of a larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in reducing BP in South Asian Canadians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.&#xD;
      Hypertension (HTN) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. According to HTN&#xD;
      Canada guidelines, HTN is classified as pre-hypertension (systolic BP of 120-139 mmHg or&#xD;
      diastolic BP of 80-89 mmHg), stage one HTN ( systolic BP 140-159 mmHg or diastolic BP 90-99&#xD;
      mmHg) and stage two HTN (greater than or equal to systolic BP of 160 mmHg or greater than or&#xD;
      equal to diastolic BP of 100 mmHg) (2). Any increase in blood pressure above optimal confers&#xD;
      independent risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, atrial fibrillation and retinopathy. South&#xD;
      Asian individuals have significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is prevalent in South Asian Canadians with prevalence&#xD;
      rate of 17%. Hypertension is a result of various factors, which include excessive alcohol&#xD;
      consumption. lack of dietary potassium, physical inactivity, obesity and high dietary sodium&#xD;
      intake. High dietary sodium consumption is an important contributor to HTN. and the rapid&#xD;
      increase in dietary sodium is contributing to the current epidemic of HTN and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Sodium has a positive linear causal relationship to blood pressure based on&#xD;
      epidemiological and experimental studies. Sodium intake greater than 2300mg/day has been&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of developing HTN. In addition to HTN, excess sodium intake&#xD;
      is associated with higher risk of developing dementia, osteoporosis, stomach cancer, left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. The average sodium intake of Canadians is&#xD;
      currently estimated at 2760mg/day, which is well above the recommended daily intake of&#xD;
      2300mg/day. South Asians consume significantly higher amounts of sodium with more than 95% of&#xD;
      South Asians add salt to their cooking. Sodium intake in South Asians has been reported in&#xD;
      different countries as; 3456 mg/day in Pakistan, 3548-3708 mg/day in India, 5863-10,000mg/day&#xD;
      in Bangladesh. Although dietary patterns vary considerably in South Asians, addition of salt&#xD;
      during food preparation and at the table are common practices across communities. The&#xD;
      combination of traditional as well as a western diet results in an increased amount of sodium&#xD;
      from conveniently available traditional meals, consumption of bread, pizza, pasta and other&#xD;
      processed foods, high sodium spices and addition of salt during cooking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions aimed at reducing dietary sodium reduces blood pressure as well as&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the known benefits of sodium reduction&#xD;
      interventions in reducing blood pressure in the Caucasian population, there is limited&#xD;
      research available to provide evidence that sodium reduction is beneficial in reducing blood&#xD;
      pressure in South Asian Canadians with stage one HTN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the South Asian Low-sodium Trial (SALT) is to assess feasibility&#xD;
      (recruitment, retention, engagement and acceptability) of implementing a six-week low-sodium&#xD;
      community-based dietary intervention in South Asian Canadians with stage one HTN. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include assessing knowledge &amp; attitude and self-regulation behaviours. Exploratory&#xD;
      objectives are to assess change in systolic BP, diastolic BP and sodium intake.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The recruitment was stopped due to province-wide lockdown secondary to COVID-19. Blood pressure&#xD;
    screenings were conducted in community centres and due to province wide lockdown, further&#xD;
    screenings could not be continued.&#xD;
