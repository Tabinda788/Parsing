  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZYN002 administered as a transdermal gel&#xD;
      formulation, for up to 38 weeks, in patients ages 4 to &lt; 18 years, in the treatment of&#xD;
      22q.11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22qDS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD) administered as ZYN002, a transdermal gel, for the treatment of child and adolescent&#xD;
      patients with 22qDS. Male and female patients with 22qDS will be treated in Period 1 for 14&#xD;
      weeks. Patients that meet study criteria will be allowed to continue to Period 2 for an&#xD;
      additional 24 weeks of treatment. At the end of study, patients taking antiepileptic drug&#xD;
      (AED) medication(s) will have an additional one or two week Taper Period. Approximately 20&#xD;
      male and female patients, ages 4 to &lt; 18 years, will receive ZYN002.&#xD;
