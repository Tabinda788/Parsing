      This study aimed to examine the effect of mobile phone-based distance video education given&#xD;
      to individuals with type 2 diabetes on metabolic variables and cognitive-social factors. This&#xD;
      study is a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of the study consisted of individuals with type 2 diabetes who presented to&#xD;
      hospital diabetes outpatient clinic between July 2018 and January 2019, and the study sample,&#xD;
      on the other hand, included a total of 100 individuals with type 2 diabetes who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study. The study was completed with a&#xD;
      total of 93 subjects, including 46 in the intervention group (n = 46) and 47 in the control&#xD;
      group (n= 47). A Diagnosis and Follow-up Form for Individuals with Diabetes&#xD;
      (socio-demographic characteristics, diabetes-related characteristics, metabolic values),&#xD;
      which was prepared by the researcher in line with the literature, and the Turkish&#xD;
      Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire (T-MDDQ) were used to collect the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation and content of the education material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The education material was based on four different guidelines, namely, educator's guidelines&#xD;
      for adults with diabetes; the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up guidelines for diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and its complications; diabetes diagnosis and treatment guidelines; and&#xD;
      international education guidelines for diabetes health professionals. The diabetes education&#xD;
      videos prepared and presented by the researcher in line with these resources were sent to the&#xD;
      participants' smartphones in parts. The educational content consisted of 8 sections: what is&#xD;
      diabetes? (basic concepts, symptoms, diagnostic criteria, importance), medical nutrition&#xD;
      therapy in diabetes, exercise therapy in diabetes, medical treatment in diabetes, acute&#xD;
      complications of diabetes, chronic complications of diabetes, foot problems in diabetes, life&#xD;
      with diabetes, and diabetes management under special cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group: In the first meeting, the individuals in the intervention group were&#xD;
      informed about the video-based diabetes education and how they would get the videos, and data&#xD;
      collection forms were administered. The blood analysis results (HbA1c, glucose, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride) taken on the same day during outpatient clinic&#xD;
      follow-ups were recorded. After the administration of the forms, blood pressure, height, and&#xD;
      weight measurements were made, and the first interview was completed. Following the first&#xD;
      interview, diabetes education videos created previously were sent to the mobile phones of the&#xD;
      individuals in two episodes a week fashion. Video submission was completed in a total of four&#xD;
      weeks. In the second interview, three months after the video submission had been completed,&#xD;
      data collection forms were re-administered to the individuals, and blood analysis results&#xD;
      were recorded. The interview was completed after measuring their blood pressure and weight.&#xD;
      During the period between the first and second interviews, the individuals continued to&#xD;
      receive routine outpatient follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group: In the first interview, the individuals with diabetes in the control group&#xD;
      were given information about the study, and then data collection forms were administered. The&#xD;
      blood analysis results (HbA1c, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride) taken on&#xD;
      the same day during outpatient clinic follow-ups were recorded. The first interview was&#xD;
      completed after blood pressure, height, and weight measurements were made. Later, individuals&#xD;
      continued to receive routine outpatient follow-ups without any other procedures. In the&#xD;
      second interview held three months later, data collection forms were re-administered, and&#xD;
      blood analysis results, blood pressure, and weight measurements were recorded. At the end of&#xD;
      the second interview, diabetes education videos were sent to the individuals in the control&#xD;
      group, too, and they were provided with the same education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) was&#xD;
      used to analyze the data. P&lt;.05 was accepted statistically significant. In descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, mean, ± standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values, and percentages&#xD;
      were used, and in nonparametric tests, Mann-Whitney U, Pearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test, McNemar's test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, and Spearman's rho measurements were&#xD;
      employed.&#xD;
