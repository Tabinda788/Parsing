    <textblock>
      30 pediatric patients aged 2-18 years receiving fluconazole as part of standard care for the&#xD;
      treatment or prophylaxis of an invasive fungal infection will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Between day 2 and 10, 6 samples will be collected on two days. In the case a patient switches&#xD;
      from oral to intravenous therapy, an additional PK-day consisting of 3 samples will be&#xD;
      scheduled. Fluconazole plasma concentrations will be determined. A pharmacokinetic model will&#xD;
      be fitted to the data from all individuals simultaneously. Data will be analysed using&#xD;
      non-linear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM). Monte Carlo simulations will guide the&#xD;
      establishment of an improved fluconazole dosing regimen for pediatric and adolescent&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluconazole has been available since 1990, however a limited number of studies addressed the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of fluconazole in children and adolescent patients. Solid PK data are&#xD;
      lacking, despite there being expected variation due to physiological differences with adults&#xD;
      likely resulting in significant clinical impact. Especially in the paediatric population&#xD;
      where fluconazole is extensively used, including in patients who have moderate to severe&#xD;
      renal function disturbances, this information is needed. Therefore, it seems prudent to&#xD;
      conduct a study in a cohort of paediatric patients who receive fluconazole as prophylaxis or&#xD;
      treatment. The primary objective of the study is to establish an improved fluconazole dosing&#xD;
      regimen for paediatric and adolescent patients aged 2-18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of pediatric 30 patients will be included in this observational PK-study. Patients&#xD;
      will receive standard fluconazole therapy according to (local) protocol. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected from already placed arterial or central venous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between day 2 and 10, six blood samples will be collected for the purpose of PK analysis.&#xD;
      Samples will be collected on two different days. On the first PK-day, 3 samples will be&#xD;
      collected on t = 0, 1, and 5 hours after fluconazole administration and on the second PK-day,&#xD;
      3 samples will be collected on t = 0.5, 3, and 7 hours after fluconazole administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is expected to switch from iv to oral therapy or vice versa within an&#xD;
      additional 30 days, the patient will remain in the study to collect data on absolute oral&#xD;
      bioavailability. An additional PK-curve of maximum 3 samples may be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations of fluconazole will be measured in all available samples by means of a&#xD;
      validated Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacokinetic model will be fitted to the data from all individuals simultaneously. Data&#xD;
      will be analysed using non-linear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM).After selection of the&#xD;
      final model, a simulation study is performed using this model to assess exposure following&#xD;
      various dosing regimens.&#xD;

        Pediatric patients aged 2-18 years treated with fluconazole for the prophylaxis or&#xD;
        management of an invasive fungal infection are eligble for inclusion. In total, 30 patients&#xD;
        will be included. Patients are treated as per local protocol. Only patients managed with a&#xD;
        CVC or arterial line from which blood can be obtained are included to ensure the&#xD;
        non-interventional nature of the study.&#xD;
