  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to test the benefits of a semi-automated tele-coaching program to coach adult&#xD;
      participants with chronic lung disease towards a more active lifestyle.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The level of physical activity (PA) has been shown to be an important predictor for morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in individuals with chronic respiratory diseases, for instance Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Physical&#xD;
      inactivity and sedentary behavior is a common feature of patients with chronic respiratory&#xD;
      diseases. Pulmonary rehabilitation is known as a beneficial intervention in exercise&#xD;
      capacity, disease symptoms and quality of life in respiratory diseases. Despite the overall&#xD;
      large benefits on exercise capacity and other variables described above, it does not&#xD;
      automatically translate into increases in PA. Recent literature shows that coaching programs&#xD;
      specifically aiming to increase PA are more likely to result in PA changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the impact of 3-month (12 weeks)&#xD;
      tele-coaching intervention on PA level of adult participants suffering from a chronic lung&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study group is divided into the intervention and control group. A randomisation was stratified according to the disease (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF). At first, the participants undergo an initial assessment including a respiratory muscle function and strength testing, physical activity measurement, fatigue, depression status, overall quality of life, disease status, exercise capacity and isometric quadriceps muscle strength testing. Both groups will receive information about the importance of being physically active and the PA recommendations provided by the World Health Organization (leaflet discussed in an education session (one-to-one) of 10-15 minutes). The intervention and control periods are followed by a final assessment (exactly the same as the initial one).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The participants are instructed to use a &quot;Fitbit&quot; fitness tracker to record the number of steps. This device is compatible with the &quot;m-PAC&quot; App, which was developed for this specific group of participants (individuals suffering from a chronic lung disease). The participants receive a feedback via the &quot;m-PAC&quot; App every day and they also receive a week report to be albe to adjust their step goal. They are asked to increase or keep their week goal every Sunday after reviewing a weekly report. The participants also receive tips for their PA improvement and they are asked for medication change specification (every Wednesday).</description>
