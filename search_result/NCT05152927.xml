  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess whether using PTeye (AiBiomed, Santa Barbara, CA) - a&#xD;
      NIRAF detection modality - can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare associated&#xD;
      costs after parathyroid surgeries. By being able to quickly and definitively locate&#xD;
      parathyroid glands while in the operating room, the duration of surgical procedure could be&#xD;
      further reduced. In addition, the number of frozen section biopsy and associated costs can be&#xD;
      minimized. Furthermore, repeat surgeries as a result of missing a diseased parathyroid gland&#xD;
      at the time of the initial parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism could potentially be&#xD;
      avoided.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized study comparing the use of PTeye during&#xD;
      parathyroidectomy to usual standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the impact of PTeye on intra-operative identification of parathyroid tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the impact of PTeye on improving efficiency of parathyroid surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the impact of PTeye on minimizing risk of post-surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either the experimental or control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will first take 5 baseline NIRAF measurements on the thyroid gland (or neck&#xD;
      muscles, if thyroid is absent) using the disposable sterile fiber probe that is connected to&#xD;
      the PTeye console, as per device functionality requirements. The subsequent step would&#xD;
      involve touching the target tissue in the neck with the fiber optic probe, following which&#xD;
      the PTeye will indicate to the surgeon if the tissue is likely parathyroid or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients assigned to the control arm, the surgeon will not use the PTeye and will proceed&#xD;
      with the parathyroid surgery as usual, while relying solely on her/his surgical experience in&#xD;
      identifying the parathyroid glands during the operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be follow-ed up for up to 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
