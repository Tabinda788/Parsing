  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 testing is essential to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic to break transmission&#xD;
      chains and reduce community transmission. However, Black and Latino/Hispanic populations in&#xD;
      lower status frontline essential occupations such as food preparation, retail, building&#xD;
      maintenance, personal services, and in-home health care have serious barriers to COVID-19&#xD;
      testing and, therefore, insufficient testing rates. The proposed study will use the&#xD;
      multiphase optimization strategy framework to address the problem of low COVID-19 testing&#xD;
      rates for this population: We will test the effects of four distinct candidate intervention&#xD;
      components and then create an efficient multicomponent made up of the most effective&#xD;
      combination of the components that can be rapidly scaled up in community settings to boost&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study responds to RFA-OD-21-008 which calls for community-engaged interventions&#xD;
      to support COVID-19 testing in underserved and vulnerable populations. Among those at highest&#xD;
      risk for exposure to COVID-19 is the large population of frontline essential workers (FEW) in&#xD;
      lower status occupations (e.g., retail, in-home health care), among whom Black and&#xD;
      Latino/Hispanic (BLH) persons are over-represented. The CDC recommends testing for all those&#xD;
      experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. For those not vaccinated, testing is recommended after&#xD;
      exposure to individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis, and regular COVID-19 screening testing is&#xD;
      recommended even when asymptomatic for those with frequent close contact with others in&#xD;
      indoor settings such as FEW. However, BLH-FEW experience serious impediments to COVID-19&#xD;
      testing at individual/attitudinal- (e.g., lack of knowledge of guidelines, distrust), social-&#xD;
      (e.g., social norms), and structural-levels of influence (e.g., poor access to testing).&#xD;
      Indeed, testing rates are lower among BLH than White populations and only 25-50% of BLH-FEW&#xD;
      are currently vaccinated. The proposed community-engaged study is led by a collaborative team&#xD;
      at New York University and the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation (NMIC). Its main&#xD;
      goal is to optimize a behavioral intervention to boost COVID-19 testing rates for BLH-FEW.&#xD;
      Consistent with RFA-OD-21-008, the proposed study uses the multiphase optimization strategy&#xD;
      (MOST) framework to test four candidate intervention components grounded in our past&#xD;
      research. The candidate components are informed by critical race theory and guided by the&#xD;
      theory of triadic influence, are brief or do not require substantial staff time, and will be&#xD;
      tested in a highly efficient factorial experimental design. They are A) motivational&#xD;
      interview counseling, B) a text message component grounded in behavioral economics, C) peer&#xD;
      education, and D) access to testing (via navigation to a test appointment vs. a self-test&#xD;
      kit). All participants receive the standard of care, namely, health education on COVID-19&#xD;
      testing, and referrals. The specific aims of the study are to: identify which of four&#xD;
      candidate components contribute meaningfully to improvement in the primary outcome, COVID-19&#xD;
      testing with medical confirmation; the most effective combination of components will comprise&#xD;
      the &quot;optimized&quot; intervention (Aim 1), identify mediators (e.g., distrust, access) and&#xD;
      moderators (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics) of the effects of each component (Aim 2),&#xD;
      and use a mixed-methods approach to explore relationships among barriers to, facilitators of,&#xD;
      and uptake of COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 vaccination (Aim 3). Participants will be N=448&#xD;
      BLH-FEW who have not been tested for COVID-19 in the past six months and who are not&#xD;
      vaccinated for COVID-19, randomly assigned to an intervention condition, and assessed at 6-&#xD;
      and 12-weeks post-baseline; N=50 participants will engage in qualitative in-depth interviews.&#xD;
      We will also uncover, describe, and plan for implementation issues so the optimized&#xD;
      intervention can be rapidly scaled up by NMIC and other community-based organizations.&#xD;

    <description>This intervention lasts 6 weeks. This component is grounded in principles of behavioral economics. Its main goal is to add interest and excitement to the goal of COVID-19 testing, serve as a reminder that COVID-19 testing is recommended in a number of scenarios, and &quot;nudge&quot; participants toward testing and creating a habit of serial screening and COVID-19 testing as needed. Participants first receive a brief orientation to the component (15 min.), and the participant will put the study phone number into his/her phone and a test TM and QQ will be sent. TMs and QQs are programmed into the Telerivet program and sent automatically. Twice a week participants will receive a TM with information about COVID and COVID-19 testing followed by a true/false question about that TM two days later, for which they earn 10 points for a correct answer, and 5 points for an incorrect answer. Participants earn modest prizes based on their points.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Peer education</intervention_name>
    <description>This component has two aspects: Participants are trained to educate their peers on core messages about the importance of COVID-19 testing that address social norms about COVID-19 testing and highlight COVID-19 testing as an altruistic act (15-20 min. training). Then, participants are given the opportunity to educate three peers who are Black and Latino/Hispanic frontline essential workers on the core messages. These peers contact the study directly and receive a brief assessment and referrals to testing, but are not enrolled in the study.</description>

    <description>Component D is an adaptive intervention component that avoids unnecessary costs; it is only provided if needed. Level 1: Over a 2-3 week period, navigation includes a brief needs assessment and guidance to assist participants in prioritizing, accessing, and completing COVID-19 testing sequences in a timely fashion and resolving barriers such as transportation or the possible need to take off work if diagnosed with COVID-19. Level 2: 1 month after enrollment, participants will be contacted by phone. If they have not been tested, we will provide them with a BinaxNOW test kit which can be picked up or mailed to them.</description>
