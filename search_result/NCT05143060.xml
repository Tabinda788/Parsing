      This study choosed good health, aged 18 ~ 25, physical standard, the glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      normal adults 12, oral glucose (reference) respectively in different periods, the valley of&#xD;
      fiber powder upgrade formula, perfect meals, by extraction shu cereal bars, light appearance&#xD;
      suits (by extraction shu compound dietary fiber powder, feeding combination 1:1) and 17&#xD;
      extraction enzyme 6 kinds of food, Venous blood was collected 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min&#xD;
      before and after oral administration respectively. Blood was collected for 7 times with 2mL&#xD;
      each. The plasma is then separated to determine glucose levels. Blood glucose was measured&#xD;
      within 3 h. With glucose as the reference, food glycemic index (GI) was calculated using the&#xD;
      internationally used Wolever method. Time was taken as abscissa and blood glucose value at&#xD;
      each time point was taken as ordinate to prepare the blood glucose response curve of each&#xD;
      food tested after eating. The elevated glycemic area (AUC) under the glycemic curve was&#xD;
      calculated geometrically, and the food GI and glycemic load (GL) values were calculated&#xD;
      according to the following formula: GI value = (2 h post-meal blood glucose AUC of the tested&#xD;
      food / 2 h post-meal glucose glucose AUC of the same amount of carbohydrate)×100,&#xD;
      GL=GI*M(100g of the actual available carbohydrate of a food)/100.&#xD;

      (I) Glucose test: twelve subjects began to fast at 10 PM the previous day, and 2mL of venous&#xD;
      blood was collected on an empty stomach in the morning of the next day, which was divided&#xD;
      into sodium fluoride anticoagulant tubes for measuring glucose. Then 25 g of pure glucose&#xD;
      powder was taken orally, and venous blood was taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min,&#xD;
      respectively. A total of 7 blood samples were collected, and 2mL of blood was collected each&#xD;
      time. Then the plasma was separated to determine the content of glucose, and the blood&#xD;
      glucose was measured within 3 h. In this study, venous indwelling needle was used to collect&#xD;
      blood, which can reduce repeated venous aspiration. About 2 mL of normal saline was left in&#xD;
      the indwelling needle to prevent blood clotting. Blood collection by an experienced nurse in&#xD;
      charge or supervising nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) Glucose response test of tested foods: Glucose test was conducted on the first day, and&#xD;
      different tested foods (see Table 2 and Table 3) were tested on the third, sixth or ninth day&#xD;
      respectively, with an interval of 2-3 days or more between the two foods. Specific dates were&#xD;
      arranged according to the test schedule. Twelve subjects fasted after 10:00 PM the previous&#xD;
      day, and 2mL of venous blood was taken on an empty stomach in the morning of the next day.&#xD;
      They ate the tested food (containing about 25g or 10g carbohydrates, as shown in Table 2 and&#xD;
      3) on different dates respectively. The eating methods were as follows: The upgraded sample&#xD;
      of grain fiber powder formula was washed and adjusted with 1:8 times of warm water at 60-70℃,&#xD;
      stirred for about 2min and turned into a slightly thickened state, then put it at the&#xD;
      palatability temperature and drink it. The perfect nutrition meal is rinsed with 1:6 times&#xD;
      hot water at about 70℃, stirred evenly for about 1min, and then put it to the palatability&#xD;
      temperature for drinking; Zhen Shu cereal bar pastry ready to eat in open bag; The nutritious&#xD;
      meal + compound dietary fiber powder (good mixing according to the ratio of 1:1) is rinsed at&#xD;
      1:6 times in hot water around 70℃, stirred evenly for about 1min, and then put it to the&#xD;
      palatability temperature for drinking; 17 light drink ferment drink directly after opening&#xD;
      the bag. Venous blood was taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes, and blood glucose was&#xD;
      measured within 3 hours. The blood collection method is the same as the above glucose test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Determination of plasma glucose: hexokinase method, with Beckman 5800 series automatic&#xD;
      biochemical analyzer and its reagent determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (4) Calculation of food GI: With glucose as the reference (GI=100), the internationally used&#xD;
      Wolever method was used to calculate food GI, with time as abscissa and blood sugar value at&#xD;
      each time point as ordinate Postprandial glucose response curve. The elevated glucose area&#xD;
      (AUC) under the glucose curve was calculated geometrically, and the food GI and GL values&#xD;
      were calculated according to the following formula: GI value = (2 h post-meal blood glucose&#xD;
      AUC of the tested food / 2 h post-meal glucose glucose AUC of the same amount of&#xD;
      carbohydrate)×100, GL=GI*M(100g of the actual available carbohydrate of a food)/100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (5) Quality control: (1) Formulate unified operation implementation methods and evaluation&#xD;
      standards to standardize the operation; (2) Laboratory inspection requirements: unified&#xD;
      methods, instruments and reagents; ③ Draw blood by experienced nurse in charge to ensure that&#xD;
      the drawing time and indwelling needle meet the requirements; (4) Statistical processing and&#xD;
      analysis methods of data were determined and implemented by statistical experts. Blood&#xD;
      glucose quality control charts were drawn. Unified maximum allowable line and warning limit&#xD;
      values were set according to the target value, and the measurement results should be within&#xD;
      the warning line. ⑤ Set up inspectors to supervise the quality of each special work; ⑥ This&#xD;
      study was in compliance with ethical standards, approved by the Ethics Committee of Sun&#xD;
      Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University for filing, and informed consent signed&#xD;
      by participating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (VI) Data processing: The internationally used Wolever method was used to calculate the food&#xD;
      GI. Using time as the abscissa and blood glucose values at each time point as the ordinate,&#xD;
      the post-meal glucose response curves of the tested food were prepared and GI and GL were&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
