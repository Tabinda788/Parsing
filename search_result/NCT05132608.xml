      The study is a two-arm open-label randomized controlled trial conducted among literate&#xD;

      pregnant women owning smartphone with internet connectivity in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      intervention (n=109) or usual care (n=120). The investigators assessed PNC knowledge in the&#xD;
      participants by interviewing in-person or via phone; questionnaire was adopted from the&#xD;
      previous study conducted to determine the knowledge of postnatal care among postpartum&#xD;
      mothers in Asmara; that contained 20 knowledge questions with a maximum possible score of 61.&#xD;
      The questionnaire was translated and pretested in Nepali, with the Cronbach alpa of 0.83. The&#xD;
      intervention group received a 16 minutes video developed by using Health belief model via&#xD;
      social media and the participants were reminded to view the video every week via telephone&#xD;
      for a month. Control group received usual care. The primary outcome of the study was PNC&#xD;
      knowledge score. The investigators utilized intent-to-treat analysis and measured the effect&#xD;
      of the intervention on PNC knowledge score using linear regression analysis.&#xD;
