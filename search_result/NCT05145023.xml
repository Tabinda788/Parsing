      What is the purpose of this research?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes two parts based in two NHS specialist centres for cardiac sarcoidosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of the CARD-SARC: Development of the new questionnaire to measure quality of&#xD;
           life in cardiac sarcoidosis patients (the CARD-SARC questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation of the CARD-SARC: Evaluation of how good the CARD-SARC questionnaire is at&#xD;
           measuring quality of life changes in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      What would taking part involve?&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, we would like to talk with a group of patients (between 6 to 20) about the impact of&#xD;
      cardiac sarcoidosis in their quality of life during an interview. We will review and analysed&#xD;
      these interviews. Then, we will compare with what is already know about cardiac sarcoidosis&#xD;
      and its impact on quality of life. Also, we will ask healthcare professionals working with&#xD;
      cardiac sarcoidosis patients to review our results. Finally, we will use this information to&#xD;
      create the first draft of the new questionnaire (CARD-SARC questionnaire)to measure quality&#xD;
      of life in cardiac sarcoidosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, we will ask 20 patients with cardiac sarcoidosis to complete the draft version of the&#xD;
      CARD-SARC questionnaire. Also, they will complete validated quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
      (for general population or sarcoidosis patients) and questionnaires that explore potential&#xD;
      symptoms of fatigue, anxiety and depression. We will compare an review these results to&#xD;
      confirm that the CARD-SARC questionnaire is ready for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, we will ask 100 cardiac sarcoidosis patients to complete the CARD-SARC questionnaire&#xD;
      and the validated questionnaires (for quality of life and potential sarcoidosis symptoms) to&#xD;
      evaluate how good the CARD-SARC is at measuring quality of life changes in cardiac&#xD;
      sarcoidosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will patients or the public help guide the research?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work has been influenced and designed with people living with cardiac sarcoidosis.&#xD;
      SarcoidosisUK, the UK sarcoidosis charity, has been supportive and engaged on this work.&#xD;
      Likewise, five expert patients with cardiac sarcoidosis have also agreed to lead, contribute&#xD;
      and advice on relevant aspects of the study, and to participate sharing the results to the&#xD;
      public, patients and professional groups.&#xD;

    <measure>To develop and validate a disease-specific HRQoL tool (CARD-SARC) for people diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-related research activities include semi-structured interviews for item generation (McMaster framework step 1 - item selection), field-testing for the development of the CARD-SARC questionnaire (McMaster framework step 3 - item reduction) and a pilot-testing for the validation of the CARD-SARC (steps 4-6 - determination of reliability, validity and responsiveness).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine reliability, validity and responsiveness of CARD-SARC</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Internal consistency to determine if the CARD-SARC can be used as questionnaire to measure longitudinal changes in HRQoL in CS patients.&#xD;
Test-retest reliability to determine the concordance of two separated self-administration of the CARD-SARC.&#xD;
Longitudinal construct validity to determine the correlation between changes in the CARD-SARC and an external measure over time.&#xD;
Index of responsiveness for the CARD-SARC.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess HRQoL in CS patients using two standardised HRQoL-tools: the 5-Levels of severity for the EuroQoL 5- Dimensions (EQ5D-5L) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring HRQoL using two generic HRQoL questionnaires:&#xD;
the EQ5D-5 consists of five dimensions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each with five levels of health response and a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0-100 (0 being the worst possible health imaginable and 100 being the best possible health imaginable).&#xD;
the SF-36 consists in eight scales eight dimension to measure two components: physical and mental summary scores ranging from 0-100. The physical component summary (PCS) includes physical functioning (10-items), role physical (4-items), bodily pain (2-items), general health (5-items). The mental component summary (MCS) includes vitality (4-items), social functioning (2-items), role emotional (3-items), mental health (5-items). Individual scores (0-100) can be obtained by weighted sums of the questions for each of the eight domains.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare HRQoL in CS patients against three (non-cardiac) sarcoidosis-specific PROMs: the Sarcoidosis Health Questionnaire (SHQ), the King's Sarcoidosis Questionnaire (KSQ) and the formatted version of the Sarcoidosis Assessment Tool (SAT).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SHQ contains 29-items covering three domains: daily functioning, physical functioning, and emotional functioning. The responses range from &quot;all of the time&quot; (score of 1) to &quot;none of the time&quot; (score of 7). Higher score indicate better HRQoL.&#xD;
The KSQ contains 29-item covering five modules: general HRQoL (10- items), medications (3-items), lung (6-items), skin (3-items) and eyes (7- items). The KSQ is scored a re-ordered response scale ranging from 1 (&quot;all of the time&quot; or &quot;a huge amount&quot;) to 7 (&quot;none of the time&quot; or &quot;none at all&quot;).&#xD;
The formatted version of the SAT contains 51-items covering components for physical functioning, satisfaction with roles and activities, fatigue, pain interference, sleep disturbance, sarcoidosis-lung concerns, sarcoidosis-skin concerns, and sarcoidosis-skin stigma. The responses ranging from 1 to 5 with different response options (&quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;; &quot;unable to do&quot; to &quot;without any difficulty&quot;; or &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess fatigue in CS patients using a sarcoidosis-specific fatigue measure: the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FAS is a one-dimensional fatigue questionnaire reflecting on physical (5-items) and mental fatigue (5-items). Each item has a five-point rating scare, ranging from &quot;1-never&quot; to &quot;5-always&quot;. The score of FAS ranges from 10-50, with a well-defined cut-off for fatigue of &gt;21 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess anxiety and depression in CS patients using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is 14-item scale on a 4- point Likert scale (0-3) containing two subscales for anxiety and depression (7 items each subscale). The total score for each subscale is the sum of the respective items (ranging from 0-21).</description>
