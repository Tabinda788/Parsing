  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past ten years, the Cardiovascular Research Laboratory at Spaulding has refined a&#xD;
      unique form of exercise for those with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Functional Electrical&#xD;
      Stimulation Row Training (FESRT) couples volitional arm and electrically controlled leg&#xD;
      exercise, resulting in the benefits of large muscle mass exercise. Despite the success of the&#xD;
      FES-rowing Program at Spaulding, FES-rowing systems have not yet evolved beyond research&#xD;
      prototypes, and ours is the only program in the US where FES-rowing is available. A new&#xD;
      design is critically needed to enable people with paralysis to participate in FES rowing in&#xD;
      their own homes, which we believe will maximize both the health and commercial impacts of&#xD;
      FES-rowing.&#xD;

      The purpose of this observational study is to gain insights into user needs, and market&#xD;
      perception of physical activity and FES-rowing to further develop a new, home-based&#xD;
      FES-rowing system that meets the needs of people with paralysis. We will enroll a total of 20&#xD;
      subjects, male and female, 18 years and older with lower-limb paralysis who use a wheelchair&#xD;
      as their primary means of mobility. Ten subjects will be current FES-rowing participants&#xD;
      (especially those doing FES-rowing at home) and 10 subjects will be non-participants. To&#xD;
      determine user needs we will survey prospective customers to discover their motivations,&#xD;
      preferences and challenges pertaining to participation in physical activity in general and&#xD;
      FES-rowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers to Physical Activity Questionnaire for People with Mobility Impairments (BPAQ-MI):&#xD;
      measures barriers to physical activity across the intrapersonal, interpersonal,&#xD;
      organizational, and community domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS): measures physical activity for people with&#xD;
      chronic neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Mobility Questionnaire: Important information to inform on user and design&#xD;
      needs and potential market for at home FES-row system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0)-(FES-row&#xD;
      participants only): measures satisfaction with current FES-row system used in the ExPD&#xD;
      Program.&#xD;
