      Study BTX-1188-001 is a multicenter, open label, nonrandomized, sequential dose escalation&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety, toxicity, PK, and preliminary efficacy of BTX-1188. Dose&#xD;
      escalation will be conducted in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and advanced&#xD;
      lymphoid and solid tumors. Based on the results of the dose escalation, a recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      dose will be determined.&#xD;
