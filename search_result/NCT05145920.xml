  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and preliminary impacts of a new parenting program&#xD;
      consisting of a series of educational videos, delivered via a popular texting platform. For&#xD;
      this pilot project, the program content is focused on teaching parents strategies to better&#xD;
      manage one of the commonly reported challenges that children face, a transition to a&#xD;
      non-preferred activity. Parents with young children demonstrating behavior consistent with&#xD;
      ADHD and experiencing difficulties with daily transition routines are invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study employs a pre-post, open trial design with the primary aim to investigate&#xD;
      the feasibility of delivering parenting educational materials in a highly accessible format,&#xD;
      i.e., a widely used texting platform. The training videos demonstrate the applications of&#xD;
      antecedent- and reinforcement-based behavior management techniques in a specific situation&#xD;
      and encourage parents to build positive parenting habits. The program usability and&#xD;
      satisfaction will be assessed through ratings and answers to open-ended questions by&#xD;
      participating parents. The study targets parents of children demonstrating symptoms of ADHD.&#xD;
      These families frequently experience difficulties managing everyday routines at home, yet the&#xD;
      access to psychosocial treatment is limited. The investigators expect parents to engage well&#xD;
      in the program delivered via digital media. Based on the existing literature on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of behavior parent training delivered in traditional in-person format, a&#xD;
      moderate effect size is expected in the pre-post measures of parenting practices and the&#xD;
      child target behavior for this study.&#xD;
