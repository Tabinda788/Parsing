    <textblock>
      Background: Post-circumcision penile ischaemia is a rare but destructive complication. Our&#xD;
      goal is to present our experience in the management of children, who had different forms of&#xD;
      penile ischaemia, complicating the routine ritual male circumcision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: All male children who had post-circumcision penile ischaemia between&#xD;
      April 2017 and October 2020 were included in the study. A special designed protocol for&#xD;
      management of all cases includes a combination of early Pentoxifylline intervenes infusion&#xD;
      with Hyperbaric Oxygen inhalation, early catheterization, and appropriate surgical&#xD;
      debridement. Data were analyzed inclusively to patient age, the anesthesia method used,&#xD;
      Monopolar diathermy usage, early presentation, method of circumcision and positive wound&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;

      It is a cohort prospective study. All male children who had penile ischaemia after&#xD;
      circumcision were included in the study between April 2017 and October 2020. A special&#xD;
      designed protocol includes early admission of a child in Paediatric intensive care unit&#xD;
      (PICU). Catheterization by suitable size silicon Foley's catheter appropriate for the age. IV&#xD;
      Pentoxifylline in a dose of 10 mg/kg/day divided into 3 equal doses with good monitoring of&#xD;
      its side effects mainly tachycardia and convulsions. IV 3rd generation cephalosporin with&#xD;
      suitable doses according to the age and body weight. Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy is a specially&#xD;
      designed cabinet for infants and neonates with a barometric pressure equal to 760 mmHg for 20&#xD;
      minutes daily, then gradually increase up to one hour daily for 5 days per week (fig. 1). The&#xD;
      chamber was kept warm. The babies were fed before entering the chamber and if signs of hunger&#xD;
      appear during therapy. The baby was continuously monitored with pulse oximeter. Older&#xD;
      children are managed in the conventional Hyperbaric Oxygen chamber with the same regimen.&#xD;
      Proper surgical debridement together with daily topic dressing with nitroglycerin ointment&#xD;
      (2%). The treatment continued through the admission period. Follow up period range from 6&#xD;
      months up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed inclusively to patient age, the type of medical provider who performed the&#xD;
      circumcision, the technique of male circumcision, the anesthesia method used, if any&#xD;
      Monopolar diathermy usage, wound suturing after MC, the duration of between male circumcision&#xD;
      and presentation to our protocol, and the final condition of the patient at discharge and&#xD;
      after 6 months.&#xD;
