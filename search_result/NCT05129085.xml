  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbosacral radicular pain is present in around 40% of cases of low back pain. It is usually&#xD;
      caused by irritation and inflammation of the nerve root, and patients typically experience&#xD;
      pain radiating from the back to the lower limb in the distribution of the affected spinal&#xD;
      nerves. Epidural steroid injection is the most commonly used pain-relieving procedure in the&#xD;
      world. However, the analgesic efficacy of epidural steroid injection appears to be modest and&#xD;
      duration limited. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is an emerging treatment option for chronic&#xD;
      pain. It is currently used for treating musculoskeletal pain conditions such as&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and tendinopathies. While epidural steroids reduce pain by reducing&#xD;
      inflammation, PRP promotes the healing of nerve injury and reduces neuropathic pain. However,&#xD;
      the effect of transforaminal epidural PRP versus epidural steroid specifically for&#xD;
      lumbosacral radicular pain is unclear. In this study, a double blind, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will be performed to compare the effect of transforaminal epidural PRP versus epidural&#xD;
      steroid for pain relief in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain.&#xD;

      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of PRP The handling of and preparation of PRP will be performed under sterile&#xD;
      conditions in the operating theatre of Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China. The SmartPReP&#xD;
      Platelet Concentrate System (Harvest Terumo BCT) will be used and delivers a concentration of&#xD;
      platelets and growth factors that is roughly 4-6 times greater than that found in whole&#xD;
      blood. The separation process produces a white blood cell (WBC) composition that contains&#xD;
      100% more mononuclear (lymphocytes and monocytes) cells while reducing the granulocyte cells&#xD;
      by 60%. Two millilitres of anticoagulant citrate solution will be first added into the&#xD;
      smaller chamber of a two-chamber APC (Autologous Platelet Concentrate, Harvest Terumo BCT)&#xD;
      kit. Fifty-four milli-litres of autologous venous blood will be drawn under aseptic technique&#xD;
      from the cephalic or basilic vein of each patient's upper limb and collected in a sterile 60&#xD;
      cc syringe that contains 6 ml of anticoagulant citrate solution. The total volume of 60ml&#xD;
      consisting of blood sample and citrate solution will be transferred to the larger chamber&#xD;
      (blood chamber) of the APC kit. The APC kit will be loaded in the SmartPRep2 centrifuge&#xD;
      machine. Centrifuge spinning procedures will be followed by standard two-stage centrifugation&#xD;
      spinning. The first cycle will take three minutes at 2500 ± 150 rpm and the second cycle will&#xD;
      take nine minutes at 2300 ±140 rpm. After processing, the syringe with the spacer will be&#xD;
      used to withdraw and discard the platelet poor plasma layer. Seven milli-litres of PRP will&#xD;
      finally collected for injections. For patients in the ESI group, the blood will be discarded.&#xD;
      These will be done after the patient is placed in the prone position to maintain patient&#xD;
      blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural injection All epidural injections will be performed under aseptic techniques using&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance. A specialist pain fellow accredited by the Hong Kong College of&#xD;
      Anaesthesiologists will either conduct or supervise the performance of epidural steroid or&#xD;
      PRP injection. Epidural injection will be performed under aseptic technique in the operating&#xD;
      theatre. Standard monitoring will be applied and patients will receive light sedation using&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol with an effect site concentration of titrated&#xD;
      between 0.5-1.5mcg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lumbosacral level selected for injection will be based on symptoms and imaging findings.&#xD;
      The image intensifier will be adjusted to obtain an oblique view. A single level, unilateral&#xD;
      epidural injection will be performed. For the transforaminal epidural injection, a 22-gauge&#xD;
      spinal needle will be inserted coaxially via a subpedicular approach to target the upper part&#xD;
      of the foramen under fluoroscopic guidance. Correct needle position will be confirmed with&#xD;
      appropriate contrast spread (1ml of contrast) in the anteroposterior, oblique, and lateral&#xD;
      view. Spread of contrast delineating the nerve root together with proximal epidural spread&#xD;
      will be accepted as indicating correct needle position. A single level injection will be&#xD;
      performed because there are no clinical trials showing that multilevel injections is superior&#xD;
      to single level injection, and a well-positioned injection usually spreads to multiple&#xD;
      levels, thus achieving the effect of multi-level injection. 2ml of 1% lignocaine will be&#xD;
      given for skin infiltration. Once correct position is confirmed, drug injectate will be&#xD;
      administered. For the ESI group, 8mg of dexamethasone (4mg/ml) added to 1 ml of normal saline&#xD;
      will be given (total 3ml volume). For the EPRP group, 3 ml of PRP will be injected. The total&#xD;
      volume of injectate for both groups of patients is 3ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding will be assessed immediately after epidural injection using the James blinding index&#xD;
      and Bing blinding index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-interventions Patients from both groups will be instructed to stop taking non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids starting (2 weeks before and 6 weeks post&#xD;
      procedure), and any other drugs that may affect platelet function starting from 2 weeks&#xD;
      before epidural injection. Apart from these medications, all patients will continue with&#xD;
      their current analgesic drug therapy. Tramadol 50mg orally every 6 hours as required can be&#xD;
      prescribed as rescue medication. For patients taking opioids (including tramadol), these can&#xD;
      be increased by up to 20% above baseline. Patients will be instructed on how to titrate their&#xD;
      analgesic medication based on response during their follow up by the pain physician. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a standardized physiotherapy program after epidural injection (2&#xD;
      sessions). Patients in the study are not allowed to receive other co-interventions such as&#xD;
      other interventional pain procedures or acupuncture. But they can exit the study at any time&#xD;
      point during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow up and outcome assessment Outcome data will be collected by an&#xD;
      investigator who will be blinded to patient allocation. Baseline data for these outcomes will&#xD;
      be collected prior to epidural injection. Outcome assessment will be performed during patient&#xD;
      follow up on postoperative day (POD) 1, and also at 1, 3, and 6 months after epidural&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the following pain outcomes will be collected: average NRS pain score over the leg&#xD;
      (average pain score over the past week), average NRS pain score over the back, worse pain&#xD;
      score over the leg (over the past week), worse pain score over the back, and the presence of&#xD;
      50% or more reduction in leg pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcomes that will be assessed include health-related quality of life, functional&#xD;
      status, patient global impression of change scale (PGIC), analgesic consumption, and&#xD;
      psychological status. The Oswestry disability index (ODI) will be used to assess function.&#xD;
      This a 10-question survey used to assess function for individuals with low back and/or leg&#xD;
      pain. Health related quality of life will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Short&#xD;
      Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36). EQ5D will be also be used to measure health status and to&#xD;
      enable cost-effectiveness analysis. Psychological status will be evaluated using the Beck&#xD;
      Depression Scale. Complications and adverse effects related to the procedure will be assessed&#xD;
      using both closed ended and open-ended questions on the same day after the procedure, on POD&#xD;
      1, and at 1, 3 and 6 months after injection. These will be assessed by a blinded&#xD;
      investigator. A reduction in analgesic medication will be defined as cessation of non-opioid&#xD;
      analgesic medication or a 20% reduction in opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have a positive response to the epidural injection will continue to be blinded&#xD;
      and assessed at the next follow-up. A positive response to epidural steroid or PRP injection&#xD;
      is defined as a 50% or more reduction in average leg pain and positive global perceived&#xD;
      effect. Positive global perceived effect is defined as a positive response to the question&#xD;
      'my pain has improved/worsened/stayed the same since my last visit' and 'I am satisfied/not&#xD;
      satisfied with the treatment I received and would recommend it to others. Patients will not&#xD;
      be permitted to receive other interventional pain procedures while they are in the study.&#xD;
      Patients can choose to exit the study at any time to pursue other interventions (eg surgery,&#xD;
      interventional pain procedures) if they feel inadequate benefit with the allocated treatment.&#xD;
      Unblinding will be done for patients who exit the study and they will not be followed up.&#xD;
      Intention to treat analysis will be performed. Missing data points for pain scores and other&#xD;
      outcomes will be imputed using the 'last observation carried forward' method, which is also&#xD;
      similar to other studies evaluating epidural injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data collection The following data will also be collected during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathological diagnosis (eg herniated disc, spinal stenosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any precipitating event for lumbosacral radicular pain (none, road traffic accident,&#xD;
           fall, lifting heavy object, other)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of epidural injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of lumbosacral radicular pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesic medication (including opioids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events and complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other pain comorbidities&#xD;
