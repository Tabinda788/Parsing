    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blind, controlled clinical trial of live attenuated varicella vaccines&#xD;
      manufactured by Shanghai Institute of Biological Products Co.,Ltd. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a two doses vaccination of investigational&#xD;
      vaccine with 0,28 day and 0,56 day immunization schedule in population aged ≥13 years old.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, blind, controlled phase III clinical trial in population aged ≥13&#xD;
      years old. The experimental vaccine will be manufactured by Shanghai Institute of Biological&#xD;
      Products Co.,Ltd.. A total of 2480 subjects aged 13 years and older will be enrolled with&#xD;
      1240 subjects in 13~17 years old group and1240 subjects in 18 years and older group. 1240&#xD;
      subjects in each age group would be randomly divided into experimental group and control&#xD;
      group according to 1:1 ratio, and subjects will receive two doses of vaccine with the&#xD;
      immunization course of 0,28 days or 0,56 days. In addition, 400 subjects from experimental&#xD;
      group (100 subjects per subgroup) would be selected to collect blood at 3 and 5 years after&#xD;
      immunization to evaluate immune persistence of live attenuated varicella vaccines.&#xD;
