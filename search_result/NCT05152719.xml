  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lifestyle modifications, such as manipulating diet and exercise, have been shown to&#xD;
      enhance cognitive function. This study aims to determine if a combination of Sprint Interval&#xD;
      Training (SIT) and Time Restricted Eating (TRE) elicits greater enhancements in cognitive&#xD;
      function than either of these interventions alone. SIT and TRE have both been proven to have&#xD;
      high adherence rates and require minimal lifestyle changes, therefore the implementation of&#xD;
      these may allow for a feasible method of improving cognition in healthy populations. A group&#xD;
      of young adults will be randomized into either a SIT group, TRE group, or a SIT+TRE group. To&#xD;
      assess the changes in cognitive function, cognitive tests will be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      biweekly. Secondly, we will be monitoring the differences in the three groups in terms of&#xD;
      body composition, which will be measured using a BodPod. It is hypothesized that the SIT+TRE&#xD;
      group will display the greatest improvements in cognitive function and body composition&#xD;
      versus the TRE only group and the SIT only group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will explore how a combination of a time restricted eating (TRE) strategy and a&#xD;
      sprint interval training (SIT) exercise program will affect cognitive function. Both TRE and&#xD;
      SIT have been shown to present significant brain challenges, and are both easily implemented&#xD;
      lifestyle habits. Participants will be randomized into 3 groups of either SIT alone, TRE&#xD;
      alone, or SIT + TRE. We will be assessing acute effects (single day of TRE, followed by a&#xD;
      single session of SIT the next day), and the effects over a 6 week period. The SIT protocol&#xD;
      consists of four 30 second sprinting bouts, separated by 2 minutes of recovery. An additional&#xD;
      sprint bout will be added biweekly to maintain progressive overload. SIT will be performed 3&#xD;
      times a week for the treatment group. The TRE involves no restrictions on the type or amount&#xD;
      of food consumed, however, food must be consumed between 12pm and 8pm. The SIT will occur in&#xD;
      an unfed state towards the end of the fast. The study will involve sedentary young adults. To&#xD;
      evaluate the success of the intervention, 2 cognitive tests (Stroop and Corsi block) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and biweekly over a 6 week treatment period. Additionally, body&#xD;
      composition testing will occur at baseline and once every three weeks using a BodPod. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the combination treatment group will have greater improvements in their&#xD;
      cognitive function and body composition compared to either intervention alone.&#xD;

It will involve 120 participants randomly assigned to one of three groups with either sprint interval training, time restricted eating, or both.

    <description>Participants in the SIT group will start with a 5 minute warm-up jogging at around 70-80% of their heart rate max. The SIT protocol consists of 30 second intervals of &quot;all out&quot; shuttle runs, seperated by 2 minutes of low pace walking active rest. This will be repeated between 4 times during the first 2 weeks, 5 times during the second 2 weeks, and 6 times during the third 2 weeks. Participants will be instructed to sprint the greatest possible distance in 30 seconds, starting by running to the 5m marker and back, then to the 10m marker and back, then to the 15m marker etc. The SIT session will finish with 2 minutes walking at a pace 50% of their heart rate max.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to limit their food intake to the hours between 12pm to 8pm, and fast outside of these hours. During the fast, participants may consume zero calorie beverages with no caffeine or artificial sweetener. Participants are instructed to maintain their diet, with no restrictions on the type or amount of food consumed in the feeding window.</description>
