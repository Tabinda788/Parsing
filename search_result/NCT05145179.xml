  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two parts: a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and a dose expansion&#xD;
      part (Part 2). In both study parts, SSGJ-705 will be administered，the administration duration&#xD;
      may be adjusted based on outcomes of previous patients if necessary) followed by safety, PK,&#xD;
      PD, potential anti tumor effects and immunogenicity evaluation.&#xD;
