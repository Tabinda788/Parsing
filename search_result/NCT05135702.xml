  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide&#xD;
      despite improved mitigation of traditional risk factors. Large association studies have&#xD;
      linked the gut microbiome alterations with inflammation, CAD, and traditional CAD risk&#xD;
      factors. Subsequent studies have shown concomitant improvements in gut dysbiosis,&#xD;
      inflammation, and cardiometabolic diseases using probiotics and other gut-modulating&#xD;
      therapies. To date, many studies have shown a correlative relationship between intestinal&#xD;
      bacteria composition and the presence of CAD, or severity of heart attacks, but few have&#xD;
      begun to elucidate potential metabolic and immunologic mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our lab recently supplemented Lactobacillus plantarum 299v in men with stable CAD, which&#xD;
      improved systemic inflammation and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (BA-FMD) - a&#xD;
      measure of endothelial function and a predictive CAD precursor. Improvement in BA-FMD&#xD;
      positively correlated with increased serum propionic acid (PA) concentrations. PA is a gut&#xD;
      microbiome-derived short chain fatty acid (SCFA) with known human vascular receptors and&#xD;
      implicated in endothelial function, innate immunity, and glucose homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether PA is mediating improvement in endothelial dysfunction or inflammation in our prior&#xD;
      experiment remains unknown. The investigator's objective is to determine whether endothelial&#xD;
      cell function is improved by dietary supplementation of sodium propionate in patients with&#xD;
      established coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the investigators wish to elucidate to what&#xD;
      extent inflammation is reduced by this therapy, by both measuring serum inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and by seeing if plasma from treated patients induces anti-inflammatory transcriptomic&#xD;
      responses from cultured endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, both of&#xD;
      which are involved in atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 will determine the impact of dietary PA supplementation on endothelial&#xD;
      function and traditional CAD risk factors in patients with CAD. We will utilize ultrasound to&#xD;
      assess the percent change in BA-FMD before and after dietary PA supplementation. The extent&#xD;
      of endothelium-dependency of these responses will be tested by measuring BA-FMD following&#xD;
      nitroglycerin administration. We will also measure markers representative of traditional CAD&#xD;
      risk factors, such as lipid levels and HgbA1C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 will determine anti-inflammatory changes in vivo and in transcriptomic&#xD;
      signatures of cultured EC and PBMCs induced by dietary PA. We will measure changes to&#xD;
      systemic serum inflammatory markers involved in atherosclerotic processes using a targeted&#xD;
      metabolomics approach, using plasma from our cohort before and after PA supplementation.&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be used to incubate aforementioned cells to compare transcriptomic&#xD;
      signatures of cells subjected to pre-supplementation plasma versus post-supplementation&#xD;
      plasma. We will use Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to determine changes to inflammatory pathways&#xD;
      and i.i.com to determine whether more anti-inflammatory signatures were induced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 will determine the impact of PA supplementation on gut microbiome taxonomy and&#xD;
      diversity. As an optional additional clinical study activity, we will collect stool samples&#xD;
      before and after dietary PA supplementation, subject samples to multiplex 16S RNA sequencing,&#xD;
      and calculate the Shannon Diversity Index. This will help us determine changes in individual&#xD;
      gut microbiome constituents and diversity of the entire population.&#xD;

      Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a pathological state of vessel function characterized by&#xD;
      increased expression of pro-vasoconstrictive mediators and increased thrombotic risk. ED is&#xD;
      associated with development of atherosclerosis, including coronary artery disease (CAD), and&#xD;
      with increased risk of cardiovascular event Therefore, there is an ongoing research effort to&#xD;
      restore endothelial function in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      associated with endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiome has been well correlated with the presence of CAD and alterations to the&#xD;
      gut microbiome have been mechanistically linked to the severity of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      Animal experiments showed that alteration of gut bacteria with supplementation of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) and vancomycin is associated with reduced leptin&#xD;
      levels, size of myocardial infarction and improved post -ischemic cardiac function. In&#xD;
      humans, dietary supplementation with Lp299v was associated with significant reductions in&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol, fibrinogen, and leptin concentrations in smokers. Our lab recently showed in&#xD;
      men with stable CAD that six weeks' supplementation with Lp299v improved endothelial function&#xD;
      as assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (BA-FMD), a widely accepted noninvasive&#xD;
      modality of assessing vascular endothelial function. This intervention concurrently reduced&#xD;
      serum inflammatory markers IL-8, IL-12 and leptin, and post-probiotic plasma drove an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory transcriptomic response in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;
      Interestingly, these beneficial changes were not accompanied by changes in gut microbiome&#xD;
      constituents. Instead, the increase seen in BA-FMD was positively correlated with an increase&#xD;
      in serum propionic acid, one of the short-chain fatty acids, a set of molecules produced by&#xD;
      gut microbes and freely absorbed into human circulation. Propionic acid is known to improve&#xD;
      endothelial function, reduce systemic inflammation, and improve glucose homeostasis in&#xD;
      several models. These experiments suggested that Lp299v's beneficial effects were mediated by&#xD;
      changes to the existing gut microbiome's metabolism as opposed to changes to microbial&#xD;
      constituents. We identified propionic acid as a potential mediator of these beneficial&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study our objective is to assess if there is any impact of sodium propionate dietary&#xD;
      supplementation on vascular endothelial function and on the levels of circulating&#xD;
      inflammatory markers related to endothelial dysfunction. In addition, we also want to study&#xD;
      if the impact on endothelial function is associated with either: anti-inflammatory changes in&#xD;
      relevant vascular cell types (e.g. endothelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells), or&#xD;
      on the constituents of the gut microbiome itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial function is easily measurable by non-invasive means. Endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      measured non-invasively independently predicts future cardiovascular risk in patients both&#xD;
      with and without clinically apparent cardiovascular disease. Conduit vessel endothelial&#xD;
      function in humans is commonly quantified by measurement of BA-FMD, which represents the&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent relaxation of a conduit artery-typically the brachial artery - due to&#xD;
      an increased blood flow. BA-FMD correlates with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in&#xD;
      the coronary arteries and is a commonly recognized &quot;barometer&quot; of cardiovascular risk. BA-FMD&#xD;
      is an ideal surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk to monitor the acute impact of Lp299v&#xD;
      supplementation on vascular endothelial function.&#xD;
