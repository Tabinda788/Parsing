  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related cognitive impairment is a wide phenomenon. Mild cognitive impairment is a&#xD;
      transitional stage between Dementia and normal cognition.Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a&#xD;
      syndrome that has been recognized in older adults and it has become a topic of a major focus&#xD;
      on clinical care and research. In people with this condition, there are cognitive deficits&#xD;
      and these have adverse effects on activities of daily living . These patients cannot&#xD;
      recognize their impairment. Mild cognitive impairment is a risk factor for dementia.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical features of MCI are memory impairment along with language or speech impairments,&#xD;
      executive functions, and visuospatial impairments. In regard to clinical features of Mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI), there are motor problems as patients have difficulty in doing&#xD;
      complex motor tasks like doing pegboard assembly and also in fine and gross motor skills&#xD;
      performance like they have difficulty in maintaining balance and body weight. Major factors&#xD;
      contributing to mild cognitive impairment or major causes are medical conditions like hepatic&#xD;
      or renal failure, depression, sleep disturbances, psychological problems,s and medicine side&#xD;
      effects. impaired attention and concentration can lead to impaired memory and a decline in&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As literature supports the evidence of the effectiveness of Exergaming in adults with&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders.As Exer-gaming training program improved their lower extremity&#xD;
      functioning, cognitive function, and reduced depression, neuropsychiatric symptoms too.&#xD;
      Recent studies on the treatment of Exergaming and its effect on the quality of life in&#xD;
      dementia approach the standing balance Exer-gaming being effective and has increased&#xD;
      attention, concentration, memory, and reaction time and has improved physical, cognitive,&#xD;
      emotional, social function and quality of life and decreased the level of frailty in dementia&#xD;
      patients. Recent literature on Exergaming has successfully improved cognition, balance,gait,&#xD;
      and verbal memory in MCI patients and reduced fall risk in older adults of age &gt;55 years&#xD;

    <time_frame>week 8</time_frame>
    <description>This tool tells human behavior and coping outcomes. It's very useful with studying behaviour of people who are living with any illness. This scale have 10-items and possible responses are &quot;not at all ,all true&quot;1=hardly true, 2=moderately true,3= exactly true,4=total score between 10 and 40</description>

    <measure>2 Minute Walk test (2MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 8</time_frame>
    <description>is a reliable and valid tool for accessing balance in older adults. Instructions given to the participants are that you have to &quot;walk at your comfortable zone. The assessor will be half a meter behind the participant to ensure his/her safety. No encouragement or feedback is given during the whole test. Two practice trials and one final trial for record are performed. The participants are given at least 10 min rest between trials. The distance covered in the 2 min is recorded as the 2MWT</description>
