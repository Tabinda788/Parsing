  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black adults are 30% more likely to die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to White&#xD;
      adults, and more than half of this racial disparity in cardiovascular mortality may be&#xD;
      attributed to the substantially greater prevalence of high blood pressure and vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction in Black adults. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent signaling molecule and key regular&#xD;
      of vascular function that is suspected to be reduced in black individuals, but can be&#xD;
      enriched by dietary nitrate (e.g., arugula, spinach, beets). The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that increasing NO bioavailability via nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BRJ)&#xD;
      will lower blood pressure and improve vascular health in Black adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators long-term research goal is to investigate mechanisms accounting for the&#xD;
      higher prevalence of CVD and high blood pressure in Black individuals, and identify effective&#xD;
      preventive strategies. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule that plays an essential role&#xD;
      in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure regulation. Some, but not all, studies&#xD;
      have observed reduced NO bioavailability in Black individuals, which may contribute to racial&#xD;
      disparities in vascular health. Dietary nitrate supplementation using beetroot juice (BRJ) is&#xD;
      demonstrated to increase circulating NO, lower blood pressure and arterial stiffness, and&#xD;
      improve blood pressure regulation in clinical populations and health individuals. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that increasing NO bioavailability by nitrate-rich BRJ supplementation will&#xD;
      lower blood pressure and improve vascular health in Black adults. The investigators&#xD;
      acknowledge that racial differences are not entirely driven by ancestry, and thus will assess&#xD;
      and account for sociocultural factors and health behaviors (i.e., sleep, physical activity,&#xD;
      and nutrition) that may contribute to racial health disparities.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will use the SphygmoCor XCEL system to assess pulse wave velocity (PWV). A high-fidelity strain-gauge transducer is used to obtain the pressure waveform at the carotid pulse. Distances from the carotid artery sampling site to the femoral artery (upper leg instrumented with a thigh cuff for oscillometric sphygmomanometry), and from the carotid artery to the suprasternal notch will be recorded. PWV will be expressed as m/s.</description>
