  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers doing this study think that performing scans of the brain and testing&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in people with HER2-positive breast cancer may be an effective way&#xD;
      of identifying the early onset of CNS metastases (such as brain cancer). If the researchers&#xD;
      can identify the early onset of CNS metastases, they can immediately treat that cancer and&#xD;
      possibly prevent it from worsening. Currently, people with breast cancer don't usually have&#xD;
      scans of the brain or CSF testing unless they are experiencing symptoms of CNS metastases.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This represents a two-cohort feasibility study to establish the feasibility of a multi-modality central nervous system (CNS) disease detection platform in patients with HER2+ breast cancer with no known CNS metastatic disease. Patients will enroll into one of 2 cohorts. Cohort A will be open to patients with Stage IV HER2+ breast cancer and Cohort B will include patients with Stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Once enrolled on study, patients will undergo screening MRI Brain (unless already done as standard of care within 2 months on enrollment to evaluate for CNS disease) as well as lumbar puncture to evaluate for CNS disease. Once on study, patients will undergo LP and MRI Brain at 2 timepoints 6 months apart (+/- 8 weeks). LP will be performed to analyze cerebrospinal fluid for: cytology, circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA. 6-month intervals for investigations have been based on feedback from patient advocates as well as clinical determination.</description>
