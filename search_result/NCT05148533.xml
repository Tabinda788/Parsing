    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I/II study of single drug TJ011133 and Toripalimab combine treatment&#xD;
      forAdvanced solid tumor. This study include two stages. First stage is dose escalation and&#xD;
      second stage is dose extension. The purpose of part A is to comfirm the MTD or MED and the&#xD;
      clinical dose. The purpose of part B is to observe the safty, effectiveness, PK, PD and&#xD;
      biomarker properties for effective subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center phase I/II clinical trial which will enroll 96 to 102&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two phases, the first of which is the dose escalation study of&#xD;
      TJ011133 in combination with toripalimab, and the second stage is a dose expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 1, approximately 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled in each group to receive TJ011133&#xD;
      (30 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg, QW) in combination with toripalimab injection (240 mg, Q3W). A safety&#xD;
      assessment committee, consisting of the sponsor and the investigator, will assess the safety&#xD;
      of the first 3 subjects at day 21 after the first dose to determine the safety of the doses&#xD;
      as well as to determine whether to enroll 3 additional patients to continue to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose expansion phase, patients with melanoma, gastric cancer, and head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma will be enrolled, with 30 patients for each malignancy, with a total&#xD;
      of 90 patients. TJ011133 will be administered at a prespecified dose of 30 mg/kg or 45 mg/kg,&#xD;
      QW or at a less frequency of Q2W or Q3W, and the dosing regimen will be determined based on&#xD;
      the safety data obtained by PK/PD model analysis from other TJ011133 clinical studies. And&#xD;
      TJ011133 will be given in combination with toripalimab injection at 240 mg, Q3W, until the&#xD;
      occurrence of endpoint events such as intolerance or progressive disease.&#xD;
