    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to compare analytic, functional and mixed&#xD;
      (analytic/functional) methods in strengthening rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers muscles.&#xD;
      For that purpose, participants had to follow a strengthening program 3 times a week during 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Each participant was allocated to a group (analytic, functional and mixed groups) in a random&#xD;
      way while assuring that the groups were quite similar in morphological data or in&#xD;
      performance. The strengthening program has to be performed three times a week during eight&#xD;
      weeks by each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercises included in the program were chosen among the bests exercises described in&#xD;
      literature to active shoulder rotators as well as scapular stabilizing muscles. The analytic&#xD;
      group has to perform the following exercises: prone rowing with dumbbell, prone external&#xD;
      rotation at 90° of abduction, prone extension, bilateral scapular protraction with dumbbells,&#xD;
      eccentric internal rotation at 90° of abduction, external rotation diagonal exercise and&#xD;
      single arm shot put medicine ball throw. The functional group performed the same exercises&#xD;
      but with a functional component: standard plank rowing, swissball external rotation at 90° of&#xD;
      abduction, standard plank extension, bilateral scapular protraction (standard plank + raised&#xD;
      feet), eccentric internal rotation 90° of abduction with unipodal glute bridge, external&#xD;
      rotation diagonal in an unipodal position and single arm shot put throw with medicine ball in&#xD;
      and single arm shot put medicine ball throw. Then, for the mixed group, the program included&#xD;
      exercises from the analytic group and other ones from the functional group in equal parts.&#xD;
      For all the groups, the exercises aimed to strengthen shoulder rotators were performed five&#xD;
      times in a row and the others aimed to strengthen scapular stabilizing muscles were performed&#xD;
      fifteen times in a row. The only exception was for the single arm shot put medicine ball&#xD;
      throw that was performed ten times. Two series of each exercises were performed during each&#xD;
      session, which represent a mean duration of thirty minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning and at the end of the intervention, three different evaluations were&#xD;
      performed :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of shoulder rotators strength (with an isokinetic device)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of scapular stabilizers strength (with an isokinetic device)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of functional performance (with Medicine Ball Throw, CKCUEST, Y Balance Test&#xD;
           and a core stability test)&#xD;
