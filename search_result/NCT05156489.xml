  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibulodynia (VBD), term revised by Consensus Terminology and Classification of Persistent&#xD;
      Vulvar Pain and Vulvodynia in 2015, is a vulvar pain of at least 3 months' duration, without&#xD;
      clear identifiable cause and localized at vestibuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women affected by this disease report localized hypersensitivity and pain of the vulvar&#xD;
      vestibule to the touch (eg, during sexual intercourse or tampon use). This pattern of&#xD;
      responses is suggestive of sensory abnormalities in the form of evoked pain (eg, hyperalgesia&#xD;
      or allodynia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research biopsy studies have demonstrated increased innervation of the vulvar vestibule and&#xD;
      increased subepithelial heparinase activity and cytokines that have been associated with&#xD;
      neuroinflammatory processes. In addition, the discomfort inherent in VBD is always associated&#xD;
      with pelvic floor muscle overactivity, with the development of myofascial trigger points,&#xD;
      resulting in localized or radiating pain and/or severe tenderness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rich nerve plexus was identified within the vaginal submucosa, which was only composed of&#xD;
      sympathetic and parasympathetic axons, with contributions of smaller sensory fibers. The&#xD;
      sensory nerve endings of the vulvar vestibule are dense and shallow, making this region more&#xD;
      physiologically sensitive. Several works suggest that a thinner vestibular mucosa is more&#xD;
      sensitive to nociception because nerve endings become more superficial, thus altering the&#xD;
      transduction of mechanical pressure to facilitate nociception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CO2 fractionated laser, has been used to safely and effectively treat symptomatic vaginal&#xD;
      atrophy. This tool has also been found to be useful in the treatment of vestibulodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open pilot study, 30 female subjects aged more 18 years old at inclusion, having&#xD;
      symptoms of VBD from at least 6 months, have given her informed consent and meet all the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, will be enrolled. The subjects will be treated with CO2 Fractionated&#xD;
      Laser into vestibule, for 3 sessions at monthly intervals with a follow up of 4 months.&#xD;
      Subjects will come to a total of 6 visits over a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the performance and safety of Pixel&#xD;
      CO2-Alma Fractionated Laser in women affected by VBD by the assessment of vestibular mucosa&#xD;
      thickness by ultrasound evaluation and vestibular perception thresholds changes at day 84 and&#xD;
      120 and by searching the adverse event during all the study. The secondary objectives are the&#xD;
      assessment of VAS for burning/pain, and dyspareunia, evaluation of pain and hypersensitivity&#xD;
      to the touch by Swab test, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and by Vulval Pain Functional&#xD;
      Questionnaire (VQ) at the visits.&#xD;
