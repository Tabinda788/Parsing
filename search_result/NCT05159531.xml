  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM) account for over half of new HIV&#xD;
      infections in Canada each year, and have a 131-fold higher risk of HIV than other Canadian&#xD;
      men. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using regular oral tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC) is an&#xD;
      effective and safe HIV prevention option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite growing interest, awareness and willingness to use PrEP there has been numerous&#xD;
      challenges to the broader rollout of PrEP. This study will address some of these challenges&#xD;
      by assessing participant satisfaction,feasibility and clinical outcomes associated with a&#xD;
      web-based mobile health (mHealth) model of care for daily oral TAF/FTC PrEP compared to&#xD;
      standard of care delivery of TAF/FTC PrEP in Canadian GBM/TGW, in the era of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this study is to provide a scalable model for remote PrEP delivery that&#xD;
      minimizes the need for in-person interactions; respects guideline recommendations regarding&#xD;
      how to optimally monitor patients; and is attractive to both patients and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a 1:1 open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial using a AB:BA crossover&#xD;
      design, comparing the standard of care to an mHealth based model of care (Freddie® ) for&#xD;
      TAF/FTC PrEP delivery over 72 weeks.&#xD;
