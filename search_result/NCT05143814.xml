  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare workers PPE (personal protective equipment) when interacting with patients either&#xD;
      infected or, potentially carrying SARS-CoV-2. One of the major routes of transmission is via&#xD;
      droplet spread through oral and nasal mucosa therefore respiratory protective equipment (RPE)&#xD;
      is an important part of PPE. There are concerns in dentistry that droplet spread can be&#xD;
      increased during aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). This poses an increased risk to&#xD;
      dentists and allied professionals in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fit testing is needed to ensure a mask forms a facial seal around the mouth and nose. Using a&#xD;
      respirator mask without fit testing can reduce its effectiveness from between 6-88% with an&#xD;
      optimal facial seal being more critical than the filtering performance. Commercial respirator&#xD;
      masks are mass-produced for ' standard' faces, and often fail to provide a good fit for users&#xD;
      thereby compromising the intended respirator filtering capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high level of fit test failures, without the provision of improved fits of masks,&#xD;
      patient care will be highly curtailed for frontline staff at risk of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a&#xD;
      reusable bespoke 3D printed mask adapter used with a soft FFP3 disposable mask provides an&#xD;
      economical solution to address the passing of fit testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barts Health NHS Trust staff members who have previously failed the fit test to the first&#xD;
      line FFP3 disposable respirator will be invited to enrol in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barts/QMUL scan App will be used to capture the facial scan of the subjects using a research&#xD;
      allocated smartphone. Participants will be asked to be clean-shaven without any facial&#xD;
      jewellery which could hinder the scan data. The App automatically generates a customized 3D&#xD;
      print file (.stl) which will be sent for 3D printing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mask adapter will be fitted over the first-line FFP3 respirator once it is properly worn&#xD;
      and checked as per the procedure.&#xD;
