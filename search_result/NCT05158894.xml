  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common neurological disorder typically characterized by attacks of throbbing or&#xD;
      pulsating headache on one side of the head of moderate to severe pain intensity. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate fetal, maternal, and infant outcomes through 12 months of age&#xD;
      among women exposed to Ubrelvy during pregnancy, as well as in 2 Ubrelvy-unexposed comparison&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ubrelvy (ubrogepant) is an approved drug for the acute treatment of migraine in adults.&#xD;
      Approximately 560 pregnant women with migraine exposed to Ubrelvy and 560 pregnant women with&#xD;
      migraine without exposure to Ubrelvy will be enrolled in this study in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the Ubrelvy-exposed group will receive Ubrelvy as prescribed by&#xD;
      their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
