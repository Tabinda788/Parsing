  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty and sarcopenia are two age-related syndromes which can result in adverse&#xD;
      health-related events. The combination of both is more predictive of mortality than either&#xD;
      condition alone. These conditions can be reversed through an early detection and appropriate&#xD;
      interventions. Nevertheless, scientific community highlights the lack of cheap, portable,&#xD;
      rapid and easy-to-use tools for detecting frailty and sarcopenia in combination. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to validate an iPhone App to detect frailty and sarcopenia syndromes in&#xD;
      community dwelling older adults. This is a protocol study of a retrospective diagnostic test&#xD;
      accuracy study which will include at least 400 participants older than 60 years recruited&#xD;
      from elderly social centers of Murcia city. Researchers will recollect data of health status,&#xD;
      dependency, cognitive status, and functional capacity of the participants. The index test&#xD;
      will consist in the measurement of muscle power exerted during a single Sit-to-stand through&#xD;
      an App (iPhone), combined with calf and mid-upper arm circumference. The reference standard&#xD;
      will be frailty syndrome and sarcopenia assessed according to Fried's phenotype and to the&#xD;
      European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) (2019) recommendations,&#xD;
      respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive&#xD;
      values, and area under the curve will be reported.&#xD;

    <description>Muscular power generated by participants will be measured using an App (Sit-to-stand App version 1.1) installed on an iPhone (Apple Inc., USA).&#xD;
During the execution, subjects will sit on a rigid chair with their arms crossed over their chest with the hip, knee and ankle joints at approximately 90 degrees. Subjects will be asked to stand-up as fast as possible. Participants will complete three STS repetitions. No footwear will be allowed during the test.</description>

    <measure>Frailty Syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty Syndrome will be assessed according to Fried's Phenotype, which focuses on:&#xD;
Handgrip strength&#xD;
Usual gait speed&#xD;
Weight loss&#xD;
Exhaustion&#xD;
Physical activity levels&#xD;
Subjects who will result positive to three out of five criteria will be considered as &quot;frail&quot;, whereas if they will result positive to only one or two of them they will be considered as &quot;pre-frail&quot;. The absence of each criteria will be necessary to define a subject as &quot;robust&quot;.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sarcopenia</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sarcopenia will be assessed according to the recommendation provided by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) (2019). This guideline focuses on the assessment of:&#xD;
Leg muscle strength&#xD;
Muscle mass quantity&#xD;
Physical performance&#xD;
The presence of low muscle strength levels will be considered as &quot;probable sarcopenia&quot;; the presence of low muscle mass and strength levels will be considered as &quot;confirmed sarcopenia&quot;; finally, the presence of the three criteria will be considered as &quot;severe sarcopenia&quot;.</description>

chronic pathologies&#xD;
smoking habits&#xD;
polypharmacy&#xD;
depression&#xD;
number of falls&#xD;
