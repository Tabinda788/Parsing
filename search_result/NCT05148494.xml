  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus about the best bowel preparation prior to transanal endoscopic surgery&#xD;
      TES). Cleanliness and visibility in the rectosigmoid and rectum are of utmost importance,&#xD;
      possibly even more so than during colonoscopy, to facilitate safe, precise and efficient&#xD;
      resection of the rectal lesion and potentially adequate closure of the defect. Both Fleet&#xD;
      enemas and oral mechanical bowel preparation are considered standard of care in preparation&#xD;
      for TES. This single center two arm single blinded randomized controlled trial will compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of Fleet enemas in comparison to Pico Salax oral mechanical bowel&#xD;
      preparation in cleansing the rectum as measured by a modified version of the Ottawa Bowel&#xD;
      Prep Scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral mechanical bowel preparation with Pico Salax (picosulfate sodium, magnesium oxide, and&#xD;
      citric acid) or alternative is considered a standard modality for cleansing the entire colon&#xD;
      prior to colonoscopy or surgical procedures(1,2). Fleet enemas are sodium phosphate-based&#xD;
      laxatives in the form of a liquid inserted rectally, which are also very effective at&#xD;
      evacuating the solid stool from the sigmoid and rectum in preparation for procedures such as&#xD;
      flexible sigmoidoscopy or anoscopy, which only require visualization of the distal colon and&#xD;
      rectum(3,4,5). Commonly, endoscopists use the well validated bowel preparation scores such as&#xD;
      the Boston Bowel Prep Score(6,7), Aronchick Scale(8) or the Ottawa Bowel Prep&#xD;
      Scale(9,10,11,12) when evaluating the effectiveness of such bowel preparation regimens at&#xD;
      clearing away all debris and opaque liquid from the colon. Few studies have been performed to&#xD;
      evaluate whether an oral mechanical bowel preparation or a rectal application by means of&#xD;
      fleet enemas or alternatives gives better visibility or is preferred by the patient. Sharma&#xD;
      and colleagues published a randomized controlled trial comparing two fleet enemas with an&#xD;
      oral preparation that consisted of magnesium citrate and two Dulcolax tablets for flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy, and were able to show that patient acceptance, encounter time, technical ease,&#xD;
      quality of colon preparation was significantly better with the oral form of colon preparation&#xD;
      than with standard fleet enemas(13). On the other hand, Drew and colleagues were able to show&#xD;
      that fleet enemas were superior to picosulfate based oral bowel preparation for flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy in a randomized controlled trial also showing a decreased incidence of&#xD;
      associated adverse symptoms, and better patient tolerance(14). Conflicting studies exist.&#xD;
      Both bowel regimens are considered standard of care in preparation for surgery of the sigmoid&#xD;
      and rectum. Fleet enemas seem to be the preparation most commonly used for flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transanal endoscopic surgery (TES) is a minimally invasive technique used to perform full&#xD;
      thickness excisions of rectal lesions (benign and malignant) with precision, allowing access&#xD;
      to lesions in the rectum as high as 22 cm from the anus. The technique can be performed using&#xD;
      either the rigid transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) platform or the flexible port termed&#xD;
      transanal endoscopic minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS). The technique decreases risk of&#xD;
      positive margins and local recurrence in comparison to standard local excision techniques in&#xD;
      the operating room. It is the preferred method of local excision of rectal lesions. As with&#xD;
      polyp detection and removal during flexible sigmoidoscopy, TES for rectal neoplasms requires&#xD;
      excellent visibility and minimization of debris in order to be able to perform the precise&#xD;
      excision of the lesion and help facilitate closure of the full thickness defect in the rectal&#xD;
      wall. TES is performed globally with no consensus about the optimal bowel preparation regimen&#xD;
      for achieving visibility and facilitating the easiest, most efficient and safest dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether oral Pico Salax bowel preparation&#xD;
      regimen achieves a higher score on the Ottawa Bowel Prep Scale specifically for the&#xD;
      rectosigmoid segment in comparison to 2 fleet enemas during TES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives include validation of the Ottawa Bowel Prep Scale specifically for&#xD;
      use with fleet enemas or Pico Salax for the rectosigmoid segment during TES; determining if&#xD;
      there are differences in length of time spent cleaning the operative field by the surgeon;&#xD;
      the ability to close the defect; post-operative short-term complications, and patient&#xD;
      tolerability of the preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as a pilot study for a potentially larger multi-center pan Canadian&#xD;
      RCT. The TEMPEST group is a collaboration of TES trained surgeons across Canada at tertiary&#xD;
      care teaching hospitals, involved in research collaborations. The results of this study will&#xD;
      be used to see if randomization to two different bowel regimens in this very select group of&#xD;
      patients undergoing trans-anal surgery is feasible and can yield informative data. The study&#xD;
      will be powered for the primary objective, but we will be collecting data on numerous&#xD;
      secondary objectives which may show important trends. If the study proves to be feasible, the&#xD;
      next step would be to expand the study to several other centers across Canada as part of the&#xD;
      TEMPEST collaborative, in order to collect much larger datasets and the power to look much&#xD;
      more closely at not only the primary objective but also the secondary objectives.&#xD;
