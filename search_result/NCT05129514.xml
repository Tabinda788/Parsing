  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a course of daily manual lymphatic drainage&#xD;
      over the course of 5 days can improve lymphatic drainage function and cognitive outcomes and&#xD;
      to determine whether single sessions of manual lymphatic drainage improves lymphatic drainage&#xD;
      in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.&#xD;

    <measure>change in Near-Infrared Fluorescence Lymphatic Imaging (NIRF-LI) assessment of lymphatic drainage</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1, day 5</time_frame>
    <description>2 NIRF-LI sessions will be conducted separated by 3 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cognitive test results as assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Global health( GH) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>day1,day2,day3,day4,day5</time_frame>
    <description>Nine of the 10 PROMIS GH items are scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 5 representing the best health. Pain which is the 10th question is scored from 0(no pain) to 10(worst imaginable pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cognitive test results as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>day1,day2,day3,day4,day5</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of a set of 9 questions each scored form 0(not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), a higher score indicating a worse outcome. Total score ranges form 0-27.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cognitive test results as assessed by the Multilingual Aphasia Examination III-Controlled Oral Word Association</measure>
    <time_frame>day1,day2,day3,day4,day5</time_frame>
    <description>This is used to asses phonemic fluency. Participant is asked to name words that begin with a particular letter in one minute and examiner will write down the words said by the participant. This will be reported y the number of words participants say in one minute</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cognitive test results as assessed by the Trail Making Test(TMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>day1,day2,day3,day4,day5</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task; therefore, higher scores reveal greater impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cognitive test results as assessed by the learning trial</measure>
    <time_frame>day1,day2,day3,day4,day5</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the number of words participants can remember</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cognitive test results as assessed by the delayed recall trial instructions</measure>
    <time_frame>day1,day2,day3,day4,day5</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the number of words participants can remember after 20-25 minutes delay</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in cognitive test results as assessed by the Semantic Category learning trial</measure>
    <time_frame>day1,day2,day3,day4,day5</time_frame>
    <description>There are 12 words that participants will categories as Four-legged Animals, precious stones and human dwellings for a total score from 0-12 a higher number indicates a better outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in processing speed, as assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -IV</measure>
    <time_frame>day1,day2,day3,day4,day5</time_frame>
    <description>Two subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - IV are used (Coding and Symbol Search). Age-adjusted standard scores are calculated for each of subtest. The 2 subtest scores are then combined to create the Processing Speed Index. Processing Speed Index will be reported as a percentile (0% to 100%), with a higher percentile indicating a better outcome</description>

             subjects of non-childbearing potential, defined as physiologically incapable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, must meet the criteria listed on the Female Enrollment form, but&#xD;
             are not restricted to the use of contraception following study participation.&#xD;
