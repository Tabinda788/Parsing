    <textblock>
      Trigger points are hyper-irritable points, appear as nodules on palpation, discrete and focal&#xD;
      spots in the taut band of skeletal muscles. Usually these points are sensitive to pressure,&#xD;
      if direct compression is applied over them, that can evoke jump sign, tenderness and pain is&#xD;
      produced locally but it is referred to surrounding areas. There are many types of trigger&#xD;
      points on the basis of location, chronicity and tenderness. They are classified as central,&#xD;
      satellite, diffuse, inactive,and active. The trigger points can be developed by repetitive&#xD;
      overuse injuries or sustained loading like lifting heavy weight, carrying babies, bags,&#xD;
      briefcase etc. It can also be manifested by poor posture or prolonged period of inactivity&#xD;
      such as bed rest or sitting causing pain, reduced range of motion, muscle tightness. When&#xD;
      there are number of trigger points in muscles causing micro-cramps resulting in myofascial&#xD;
      pain syndrome. Trigger points are the areas of contracted muscles causing restriction of in&#xD;
      blood flow within the tissues. She claimed that by applying sustained pressure over trigger&#xD;
      points with thumbs, knuckles and elbow followed by stretching of the muscle produced much&#xD;
      better results compared to trigger point injections. Myofascial trigger points in lumbar&#xD;
      region play an important role in genesis of mechanical low back pain. The hyper-irritable&#xD;
      spots usually present within the taut band of skeletal muscles which on compression can give&#xD;
      rise to characteristics like; referred pain, autonomic phenomena like (sweating,&#xD;
      vasoconstriction and pilomotor activity) and motor dysfunction. It is essential to inquire&#xD;
      the gender differences in pain perception level because many diseases like migraine,&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, and low back pain are more common among females than males. Females not&#xD;
      only report more pain but they also experience more intense pain in their body parts as&#xD;
      compared to males. Factors like psychological and physiological contribute in difference in&#xD;
      pain perception among females and male. A study suggests that females show greater perception&#xD;
      towards pain threshold as compared to males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myofascial release technique is usually considered as alternative of medicine therapy highly&#xD;
      recommended to treat immobility of skeletal muscles and pain by improving blood circulation&#xD;
      and oxygen in these muscles and is non-invasive method. Moreover, it produces stretch reflex&#xD;
      in muscles. By applying sustained pressure for 30 seconds over the trigger points until the&#xD;
      patient's pain intensity is decreased considerably. As this pressure applied would help to&#xD;
      break the adhesive fibres connection within the muscle helping to push out the blood&#xD;
      containing waste products and toxins because after 30 seconds fresh blood containing&#xD;
      nutrients will flow and trigger points are released.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is also a professional practice to treat&#xD;
      soft tissues. Moreover, IASTM mainly decreases pain sensitivity and pain threshold of&#xD;
      myofascial trigger points. It is applied by using the instrument made up of stainless steel&#xD;
      with edges and contours according to different body locations allowing deeper penetration&#xD;
      treating soft tissue disorders. Instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization is master&#xD;
      intervention using specialized tool to manipulate the skin , muscles, myofascial, tendons by&#xD;
      various direct compressive strokes. IASTM technique is very effective as it effectively break&#xD;
      the restrictions in fascia and scar tissue. Adhesions may developed within the soft tissue&#xD;
      after surgery, immobilization, strain, are broken down by using this instrument allowing full&#xD;
      restoration of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tool I am using in my study for instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization technique is&#xD;
      M2T Blade technique is a multifunctional instrument invented by Adam Broger consisting of&#xD;
      many planes and is very effective in treating pain and spasm. M2T Blade is a new invention&#xD;
      and it is beneficial in reducing myofascial pain. Its efficacy is proven over soft tissues&#xD;
      that it releases fascial tightness. Moreover it also improves range of motion of a joint.&#xD;
      Highly loaded blades are designed to provide a specific distribution is given. The&#xD;
      three-dimensional analysis methodology is used here.&#xD;
