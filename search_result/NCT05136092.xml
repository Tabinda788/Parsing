  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study is designed to investigate the specific uptake of fructose by human&#xD;
      colorectal tumors. In this study, subjects with colorectal cancer undergoing surgery will&#xD;
      receive an oral sugar solution containing fructose or xylose prior to surgery. The tumor will&#xD;
      then be resected, and a portion of the tissue will be used to measure the abundance of&#xD;
      fructose and xylose. The study hypothesis is that the tumors will take up fructose sugar but&#xD;
      not xylose sugar. A comparison of the sugar uptake between the tumor and normal tissues from&#xD;
      the adjacent intestinal epithelium and smooth muscle and the liver will be conducted. This&#xD;
      proposal will confirm that human colorectal cancer tumors can directly absorb dietary sugars,&#xD;
      which has never been demonstrated.&#xD;

      This prospective pilot study is designed to investigate the uptake of dietary fructose and&#xD;
      xylose by primary human colon tumors. In this study, the recruited patients with colorectal&#xD;
      cancer will receive an oral sugar solution containing either Fructose sugar or Xylose sugar&#xD;
      before surgery. The tumor will then be resected and a portion of the tumor, normal intestinal&#xD;
      tissue, blood, urine, and liver will be used to quantify fructose and xylose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research question Can primary human tumors take up fructose or xylose?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A statement of the hypothesis The hypothesis is that fructose, but not xylose, can be&#xD;
           directly absorbed and stored by primary human colon tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design Prospective, non-randomized, pilot, feasibility, single-center, open-label, phase&#xD;
           1, investigator-initiated study to evaluate the uptake of dietary fructose and xylose by&#xD;
           primary human colon tumors with 12 subjects in 2 cohorts: Cohort 1: 6 subjects will&#xD;
           consume a sugar solution containing fructose and Cohort 2: 6 subjects will consume a&#xD;
           sugar solution containing xylose. Eligible subjects that are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
           colorectal resection for cancer treatment will be invited to participate in the study in&#xD;
           consecutive order from the practice of colorectal surgeons at the time of their&#xD;
           preoperative clinic visit. First, Cohort 1 subjects will be enrolled followed by the&#xD;
           Cohort 2 subjects.&#xD;
