  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD7503, following&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) administration of single ascending doses of AZD7503 in healthy&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, First-in-Human, study in healthy males and females (non-childbearing&#xD;
      potential) participants. In this study up to four dose levels of AZD7503 are planned to be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned doses of AZD7503 are dose 1, dose 2, dose 3, and dose 4. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomised to receive either AZD7503 or placebo. The study will include four single&#xD;
      dose cohorts with an option to include two cohorts based on emerging data from planned&#xD;
      cohorts in the study and two additional cohorts of Japanese participants and one cohort of&#xD;
      Chinese participants will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will be proceeded with sentinel dosing strategy. Here,&#xD;
      sentinel sub-cohort will be included, such that 1 participant will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      placebo and 1 participant will be randomised to receive AZD7503. The safety data from the&#xD;
      sentinel participants up to 24 hours post-dose will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      (PI) before the remaining participants in the cohort are dosed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Treatment Period during which participants will be resident at the Study Centre from&#xD;
           the day before study medication administration (Day -1) until at least 72 hours after&#xD;
           study medication administration; discharged from the Study Centre on Day 4;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Visits on 1,2,4,6 and 8 weeks; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Final Follow-up Visit 10 weeks after the last study medication dose. Each participant&#xD;
           will be involved in the study for approximately 14 weeks.&#xD;
