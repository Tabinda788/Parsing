      This study conduct a two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. The study will&#xD;
      recruit and randomize 900 smokers (n=450 per arm) to either: (1) Control: Standard Smoking&#xD;
      Cessation Counseling or (2) Intervention: Integrated Financial-Smoking Cessation Counseling.&#xD;

      The study researchers will conduct a two-arm, parallel-group RCT. Study researchers will&#xD;
      recruit and randomize 900 low-income smokers (n=450 per arm) to either: (1) Control: Standard&#xD;
      Smoking Cessation Counseling or (2) Intervention: Integrated Financial-Smoking Cessation&#xD;
      Counseling. Both groups will receive 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy. Study&#xD;
      researchers will survey participants at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to assess outcomes&#xD;
      and mechanisms, and biochemically verify self-reported abstinence at 12 months (our primary&#xD;
      outcome). Study researchers will assess and compare the costs and cost-per-quit in the two&#xD;
      treatment arms&#xD;

    <description>The study will collect both salivary cotinine and exhaled CO from participants reporting 7-day abstinence from cigarettes on the 12-month survey. The study will use a saliva collection kit supplied by Salimetrics Inc. and a coVita Co monitor that provides an immediate CO concentration reading in single parts per million (ppm). Participants will be classified as negative for salivary cotinine if their concentration is &lt;10ng/ml and negative for exhaled CO if their concentration is &lt;8 ppm.</description>
