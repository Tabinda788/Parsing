  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial tissue is a hormonal-dependent tissue in both pre- and postmenopausal period. The&#xD;
      endometrial cells are expressing receptors for all sex hormones, mainly for estrogen,&#xD;
      progesterone and androgens. The proper response of the endometrial cells on hormones is&#xD;
      crucial for a well-balanced fluctuation of endometrial tissue. If, for any reason, these&#xD;
      responses are altered, this may lead to benign or malignant lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The androgens, through their receptors, decrease the proliferation of the endometrial cells.&#xD;
      After menopause, the number of androgens receptors (ARs) increases in proportion to estrogen&#xD;
      receptors and this may lead to endometrial atrophy. If the functionality of ARs is decreased,&#xD;
      the effect of estrogen increases and this may possibly lead to endometrial hyperplasia or to&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. The AR gene is located on the X chromosome and consists of 8 exons.&#xD;
      Genetic research has shown that on exon 1, there is an area of trinucleotide Cytosine-&#xD;
      Adenosine- Guanin (CAG) repeats which controls the functionality of the receptor. The more&#xD;
      CAG repeats, the less responsive the receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to study the AR gene polymorphism and particularly the number of&#xD;
      CAG repeats on exon 1, in patients with known endometrial pathology (benign and malignant).&#xD;
      The results will be compared with a random sample of the general population without&#xD;
      endometrial pathology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of CAG repeats on the AR is well established in degenerative neurological diseases&#xD;
      in prostate and breast cancer, but the corresponding role in endometrial benign or malignant&#xD;
      lesions is not well studied. It seems that there is a gap in the international literature&#xD;
      since the results of the published studies are conflicting. A meta-analysis of 51 studies&#xD;
      published by Qin et al. in 2017, suggested that the carriers of short polymorphic CAG repeats&#xD;
      might increase the risk of prostate cancer, and could be used as a potential detecting&#xD;
      marker. Another meta-analysis of 17 studies concluded that the longest CAG repeats increase&#xD;
      the risk of breast cancer. Both those cancers are testosterone dependent and the higher the&#xD;
      testosterone serum levels, the greater the cancer risk. Among women, the highest testosterone&#xD;
      serum levels are observed in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients. A study published&#xD;
      in 2020 concluded that the risk of PCOS is associated with the inheritance of ARs with&#xD;
      shorter CAG repeats.Even though a meta-analysis of 11 studies demonstrate no evident&#xD;
      association between the CAG length in AR gene and PCOS risk, the CAG length appears to be&#xD;
      positively associated with higher testosterone levels. However, larger scale case-control&#xD;
      studies are needed to validate the results. The rationale of the present study is to&#xD;
      contribute to the literature by correlating the number of CAG repeats on AR with specific&#xD;
      endometrial benign or malignant lesions. This may result in a better understanding of the&#xD;
      nature of endometrial lesions and the development of specific clinical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to study the AR gene polymorphism and particularly the number of&#xD;
      CAG repeats on exon 1, in patients with known endometrial pathology (benign and malignant).&#xD;
      The results will be compared with a random sample of the general population without&#xD;
      endometrial pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact on science, economy and society Adrenal receptor gene polymorphism seems to be related&#xD;
      to many clinical conditions. Studying the AR gene polymorphism in relation to endometrial&#xD;
      functionality will provide better understanding of the physiology of endometrial tissue&#xD;
      function, the natural progression of endometrial lesions, as well as the potential of&#xD;
      recurrence of those lesions after treatment. This may lead to the modification of therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions and to the development of screening tests in high-risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable&#xD;
      research policies and procedures and all applicable laws and regulations. All episodes of&#xD;
      noncompliance will be documented. The investigators will perform the study in accordance with&#xD;
      this protocol, will obtain consent and assent, and will report unanticipated problems&#xD;
      involving risks to subjects. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate&#xD;
      and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
