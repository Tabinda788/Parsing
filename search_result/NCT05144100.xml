      The oropharyngeal areas mainly comprises of the tonsil, base tongue (BOT), soft palate and&#xD;
      the posterior pharyngeal wall. Traditionally, surgical resection of oropharyngeal cancers&#xD;
      (OPC) was a standard procedure, often performed through mutilating incisions with&#xD;
      mandibulotomies, rendering significant post-operative functional deficits. Over the past 2&#xD;
      decades, there has been a major shift in treatment strategy with a majority of these cancers&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The oropharyngeal region primarily comprises the tonsil, base tongue (BOT), soft palate and&#xD;
      posterior pharyngeal wall. Traditionally, surgical resection of oropharyngeal cancers (OPC)&#xD;
      was a standard procedure, often performed through mutilating incisions with mandibulotomies,&#xD;
      rendering significant post-operative functional deficits. Over the past 2 decades, there has&#xD;
      been a major shift in treatment strategy with a majority of these cancers now being treated&#xD;
      by primary concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) with a trend towards organ and function&#xD;
      preservation. The landmark trial determining effective treatment options for OPCs was by the&#xD;
      RTOG group (0129) that provided strong evidence for HPV status being an independent&#xD;
      prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), with these&#xD;
      patients having significantly improved outcomes. Furthermore, after adjusting for&#xD;
      demographics, T stage, N stage and smoking status, the HPV positive population had a 58%&#xD;
      reduction in the risk of death and a 51% reduction in risk of progression or death. Most of&#xD;
      the discussion today in HPV positive OPC is based on treatment- intensification to improve&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more concerning issue is the poor outcome, both survival, and QOL, seen in the &quot;high-risk&quot;&#xD;
      HPV negative OPCs. When treated with radical CCRT, HPV negative patients have substantially&#xD;
      reduced survival, both in terms of locoregional control (LRC) and OS. In the RTOG 0129, the&#xD;
      HPV negative population had a 25.1% reduction in OS at 3 years (57.1% vs 82.4%) when compared&#xD;
      to patients with HPV positive tumors. The locoregional relapse rate at 3 years was 21% higher&#xD;
      in these patients (35.1% vs 13.6% for HPV positive tumors). Moreover, the salvage rates in&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancers that have undergone radical CCRT are quite low with only a third of the&#xD;
      recurrences being amenable for salvage surgery. This led to a trend of intensification of&#xD;
      management for these HPV negative tumors with altered fractionation schema,CCRT, multi-drug&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy and targeted molecular therapies. Even with all these efforts, simply&#xD;
      altering the method of radiation delivery, dosing and/or adding different types of concurrent&#xD;
      chemotherapy is not seeming to be sufficient to improve oncologic outcomes in HPV negative&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the contemporary literature, an approach to further intensify treatment would be the&#xD;
      addition of upfront surgery on this high-risk HPV negative OPCs. The recent advances in head&#xD;
      neck surgery incorporate minimally invasive techniques and some focus around a transoral&#xD;
      approach. These include transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) and transoral robotic surgery&#xD;
      (TORS). Compared to the open approaches, these have minimal or no external incisions and do&#xD;
      not require morbid access procedures. TLM is a surgical technique used in combination with an&#xD;
      endoscope or direct laryngoscopy, operating microscope and a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser. TORS&#xD;
      is performed using a robotic system, the arms of which are placed within the patient's mouth&#xD;
      but controlled by a surgeon sitting at a remote console. The surgeon is provided with an&#xD;
      endoscopically derived 3-dimensional view used to perform an enblocresection of the&#xD;
      oropharyngeal tumor. Open surgery today incorporates modified techniques in osteotomy design,&#xD;
      fixation and reconstruction methods to reduce and/or eliminate the traditional complications&#xD;
      and have the additional advantage of direct visualization of the tumor. To add to this,&#xD;
      radiotherapy techniques have also improved with more concentrated dosing obtained with&#xD;
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) resulting in fewer complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrespective of the management received, patients with oropharyngeal tumors have a&#xD;
      significant impact on the swallowing function and quality of life (QOL). Multiple factors are&#xD;
      thought to contribute to the severity of this dysphagia, including multimodality therapy&#xD;
      (surgery, RT, chemotherapy), total radiation dose, dosimetry to organs at risk (OAR) and&#xD;
      intrinsic patient radiosensitivity and susceptibility to fibrosis. Majority of the current&#xD;
      data on QOL are from single institution studies. Sinclair et al found that patients&#xD;
      undergoing TORS for early OPCs have an initial decrease in mean dysphagia scores using the MD&#xD;
      Anderson Dysphagia Inventory-Head and Neck (MDADI-HN) in the immediate postoperative period&#xD;
      when compared to baseline pre-operative scores, although a gradual increasing improvement was&#xD;
      observed over time. The global and physical subscales were most affected in the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period with the recovery of scores observed at last follow up. Postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy predicted gastrostomy tube dependence for greater than 3 months. Hurtuk et al&#xD;
      have shown a decrease from baseline immediately after surgery in speech, eating, aesthetic,&#xD;
      social, and overall QOL domains, using the Head and Neck Cancer Inventory (HNCI). However, at&#xD;
      1 year, the health-related QOL in the aesthetic, social, and overall domains were high.&#xD;
      Eating function and attitude were the only variables not returning to the high domain. In&#xD;
      another population-based analysis of head neck cancers, oropharyngeal cancers had the&#xD;
      second-highest prevalence of dysphagia, with 31% of patients demonstrating elevated episodes&#xD;
      of aspiration relative to baseline greater than 1 year after receiving treatment. Weinstein&#xD;
      et al reported long-term dependence on tracheostomy and gastrostomy was seen in 2.4% and 5%,&#xD;
      respectively.(21) Even in the RTOG study,43% of the patients had severe long-term Grade 3 or&#xD;
      4 toxicity requiring a feeding tube/gastrostomy for more than 2 years or longer and death&#xD;
      without cancer progression. Nichols et al recently attempted to answer some of these&#xD;
      questions (ORATOR trial) in a randomized trial for early OPCs treated with CCRT versus TORS.&#xD;
      They found the MDADI scores at 1-year were statistically superior in the RT arm (p = 0.042),&#xD;
      but not meeting the definition of a clinically meaningful change (powered to detect a&#xD;
      10-point improvement). For the other QOL metrics, outcomes were similar at 1-year. Feeding&#xD;
      tube rates were 3% in the RT arm vs 0% in the TORS arm. Even the rates of treatment-related&#xD;
      grade ≥2 adverse events (AEs) were similar, with more neutropenia, constipation, and tinnitus&#xD;
      in the RT arm and more trismus in the TORS arm. The findings of aspiration on modified barium&#xD;
      swallow (MBS) have been significantly predictive of pneumonia in many trials of chemotherapy&#xD;
      and IMRT in oropharyngeal cancer (p=0.017, Sensitivity 80%, Specificity 60%), and silent&#xD;
      aspiration was evident on MBS studies in 63% of patients who developed pneumonia. In&#xD;
      addition, pharyngeal residue in MBS studies was significantly associated with the development&#xD;
      of pneumonia after chemotherapy and IMRT (p&lt;0.01). These results offer compelling support for&#xD;
      the examination of objective swallowing impairment (ie, &quot;airway protection&quot; and &quot;pharyngeal&#xD;
      transit&quot;) as these health-related endpoints cannot be obtained by patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      (PROs) measures alone. Even the long-term results of RTOG 9111 study showed unknown mortality&#xD;
      in 30% of the patients who received chemo-radiation, possibly due to silent aspiration.&#xD;
      Hence, a lot of unanswered questions remain in determining the optimum management of OPCS&#xD;
      that have minimal complications and maximum survival advantage.&#xD;

    <description>Patients would undergo appropriate surgery via open, endoscopic, TLM, TORS or a combination. The primary and the neck would be addressed. For N0 neck, clearance of levels II-IV will be required, with levels I and/or V electively dissected at the discretion of the operating surgeon and based on extension of nodal disease. For N+ neck and tumors approaching to within 1cm of the midline, we recommend a contralateral neck dissection be performed as well of levels II-IV but to be done as per operating team's discretion. For lateralized lesions of the BOT and tonsil, ipsilateral neck dissection will be performed. A minimum of 18 lymph nodes per dissected side of the neck is required and will be subject to quality assurance review</description>
