  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating difficulties in infants and young children are defined as all the difficulties in&#xD;
      feeding oneself in an appropriate and satisfactory manner. These disorders affect&#xD;
      approximately 20 to 25% of infants and young children, and thus constitute one of the most&#xD;
      frequent reasons for consultation in these age groups. Many of these children continue to be&#xD;
      received in consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies show that the lack of intraoral exploration in children could be associated with&#xD;
      later difficulties in accepting different textures or new foods. Our clinical examination of&#xD;
      sensorimotor functions shows signs of sensory hyper reactivity that are very common in&#xD;
      children who always wipe their hands when in contact with food or sticky objects and for&#xD;
      those who experience difficulty in brushing or grooming themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all of the publications available which includes pubmed, there is no mention of the lack&#xD;
      of exploration of objects and the stigma of sensory hyper-responsiveness even if this latter&#xD;
      was not entirely detailed in the descriptions made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial hypothesis is that this exploration defect corresponds to early sensory&#xD;
      hyperreactivity which also plays a deleterious role in the acceptance of new textures and new&#xD;
      foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial we propose a comparison study with a controlled population of children without&#xD;
      eating difficulties as defined by the Montreal MCH score to validate a statistical link&#xD;
      between the difficulties in food diversification beyond 18 months and the lack of exploration&#xD;
      of the environment with 'mouthing' between 6 and 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will analyse consultation questionnaires dedicated to eating difficulties&#xD;
      retrospectively (patients) and will compare them with questionnaires of children from&#xD;
      daycares without eating difficulties (controls).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct this study the controls will be recruited from daycares and different nursery&#xD;
      schools after agreement with the heads of establishments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two questionnaires along with an information note will be distributed to the parents and will&#xD;
      be completed in a non-identifying manner, retrieved by the teachers and then sent to the&#xD;
      principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires include the validated Montreal HME questionnaire which will detect the&#xD;
      possible existence of eating difficulties and a more general questionnaire on the psychomotor&#xD;
      development of the child (not validated because a qualitative questionnaire without a score).&#xD;
      The collection of data will be prospective for controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on the other hand will be recruited retrospectively from the dedicated oral&#xD;
      consultation at the Hospital.&#xD;
