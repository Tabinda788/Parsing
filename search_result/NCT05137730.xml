  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of Part I of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of a new&#xD;
      formulation compared with the approved formulation when a single dose of rhPTH(1-84) is given&#xD;
      to healthy volunteers. Bioavailability is the ability of a drug to be absorbed and used by&#xD;
      the body. In Part II, the main aim is to assess the dose linearity of the new formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 2 doses in Part I and 4 doses in Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants need to visit their doctor approximately 14 days and 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
      of study drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will be conducted in two parts (Part I and Part II). Part I consists of two&#xD;
      treatment periods with 2 sequences and part II consists of four treatment periods with 4&#xD;
      sequences. In Part I, relative bioavailability of Formulation A (Test: 100 microgram [mcg]&#xD;
      rhPTH[1-84]) will be compared with Formulation B (Reference: 100 mcg rhPTH[1-84]). In Part&#xD;
      II, dose linearity of the new formulation, Formulation A, of rhPTH (1-84) will be assessed&#xD;
      based on 4 different dose levels as dose c - f (dose c = 25 mcg, dose d = 50 mcg, dose e = 75&#xD;
      mcg and f = 200 mcg). Both parts may be conducted concurrently.&#xD;
