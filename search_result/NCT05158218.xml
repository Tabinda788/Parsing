  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design will consist of a cohort of adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy&#xD;
      (CP) that will undergo a gait training protocol. All participants will complete MEG baseline&#xD;
      brain imaging measures of their sensorimotor cortical activity, MRI brain/spinal cord imaging&#xD;
      (previous MRI or template brain may be substituted), neurophysiological tests of the spinal&#xD;
      cord H-reflex, and a series of mobility clinical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the baseline tests, the participants with CP will undergo the therapeutic&#xD;
      gait training using either traditional physical therapy or utilizing a robotic exoskeleton.&#xD;
      After completing all of the therapeutic gait training sessions, the participants will repeat&#xD;
      the same assessments that were completed at baseline. The two groups will be compared based&#xD;
      on the assessments for therapeutic outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) results from a perinatal brain injury and is one of the most prevalent&#xD;
      and costly pediatric neurologic conditions in the United States that often results in&#xD;
      mobility deficits. The investigator's extensive experimental work has been focused on&#xD;
      developing a therapeutic gait training protocol that will improve the long-term mobility of&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults with CP. Robotic exoskeletons have gained recent attention in&#xD;
      the therapeutic community as a high-tech option for assisting with over-ground mobility of&#xD;
      various patient populations. The goal of this investigation is to take a fresh new approach&#xD;
      on how robotic exoskeletons can be used in a therapeutic setting. As opposed to using them as&#xD;
      a compensation tool, we are proposing to use them to perturb the legs to drive beneficial&#xD;
      neuroplasticity in the key brain areas that govern the leg motor actions. Essentially, we&#xD;
      predict that the neuroplastic changes promoted by the exoskeleton gait training protocol will&#xD;
      lead to more robust clinical outcomes than what is seen by gait training alone. The aims of&#xD;
      this study will: (1) determine if individuals with CP that undergo a robotic exoskeleton gait&#xD;
      training protocol have larger mobility improvements compared to those that undergo gait&#xD;
      training alone, (2) determine if individuals that undergo a robotic exoskeleton gait training&#xD;
      protocol have larger improvements in key brain areas involved in motor planning and execution&#xD;
      of the leg motor actions compared to those that undergo gait training alone, and (3)&#xD;
      determine if individuals with CP that undergo a robotic exoskeleton gait training protocol&#xD;
      have larger mobility improvements compared to those that undergo gait training alone. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized after exoskeleton gait training participants will demonstrate substantially&#xD;
      greater improvements in their 10-meter walk speed, one-minute walk test, and Functional Gait&#xD;
      Assessment scores. Additionally, following exoskeleton training, the sensorimotor cortical&#xD;
      activity will be significantly different from what is seen in those receiving gait training&#xD;
      alone. Furthermore, the degree of brain activity changes will be related to the extent of the&#xD;
      mobility improvements seen after completing the exoskeleton gait training protocol. Briefly,&#xD;
      the study design consists of a cohort of adolescents and young adults with CP that will&#xD;
      initially undergo MEG brain imaging, MRI spinal cord imaging, neurophysiological tests of the&#xD;
      spinal cord interneuronal circuitry, and clinical mobility assessments. After completing the&#xD;
      baseline tests, the participants will undergo either traditional therapeutic gait training or&#xD;
      utilize the robotic exoskeleton gait therapy. Upon completion of the treatment program,&#xD;
      participants will undergo the same baseline assessments. The results from the post therapy&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared between the two groups: traditional gait therapy and robotic&#xD;
      exoskeleton.&#xD;

    <measure>Cognitive related changes induced via physical therapy - Caregiver Priorities &amp; Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (CP and Neurotypical) and 8 weeks (CP)</time_frame>
    <description>Children with severe developmental disabilities are often dependent on parents/caregivers for much of their daily needs. These children often have multiple co-morbid conditions which can have a significant impact on their overall health and quality of life. Interventions are aimed at preserving or improving their health, comfort and quality of life and to facilitate caregiving. CP CHILD is an instrument that aims to measure these phenomena. Respondents rate a number of areas including the difficulty of activities for their child (Scale ranging from 0-Not Possible to 6-No problem at all) and choose the level of assistance needed to perform these activities (Scale ranging from 0-Total to 3-Independent), how often their child experience pain or discomfort (Scale ranging from 0-Every day to 5-None of the time) and intensity (0-Severe to 3-None), importance of items in child's quality of life (0-Least Important to 5-Most Important), and overall health of child (0-Very Poor to 5-Excellent).</description>

    <description>The training protocol will consist of 24-treatment sessions that will be performed 3 times-a-week for an 8-week period. All therapeutic exercises will be performed under the direction of a licensed physical therapist. Any sessions missed will be added on to the 8-week period. Each intervention session will be completed in a 60-minute sessions with rests as needed. The key components of the therapy will include: 1) optimally challenging activities of variable intensity that emphasize motor planning and problem solving that requires altering the leg kinematics to meet the environmental and task constraints, 2) task specific overground movements that promote building a repertoire of mobility strategies that can be utilized in the community, and 3) motor tasks requiring active control that increase participant therapeutic engagement. An overhead body weight support system or a gait-belt may be used for some individuals during the robotic exoskeleton gait training blocks.</description>
