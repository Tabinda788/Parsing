  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the techniques of bariatric surgery, the gastric Y bypass according to Roux (RYGB)&#xD;
      allows greater weight loss and more lasting over time than sleeve gastrectomy and gastric&#xD;
      banding. However, around 20% of patients will regain weight within 24 months after surgery.&#xD;
      Among the many mechanisms that lead to weight regain, we can mention distension of the&#xD;
      gastric pouch and gastro-jejunal anastomosis. A reoperation is then necessary. Argan plasma&#xD;
      coagulation intervention (APC) by endoscopy allows to reduce the caliber of the&#xD;
      gastro-jejunal anastomosis. The aim of the study is to show the efficacy of APC associated&#xD;
      with multidisciplinary medical management and to compare it with multidisciplinary medical&#xD;
      management alone in weight regain of patients.&#xD;

    <description>On D0, in the operating room, argon plasma coagulation will be performed around the perimeter of the anastomosis for a period of 5 to 10 min under general anesthesia. The removal of the catheter and the endoscope will be carried out under control. Patients will be kept under surveillance the night following the procedure. A liquid diet will be prescribed for 10 days. The follow-up will be carried out on an outpatient basis with a control endoscopy at 2 months, followed by a new procedure in the event of an anastomosis larger than 1.5 cm. A new endoscopic check will be carried out at 4 months if an argon plasma coagulation was performed during the previous check, with a third and last argon plasma coagulation if an anastomosis of more than 1.5 cm persists. The number of procedures will therefore be a maximum of 3. A control endoscopy will be performed at one year for the final control of the anastomosis.</description>
