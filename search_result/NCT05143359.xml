    <textblock>
      Accuracy of the variables used in Wharfe assessment and Pederson difficulty index for&#xD;
      impacted mandibular third molar surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower 3rd molar tooth is one of the most frequently impacted teeth. Its prevalence ranges&#xD;
      from 30.3% to 68.6% worldwide according to a study conducted by Sekhar, 2020. The impaction&#xD;
      of a tooth can be defined as a pathological condition in which eruption of tooth is not&#xD;
      normal i.e. it is not erupted as expected within a specific time period. The impaction&#xD;
      renders the affected tooth as non-functional due to its postural instability/ abnormal&#xD;
      position. The normal tooth eruption is dependent on several local as well as systemic&#xD;
      factors. Normal eruption can be altered by neighboring tooth, excessive soft tissue in the&#xD;
      surrounding, or the dense overlying bone. Race and Ethnicity an also affect/ alter the&#xD;
      impaction rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The removal of 3rd mandibular molar/ wisdom tooth is one of the most commonly performed&#xD;
      surgical procedures, being done in dental clinics on daily basis. To predict the difficulty&#xD;
      level of this procedure for impacted lower 3rd molar, no scoring system/ scale is considered&#xD;
      sufficient i.e. every scale takes some factors into account, while missing some factors, so&#xD;
      clinically not very much reliable. Some of the proposed scales/ models which are clinically&#xD;
      in use are as follows: WHARFE's, Pederson's, Winter's, and Pell and Gregory's model.&#xD;

      The removal of 3rd mandibular molar/ wisdom tooth is one of the most commonly performed&#xD;
      surgical procedures, being done in dental clinics on daily basis. To predict the difficulty&#xD;
      level of this procedure for impacted lower 3rd molar, no scoring system/ scale is considered&#xD;

      clinically not very much reliable. Some of the proposed scales/ models which are clinically&#xD;
      in use are as follows: WHARFE's, Pederson's, Winter's, and Pell and Gregory's model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHARFE's scoring system is a common classification/ system for the difficulty assessment&#xD;
      while planning to remove a 3rd mandibular molar tooth. WHARFE stands for Winter's lines,&#xD;
      Height of mandible, Angulation, Root, shape, &amp; morphology, Follicular size, Exit pathway for&#xD;
      tooth. This system helps to examine a tooth in more detail and its radiological status before&#xD;
      planning any intervention to 3rd molar. While, Pederson's difficulty assessing scale is to&#xD;
      predict the pre-operative and operative difficulty while riming the 3rd Mandibular Molar&#xD;
      tooth that is impacted. It takes into account following variables: spatial relationship,&#xD;
      depth, and ramus relationship. It is reported as slightly difficult (score 3-4), moderately&#xD;
      difficult (score 5-6), and very difficult (score 7-10) with relation to the scores mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While doing research, I found that there is a handsome data available on different clinical&#xD;
      scoring systems and their practical significance. But, I found the paucity of literature on&#xD;
      the comparison of the variables used in Pederson's and WHARFE's scoring systems with&#xD;
      practical procedures. So, this study was planned to assess the credibility of these&#xD;
      variables. This study will also explore whether these systems are sufficient enough to rely&#xD;
      upon, while (intelligently) planning intervention in the patients presenting with lower 3rd&#xD;
      molar impaction. It will surely help to broaden the horizon of knowledge, followed by&#xD;
      suggesting some guidelines to improve the clinical practice while treating these patients.&#xD;
      The relevant data will be taken from participants and their relevant investigation results&#xD;
      will be noted down in the pre-designed Performa (attached). This data will be interpreted in&#xD;
      the SPSS version 23.0 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) program and will be&#xD;
      followed by recommendations to improve the health care standards in Pakistan. This will&#xD;
      ultimately update the knowledge and clinical approach of treating Oral &amp; Maxillofacial&#xD;
      Surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Study Setting: The study will be conducted in the Oral &amp; Maxillofacial&#xD;
      Department on the patients visiting Dr Ishrat-ul-Ebad Khan Institute of Oral Health Sciences/&#xD;
      DUHS Karachi on outdoor basis or indoor basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after the approval of synopsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 281 cases is calculated as sample size, from online calculator (from&#xD;
      www.openepi.com) keeping confidence interval of 95% and the power of 80%, while taking the&#xD;
      difficulty index as 24%, of molar teeth as 'very difficult' to operate, when Pederson scale&#xD;
      index was applied. (Sekhar, M., Singh, S., &amp; Valluri, R et al. Correlation of Variables for&#xD;
      WHARFE Assessment and Pederson Difficulty Index for Impacted Mandibular Third Molar Surgery-A&#xD;

&#xD;
      Sampling Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposive non-probability sampling technique would be used for the selection of patients.&#xD;
