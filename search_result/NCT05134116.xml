  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SafeBoosC-III 2 year follow up study will follow up on all patients randomised in the&#xD;
      SafeBoosC-III clinical trial (NCT03770741). The investigators will collect data when the&#xD;
      patients are two years of corrected age from routine standardised follow up assessments,&#xD;
      parental questionnaires as well as informal assessments. The study will commence in September&#xD;
      2021, and will expect to include all 72 sites across 18 countries, which take part of the&#xD;
      SafeBoosC-III clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the SafeBoosC-III trial, the objective is to investigate the effect of treatment based on&#xD;
      cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring of brain oxygenation compared with&#xD;
      treatment as usual in extremely preterm infants. The primary outcome of the trial is death or&#xD;
      survival with severe brain injury at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Despite an association&#xD;
      between severe brain injury diagnosed in the neonatal period and later neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disability, this relationship is not always strong. Therefore, if treatment based on cerebral&#xD;
      NIRS monitoring decreases the risks of death or survival with severe brain injury, it is&#xD;
      important to document if the beneficial effect persists into early childhood, in the form of&#xD;
      better neurodevelopmental outcome. Furthermore, it is also important to identify evidence of&#xD;
      unexpected harms. It would be unfortunate if cerebral NIRS monitoring became standard&#xD;
      practice without good evidence that long-term patient-relevant benefits outweigh possible&#xD;
      harms. As the SafeBoosC-III trial intends to randomise 1600 infants, there is potential to&#xD;
      achieve sufficient power for a meaningful assessment of the experimental intervention's&#xD;
      effect on long-term neurodevelopment, as well as an evaluation of unexpected harms. The&#xD;
      objective of the SafeBoosC III follow-up study is to investigate the benefits and harms of&#xD;
      treatment guided by cerebral NIRS monitoring of brain oxygenation in extremely preterm&#xD;
      infants during the first 72 hours of life, assessed at two years' corrected age. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the intervention will decrease a composite of death or moderate-or-severe&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disability at two years' corrected age, and/or increase cognitive function&#xD;
      in survivors assessed by the Bayley III/IV test, with insignificant harms. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to collect data on as many children as possible and will do this by collecting clinical&#xD;
      data from health care records as well as answers from parental questionnaires.&#xD;
