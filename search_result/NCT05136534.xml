  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients underwent inguinal hernia repair with the Trabucco's technique (15), performed&#xD;
      by the same surgical team. Every patient was adequately informed of the procedural sequence&#xD;
      of anesthesia and surgery and signed informed consent before being enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, patients received mild sedation with Midazolam 0.03 mg/kg i.v.; Paracetamol&#xD;
      1 gr and Ketorolac 30 mg i.v. were given before surgery as multimodal pre-emptive analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A Subarachnoid anesthesia was performed with a 27G Whitacre needle at L2-L3 interspace,&#xD;
      with patients on the lateral decubitus corresponding to the side of surgery. The introducer&#xD;
      was inserted in the middle point of the space between two spinous processes, with a slightly&#xD;
      cranial direction. The spinal needle was passed through the introducer and advanced till the&#xD;
      subarachnoid space was reached, as confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, 60 mg of Prilocaine 2% were administered in the subarachnoid space, with a&#xD;
      low-flow injection technique and the needle bevel turned laterally towards the sloping&#xD;
      surgical side. Lateral decubitus was maintained for at least 10 minutes (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 15 minutes from spinal anesthesia execution, and before surgery started, sensory and motor&#xD;
      block were assessed by ice-test and numerical 0-3 Bromage Scale, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B Patients underwent surgery with local anesthesia (Mepivacaine 2%) performed by the&#xD;
      surgeon before skin incision. Further infiltrations of local anesthetic were ensured in case&#xD;
      of pain during the surgery, for a maximum of 400 mg of mepivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of uncontrolled pain, fentanyl 50 mcg i.v. was given for a maximum of two&#xD;
      intraoperative administrations. If pain persisted, a deep sedation was performed with&#xD;
      propofol continuous i.v. infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment was performed using a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Intraoperative pain&#xD;
      was assessed every 10 minutes,&#xD;
