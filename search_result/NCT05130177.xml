      This is a single-arm two-stage phase II study of PD-1 inhibitor zimberelimab (AB122) in&#xD;
      combination with TIGIT inhibitor domvanalimab (AB154) in advanced melanoma patients who have&#xD;
      failed PD-1 inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a 28-day screening evaluation consisting of systemic staging scans,&#xD;
      tumor biopsy, and blood studies to confirm suitability. Once enrolled, patients will receive&#xD;
      zimberelimab 360 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) and domvanalimab 15 mg/kg Q3W. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      restaging scans at W9 following 3 cycles of therapy with response assessed using RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      and iRECIST. Following restaging scans, patients with response will continue to receive&#xD;
      zimberelimab and domvanalimab till disease progression, intolerable toxicity or for up to 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
