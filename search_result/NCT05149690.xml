  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 people diagnosed with non-specific chronic low back pain of more than 3 months&#xD;
      of evolution and who are not currently undergoing any type of treatment will be recruited,&#xD;
      with ages between 30 and 65 years. A random distribution will be made into two treatment&#xD;
      groups (diathermy combined with supervised therapeutic exercise versus supervised therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise). Participants will receive treatment once a week for a period of three weeks, in&#xD;
      the physiotherapy laboratories of the University of Almería, with a follow-up evaluation at&#xD;
      three weeks and two months after the start of treatment. At their first visit, participants&#xD;
      will be screened for study eligibility according to the study inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and will be evaluated by a therapist blinded to the intervention. After this&#xD;
      face-to-face evaluation, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups and will&#xD;
      receive treatment for low back pain according to their random assignment group by two&#xD;
      therapists belonging to the research group and trained in the techniques used.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After randomization, participants will be assigned to the experimental group (9 sessions of&#xD;
      monopolar dielectric diathermy by emission of radiofrequency combined with 8 sessions of&#xD;
      supervised therapeutic exercise) or to the control group (8 sessions of supervised exercise).&#xD;
      The number of participants will be identical between the groups. The randomization sequence&#xD;
      will be performed by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants for each group will be 30. The results of the random assignment&#xD;
      will be sealed in opaque envelopes before being delivered to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome assessor and study statistician will be blinded throughout the entire process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline assessment of the primary and secondary outcome measures will be performed before&#xD;
      randomization of the participants to the different groups, an immediate post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment (1 day after the last intervention) and an assessment two months after the end of&#xD;
      the procedure. intervention (follow-up).&#xD;

    <description>The Experimental Group formed by 30 subjects will undergo an application of monopolar electrical diathermy by radiofrequency emission (MDR) using the Physicalm® device developed by the electro-medicine company Biotronic Advance Develops SL, on the lumbar musculature by means of rotary movements and translation, adapting to the muscle fibers of the lumbar area. A pulsed emission of 840 KHz and 30v will be made dynamically during a treatment time of 20 minutes. Once the application of (MDR) is finished, an exercise program supervised by a physiotherapist will be carried out. The exercise program will consist mainly of three types: stability and lumbo-pelvic motor control, strengthening and stretching of the lumbar muscles (Annex XIV), with a duration of 20 minutes. 2 weekly sessions will be held for 4 weeks, distributed as follows: Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday, a total of 8 treatment sessions.</description>
