  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether within- and between-patient effects of attachment moderate&#xD;
      the association between self-disclosure and psychotherapy outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are recruited at the University Clinic Heidelberg at the beginning of their&#xD;
      (usually) 8-week inpatient treatment. After informed consent, patients routinely fill out&#xD;
      weekly questionnaires on attachment, self-disclosure, and symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first to disentangle stable, trait-like (between-person) effects of both&#xD;
      attachment and self-disclosure from within-person changes over the course of treatment. The&#xD;
      study investigates whether (changes in) attachment moderate the association between (changes&#xD;
      in) self-disclosure and psychotherapy outcome.&#xD;
