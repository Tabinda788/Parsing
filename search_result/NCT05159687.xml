    <textblock>
      Project rationale: Vasovagal syncope (VVS) affects up to 50% of people, and recurrent syncope&#xD;
      markedly reduces quality of life. We recently reported that it is frequently associated with&#xD;
      injury and not surprisingly with clinical anxiety. Although conservative measures help many&#xD;
      patients there remain many who require more care. CIHR-funded studies have shown that&#xD;
      fludrocortisone and midodrine are effective but cannot be used in patients with&#xD;
      contraindications such as hypertension and heart failure. Pacemakers are partially effective&#xD;
      in older patients, but this is established only in the small minority with proven asystole.&#xD;
      There remains a need for a simple, once-daily medication with few contraindications that can&#xD;
      be used as first-line therapy for most patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies: Norepinephrine transport (NET) inhibitors show promise as a novel&#xD;
      treatment. Three (reboxetine, sibutramine, and atomoxetine) all prevent vasovagal syncope in&#xD;
      healthy subjects and vasovagal syncope patients on tilt tests. Atomoxetine, approved to treat&#xD;
      attention deficit disorder, is a highly selective NET inhibitor. We reported a&#xD;
      proof-of-principle, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of atomoxetine to&#xD;
      prevent vasovagal syncope on tilt table tests. Patients underwent tilt testing after&#xD;
      receiving either atomoxetine 40 mg or placebo. Fewer VVS patients fainted with atomoxetine&#xD;
      than placebo (10/29 vs. 19/27; odds ratio 0.22, p &lt; 0.01). Our meta-analysis of the effects&#xD;
      of NET inhibition on the vasovagal reflex induced by tilt tests was highly positive. A&#xD;
      pre-post study showed that sibutramine reduced syncope frequency in highly symptomatic and&#xD;
      drug-refractory patients. A similar pre-post study showed that atomoxetine also reduces&#xD;
      syncope frequency about 85% in patients with frequent and drug-intolerant or drug-resistant&#xD;
      vasovagal syncope. Therefore,NET inhibition by atomoxetine merits assessment based on&#xD;
      positive proof-of-principle studies, an apparent class effect, and two open-label pre-post&#xD;
      studies. These results provide the rationale for a formal randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      crossover trial of atomoxetine in moderate-to-high risk patients with VVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We will test the hypothesis that oral atomoxetine prevents syncope in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent VVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study: Patients will be included based on a positive Calgary Syncope Symptom Score and a&#xD;
      history of at least 2 faints in the previous year. Eligible patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      atomoxetine 40 mg po twice daily or matching placebo in a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel design, double-blind, crossover trial. Each arm will last 6 months with a 1-week&#xD;
      washout period. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of patients with at least&#xD;
      1 syncope recurrence. The study will be powered to detect a beneficial odds ratio of 0.5,&#xD;
      selected on the basis of the control outcome rates in 2 similarly designed, previous studies&#xD;
      and international expert requirements for effect size. A sample size of 180 subjects will&#xD;
      provide 85% power of detecting a difference between the arms at p&lt;0.05. We will assess the&#xD;
      effects of atomoxetine on quality of life, anxiety, injury, and the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      atomoxetine treatment, and the effects of genetic factors on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudies : The quality of life scales will be the SF-36 and the Euroqol EQ5D, which will&#xD;
      also be used as the health utility index for the economic studies. The depression and anxiety&#xD;
      scales will be the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Score (HADS) and the General Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder - 7 Score (GAD-7). Clinical anxiety is highly prevalent in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      syncope. Injury will be self-reported using our published definitions. The health economic&#xD;
      substudy will be from the health system perspective and will use Alberta administrative data.&#xD;
      DNA will be collected from spit acquired in the Oragene saliva self-collection kits, and an&#xD;
      initial candidate gene study might include alleles of CYP2D6, COMT, the serotonin (SLC6A4)&#xD;
      and norepinephrine (SLC6A2) reuptake transporters, and the 5HT1A and 5HT3 receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: Adults who faint recurrently are highly symptomatic. There are no therapies suitable&#xD;
      for most patients have withstood the test of randomized clinical trials. If successful,&#xD;
      atomoxetine will reduce syncope and improve quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>The total score is out of 42, (21 per subscale). Scores are derived by summing responses for each of the two subscales or for the scale as a whole Higher scores indicate greater levels of anxiety or depression. The total HADS score may be regarded as a global measure of psychological distress</description>

    <description>The GAD-7 is useful in primary care and mental health settings as a screening tool and symptom severity measure for the four most common anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder).&#xD;
It is 70-90% sensitive and 80-90% specific across disorders / cutoffs (see Evidence section for more).&#xD;
Higher GAD-7 scores correlate with disability and functional impairment (in measures such as work productivity and health care utilization)</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-3L</measure>
    <time_frame>every 6 months of the study up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L classification system consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, each with three levels: no problems &quot;1&quot;, moderate problems &quot;2&quot;, and severe problems &quot;3&quot;. Each health state is described as a vector of these five dimensions. With 3 levels for each dimension, the EQ-5D-3L describes 243 distinct health states, with 11111 being the best health state (full health), and 33333 the worst health state.&#xD;
In addition to the classification system, each of the instruments also includes a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100, whereby 0 indicates 'the worst health you can imagine', and 100 'the best health you can imagine'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

All questions are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning possible. Aggregate scores are compiled as a percentage of the total points possible, using the RAND scoring table</description>
