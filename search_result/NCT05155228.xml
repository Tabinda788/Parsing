      This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Attachment Regulation and Competency (ARC)&#xD;
      treatment framework in comparison to treatment as usual for reducing symptoms of PTSD and&#xD;
      Developmental Trauma Disorder among children ages 8 to 16 with a history of exposure to&#xD;
      multiple traumatic events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to expand the knowledge base in the field of trauma&#xD;
      informed interventions by addressing current gaps in the evidence base through: a) evaluation&#xD;
      of the efficacy of an innovative intervention designed specifically for children who&#xD;
      experience complex trauma and their caregivers, thereby evaluating strategies that are most&#xD;
      effective, and b) examining how ARC promotes protective factors (self-regulation, caregiver&#xD;
      wellness), thereby supporting the health and well-being of complexly traumatized children and&#xD;
      their families. The overall purpose of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of ARC on the range of developmental disruptions and clinical symptoms that&#xD;
      represent complex trauma, as well as its utility for increasing the adaptive functioning of&#xD;
      children and families. In particular it is necessary to determine: 1) if ARC will demonstrate&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing sequelae of complex trauma as determined by a scientifically&#xD;
      rigorous randomized control trial study design; 2) the extent to which ARC positively impacts&#xD;
      resiliency factors (self-regulation, executive functioning, caregiver wellness), thereby&#xD;
      serving to moderate or mediate change in symptoms and functioning; and 3) the impact of ARC&#xD;
      across multiple levels of the family ecology, including the child, the caregiver-child&#xD;
      relationship (i.e., attachment) and caregiver stress and wellness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this research project are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruit 182 children ages 8 to 16 with complex trauma and their adult caregivers, from&#xD;
           clinical samples of children actively seeking treatment for mental health disorders and&#xD;
           related difficulties from three community based outpatient clinics in the Commonwealth&#xD;
           of Massachusetts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct comprehensive, clinical interviews with participants and their caregivers to&#xD;
           assess sequelae of complex trauma, to determine underlying resiliency factors and to&#xD;
           gather information regarding trauma exposure history, over four study time points (pre-,&#xD;
           mid-, and post-treatment and 6-month follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Deliver 24 sessions of once weekly ARC or TAU over a 6-month intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the efficacy of ARC and TAU using a variety of sophisticated statistical&#xD;
           methods, such as growth curve modeling, multivariate analyses, and hierarchical linear&#xD;
           regression analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Disseminate findings to: 1) the academic community via presentations at professional&#xD;
           conferences and publications of data in peer reviewed journals; 2) the public, via the&#xD;
           Trauma Center website, which received over 600,000 visitors in 2012, with 1,161,451&#xD;
           downloads of our manuscripts and resources for providers, consumers and state service&#xD;
           agencies; and 3) the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) and Complex Trauma&#xD;
           Treatment Network (CTTN) at annual network meetings, via their websites and through&#xD;
           ongoing collaborations with partner network sites across the country.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Attachment, Regulation and Competency (ARC) Framework is an attachment focused model designed specifically for trauma-impacted children that incorporates principles of the following theoretical orientations: 1) developmental theory; 2) family systems theory; and 3) strengths-based approaches. The central goals of the ARC framework are to (a) support caregiving systems and enhance caregiver-child relationships (&quot;Attachment&quot;), (b) support children in developing the skills and tolerance for connecting to, identifying, and sharing internal experience and managing emotional and physiological states (&quot;Regulation&quot;), (c) build key capacities associated with resilience including the ability to engage in problem-solving and a positive / effective sense of self (&quot;Competency&quot;), and (d) process traumatic experiences.</intervention_model_description>
