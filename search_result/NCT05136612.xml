  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy is defined as the cause of movement and posture disorders and activity&#xD;
      limitation that develops in the fetal or infant brain that has not yet completed its&#xD;
      development. When the literature is examined, although upper extremity and lower extremity&#xD;
      involvements are common in individuals with hemiparetic CP, treatment programs are mostly&#xD;
      aimed at the lower extremities. However, studies report that the upper extremity is more&#xD;
      severely affected than the lower extremities in individuals with hemiparetic CP and that&#xD;
      upper extremity functions have an effect on walking. Although different treatment methods&#xD;
      have positive effects, their superiority over each other cannot be clearly reported. In this&#xD;
      case, new intervention strategies based on sound methodological and scientific foundations&#xD;
      are needed. At this point, virtual reality applications and robotic rehabilitation programs&#xD;
      have started to play an important role in CP rehabilitation along with current developments&#xD;
      in technology-assisted rehabilitation. Robotic devices provide visual, auditory and sensory&#xD;
      inputs, making the process fun, while making the individual active in the treatment. It also&#xD;
      enables the child to achieve goal-directed movements in children with motor disabilities.&#xD;
      Various gait problems are seen in individuals with CP. Therefore, although lower extremity&#xD;
      movements during walking have been well analyzed in the literature, upper extremity functions&#xD;
      and especially arm movements during walking have received less attention. Although human gait&#xD;
      is perceived as a situation that concerns only the lower extremities, it actually includes&#xD;
      the coordinated movements of all four extremities. Individuals with hemiplegic CP usually&#xD;
      have a markedly deviated arm position and reduced arm movement. This situation also affects&#xD;
      the gait and balance of individuals with hemiparetic CP. Individuals change their upper&#xD;
      extremity kinematics while increasing their walking speed to optimize gait and increase&#xD;
      balance. In the light of this information, practices aimed at improving upper extremity&#xD;
      movement and function should be included in the rehabilitation program of patients with&#xD;
      hemiparetic CP, considering a holistic approach. Considering all these, we thought that if we&#xD;
      increase the functions of the upper extremities, we can improve walking, and we planned this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy is defined as the cause of movement and posture disorders and activity&#xD;
      limitation that develops in the fetal or infant brain that has not yet completed its&#xD;
      development. Although CP is the most common physical disorder in childhood, its incidence&#xD;
      varies between 1.7-2 people per 1000 live births in developed countries. Although the&#xD;
      impairments seen in CP are not progressive, as individuals with CP get older, their current&#xD;
      motor function declines dramatically and their independence decreases or disappears as a&#xD;
      result. These neurodevelopmental disorders are classified as hemiplegic, diplegic and&#xD;
      quadriplegic according to the anatomically affected body parts. Along with motor damage,&#xD;
      epilepsy, cognitive disorders, behavioral disorders, visual-hearing losses and sensory&#xD;
      disorders can be seen in children with CP. In addition, upper extremity involvement is quite&#xD;
      common in individuals with CP. Although upper extremity and lower extremity involvement are&#xD;
      common in individuals with hemiparetic CP, treatment programs are mostly aimed at the lower&#xD;
      extremities. However, studies report that the upper extremity is more severely affected than&#xD;
      the lower extremities in individuals with hemiparetic CP and that upper extremity functions&#xD;
      have an effect on walking . Although human gait is perceived as a situation that concerns&#xD;
      only the lower extremities, it actually includes the coordinated movements of all four&#xD;
      extremities. In a study, it was reported that it is beneficial to encourage arm movements&#xD;
      during gait rehabilitation. It has been reported that although individuals with hemiparetic&#xD;
      CP gain walking skills, they lag behind their peers in terms of upper extremity functions.&#xD;
      This makes upper extremity rehabilitation important. There are various treatment modalities&#xD;
      aimed at eliminating upper extremity dysfunction and reducing activity limitations. These;&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental treatment approaches, orthoses, forced restrictive movement therapy,&#xD;
      virtual reality and robotic rehabilitation applications. Although the different treatment&#xD;
      methods have positive effects, their superiority to each other cannot be reported&#xD;
      definitively. In this case, new intervention strategies based on sound methodological and&#xD;
      scientific foundations are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of technology, the interest in robotic rehabilitation has also&#xD;
      increased. The first study examining upper extremity robotic rehabilitation in CP was&#xD;
      conducted in 2008. In this study, it was reported that robotic rehabilitation has positive&#xD;
      effects on upper extremity motor functions and the use of upper extremities in daily living&#xD;
      activities. In a thesis study conducted in our country, conventional physiotherapy and&#xD;
      robotic rehabilitation were compared and it was concluded that hand skills improved in both&#xD;
      groups, but the increase in the group receiving robotic rehabilitation was statistically&#xD;
      significant. In the literature review, it was seen that studies on upper extremity robotic&#xD;
      rehabilitation were few and their effects on gait parameters were not examined. In this&#xD;
      context, it is thought that in our study, the effects of upper extremity robotic&#xD;
      rehabilitation on upper extremity functions and gait parameters will be examined and it will&#xD;
      contribute to the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This study was conducted to examine the effects of upper extremity robotic&#xD;
      rehabilitation on upper extremity functions and gait parameters in individuals with&#xD;
      hemiparetic CP; It is a prospective, randomized controlled, single-blind study. The study&#xD;
      will be carried out in a single-blind manner, and the evaluator will not know which group the&#xD;
      individual is in. 30 individuals with spastic hemiparetic CP, aged between 6-18 years, will&#xD;
      be included in our study. The parents of each individual will be informed about the study and&#xD;
      will read and sign the consent form stating that they voluntarily participated in the study.&#xD;
