  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical trial results demonstrate that IVL can increase lumen area by emitting sonic&#xD;
      pressure waves, with less inflation pressure as compared to traditional angioplasty balloon&#xD;
      dilation and resulting in minimal trauma to the vessel. Therefore, the use of IVL prior to&#xD;
      placement of a stent for severely calcified femoral popliteal arteries may be associated with&#xD;
      more successful stent implants and better long-term patency, resulting in a decrease in&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. The investigator will evaluate the success by defining as lesion&#xD;
      stenosis less than 30% and no evidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Event including death or any&#xD;
      amputation of the index limb within 30 days of the procedure.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immediate and long term effectiveness of using&#xD;
      intravenous lithotripsy followed by the placement of a Supera stent for the treatment of&#xD;
      calcified femoral popliteal arteries. The use of IVL and Supera stent will be predetermined&#xD;
      by the investigator according to inclusion criteria and the need for treatment and stenting&#xD;
      combined, will be confirmed through the use of intravascular ultrasound and the investigators&#xD;
      judgment for best practice. Following enrollment and index procedure, the subject will be&#xD;
      followed prospectively for one year.&#xD;
