  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every day, doctors and nurses make hundreds of decisions about treatments - like when to&#xD;
      start or stop them, or how frequently to give them. Ideally, decisions are based on gold&#xD;
      standard evidence from Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, for many&#xD;
      treatments little or no evidence exists and clinicians must use knowledge and experience to&#xD;
      decide what is best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As clinicians are all different, this leads to random variation in how treatments are given&#xD;
      to patients. For example, magnesium is routinely given in intensive care to prevent abnormal&#xD;
      heart rhythms. There is little evidence supporting this, and clinicians vary in how they&#xD;
      administer magnesium. Traditional RCTs might be used to examine whether more magnesium is&#xD;
      better than less magnesium, but this method is inefficient and expensive for investigating&#xD;
      multiple comparative treatment questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials are becoming more efficient by using existing hospital computer systems to&#xD;
      run them. However, research teams continue to perform tasks like randomisation manually. For&#xD;
      questions like magnesium supplementation, which occur daily, this is labour intensive and&#xD;
      infeasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital computer systems also possess mechanisms for prompting and alerting clinicians for&#xD;
      particular decisions, reminding them of best practices, warning them of potential problems.&#xD;
      These systems may be modified to allow clinicians to randomise patients, under specific&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to assess whether modified computer prompts can be used to&#xD;
      highlight the magnesium supplementation decision to clinicians. They would prompt the&#xD;
      clinician to evaluate the uncertainty around giving or withholding magnesium in that&#xD;
      instance. If the clinician agrees the optimal decision is unclear, they can choose to&#xD;
      randomise the patient within a predetermined trial structure. If the clinician knows better,&#xD;
      they may override the prompt and continue with their preference. In both cases, the system&#xD;
      learns from the decision and the patient receives optimal care determined by their clinician.&#xD;

      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-centre, mixed methods, feasibility study, embedded within the Electronic Health&#xD;
      Record System (EHRS). The study will be conducted on critical care units within University&#xD;
      College London Hospitals NHS Trust and will involve patients undergoing elective major&#xD;
      surgery which necessitates postoperative admission to critical care. The study will be&#xD;
      pragmatic in nature, with minimal disruption to usual care pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility Phase - Simulation guided semi-structured interviews with clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention Phase - Deployment of electronic prompts to evaluate candidate clinical&#xD;
           question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow Up Phase - Patient and clinician semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronically delivered prompts provide a feasible method of delivering point-of-care&#xD;
      randomisation for the evaluation of routine treatments not amenable to investigation using&#xD;
      standard clinical trial designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Example Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liberal magnesium supplementation (serum concentration &lt; 1.0 mmol/L) is superior to a&#xD;
      restrictive supplementation strategy (serum concentration &lt; 0.75 mmol/L) for the prevention&#xD;
      of Atrial Fibrillation in a general critical care population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare Nudge and Preference electronic Point-Of-Care Randomisation (ePOCR)&#xD;
      prompts against their ability to generate compliance with randomised allocations to liberal&#xD;
      or restrictive magnesium supplementation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following postoperative admission to the critical care unit, participants will undergo&#xD;
      randomisation between Nudge or Preference prompts and Liberal or Restrictive magnesium&#xD;
      supplementation strategies. After the two randomisations steps are complete, both ePOCR&#xD;
      designs follow the same pathway for activation and deployment to the bedside nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the EHRS detects a new serum magnesium result has been received, the system will screen&#xD;
      the participant against exclusion criteria 1-5. Each new result triggers the same screening&#xD;
      process. If the participant is eligible to proceed, the prompt will activate and display to&#xD;
      the bedside nurse under two conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Accessing of the blood test results in the EHRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Accessing the supplemental magnesium prescription within the EHRS. Once the prompt has&#xD;
           displayed and been acknowledged by the bedside nurse, further activation will be&#xD;
           suppressed until a new serum magnesium result becomes available. This process will be&#xD;
           tested in silico prior to deployment to the live EHRS and the results of testing made&#xD;
           available as part of the study materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where additional supplementation is indicated by the prompt, the nurse retains control over&#xD;
      the dose and frequency of administration, as directed by the standardised prescription. All&#xD;
      other aspects of postoperative care remain as standard and directed by the clinical team.&#xD;

    <description>The acceptability of using electronic point of care randomisation prompts, for the investigation of routine comparative effectiveness research questions like the study example will be assessed using a program of semi-structured interviews. These interviews will be delivered to critical care clinicians who may interact with the prompts. Interview data will be evaluated using a thematic analysis approach to derive an assessment of overall acceptability.</description>

    <description>Critical care clinicians will be invited to express a preference for the design of electronic randomisation prompt having been introduced to both designs. This will be evaluated using a programme of semi-structured interviews which will include simulations of both prompt designs to aid recall. Preference will be asked directly and response displayed as proportion of clinicians preferring each design (Nudge or Preference).</description>

    <description>Patients will be invited to undertake a semi-structured interview designed to ascertain their thoughts and opinions on each type of consent model. In addition, the interview will invite patients to consider different hypothetical research questions and how acceptable they feel each method of obtaining consent is for each.
