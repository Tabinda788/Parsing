      to investigate the effect of cervical stability training on somatosensory evoked potential&#xD;
      and cervical spine in forward head posture&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of electronic tools is increasing in worldwide varieties and the attractiveness of&#xD;
      these tools lead to variety of groups of people, especially teenagers, using them for&#xD;
      prolonged period of time leading to increased musculoskeletal problems. Excessive use of&#xD;
      smartphones for long period of time can lead to decreased postural control and forward head&#xD;
      postur (FHP) as phone users maintain an abnormal alignment of the head and neck. The habit of&#xD;
      repetitive use of computers, TV, mobile phones, and video games and even back packs forces&#xD;
      the body to exhibit bad posture. The overall prevalence of FHP was reported to be 66% in&#xD;
      computer based workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cervical stability training play a major role in treatment of forward head posture so this&#xD;
      study will be conducted to investigate its role on craniovertebral angle, cervical range of&#xD;
      motion, pain intensity level, functional disability, neck flexor and extensor muscles&#xD;
      endurance, lordotic cervical curvature, somatosensory evoked potential in forward head&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
