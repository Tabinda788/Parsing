    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, single-center, exploratory study. A total of 20 patients were&#xD;
      enrolled. The patient was orally administered with 150 mg of ripretinib daily. The study is&#xD;
      expected to enroll the first patient in August 2021, last patient before March 30, 2023 and&#xD;
      end the trial in November 2023. Subjects will receive up to 6 cycles of treatment before&#xD;
      surgery, which will occur 1 week after the last dose of study drug. The subject requires&#xD;
      discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study due to disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity, or Investigator's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into 3 periods: screening period, treatment period (visit period)&#xD;
      and follow-up period. All subjects in the study were required to meet all inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the screening period did not exceed 28 days, and eligible subjects who&#xD;
      completed the screening tests and assessments entered the treatment period for study&#xD;
      treatment and visits as specified in the protocol. Thereafter, participants entered the&#xD;
      follow-up period. The safety follow-up period begins with 30 days of study treatment until 90&#xD;
      days after dosing, and subjects should receive telephone assessments every 30 days. After the&#xD;
      safety follow-up period, subjects entered the survival follow-up period. Survival follow-up&#xD;
      will be performed every 3 months until 1 year after treatment. Survival information and&#xD;
      subsequent treatment information can be collected by effective means such as telephone&#xD;
      follow-up. For subjects without radiographic evidence of disease progression, radiographic&#xD;
      assessments should continue to be performed at the frequency of efficacy evaluations&#xD;
      specified for this study.&#xD;
