  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western&#xD;
      world. Overall survival (OS) remains poor, with 50% estimated 5-year survival. In Italy,&#xD;
      current estimates indicate that in 2020 a number of 43.700 patients have been affected by&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, with an increasing of diagnosed cases in both men and women. It is clear&#xD;
      that it is worthwhile to investigate the evaluation of colorectal cancer which could reflect&#xD;
      a different spread of screening programs or be the effect of different timing in the start of&#xD;
      the programs themselves. To improve the overall survival of colorectal cancer patients,&#xD;
      robust biomarkers for screening and predicting disease recurrence could help identify&#xD;
      high-risk patients, facilitate a close patient follow-up, and decide appropriate treatment&#xD;
      regimens during the postoperative care. Colonoscopy remains the most efficient method for&#xD;
      detecting CRC, yet its general application in the setting of screening is limited due to the&#xD;
      uncomfortable experience and the high costs. accumulating studies have revealed the potential&#xD;
      of systemic inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, neutrophils,&#xD;
      platelets, and lymphocytes, and also biomarker combination ratios [(eg, CRP-albumin ratio&#xD;
      (CAR), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR)] as prognostic&#xD;
      biomarkers in different cancers, including CRC. Chronic inflammation affects all stages of&#xD;
      tumor development. Several studies have shown that various preoperative markers reflecting&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response, including NLR and CRP ratio, offer predictive potential for&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality in CRC patients. However, several issues require&#xD;
      addressing prior to the adoption of these inflammatory markers in the clinical practice for&#xD;
      CRC patients undergoing surgery: a) the combination of inflammatory factors that might be&#xD;
      best in predicting oncological outcomes in colorectal cancer patients remains unclear; b)&#xD;
      previous studies for systemic inflammatory markers have mainly interrogated their prognostic&#xD;
      potential for oncological outcomes but have not laid emphasis for evaluating their predictive&#xD;
      value for postoperative complications; c) there is a lack of consensus on the cut-off&#xD;
      thresholds used for each marker for determining mortality risk resulting from surgical and&#xD;
      oncological outcomes.&#xD;

        Patients suffering from colorectal cancer will be identified after endoscopy and screened&#xD;
        for inclusion into the study once referred to the colorectal surgeon. Patients will be&#xD;
        approached for possible recruitment following diagnosis and radiological staging, provided&#xD;
        they fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be provided with verbal and&#xD;
        written details. A verbal explanation of the trial will be provided by a medically&#xD;
        qualified member of the healthcare team for the patient to consider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who accept to participate in, will then be formally assessed for eligibility and&#xD;
        invited to provide informed, written consent for their participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A total of 100 patients will be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
