  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the good and bad effects of the combination of drugs called&#xD;
      cabozantinib and nivolumab in treating patients with melanoma or squamous cell head and neck&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced). Cabozantinib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial may&#xD;
      help doctors determine how quickly patients can be divided into groups based on biomarkers in&#xD;
      their tumors. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in the blood, other body fluids, or&#xD;
      in tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process or a sign of a condition or&#xD;
      disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a&#xD;
      disease or condition. The two biomarkers that this trial is studying are &quot;tumor mutational&#xD;
      burden&quot; and &quot;tumor inflammation signature.&quot; Another purpose of this trial is to help doctors&#xD;
      learn if cabozantinib and nivolumab shrink or stabilize the cancer, and whether patients&#xD;
      respond differently to the combination depending on the status of the biomarkers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of molecular characterization based on tumor mutation burden&#xD;
      (TMB) and gene expression profiling (GEP) (for Tumor Inflammation Score [TIS]) for upfront&#xD;
      participant stratification, as assessed by the proportion of participants with less than or&#xD;
      equal to a 21-day turnaround time for biopsy results in stage I of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the feasibility of molecular characterization based on TMB and GEP (for TIS)&#xD;
      for upfront stratification in the overall study (stage I and stage II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the efficacy by overall response rate (ORR - defined as confirmed and&#xD;
      unconfirmed partial responses plus complete responses) of cabozantinib S-malate&#xD;
      (cabozantinib) plus nivolumab in each disease cohort, both across and within tumor biomarker&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the difference in ORR in each disease cohort between tumor marker subgroups&#xD;
      separately for each disease cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess safety and tolerability of this treatment in these populations. III. To&#xD;
      estimate disease control rate (DCR) in participants receiving cabozantinib plus nivolumab in&#xD;
      each disease cohort, stratified by tumor biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in participants receiving cabozantinib plus&#xD;
      nivolumab in each disease cohort, stratified by tumor biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate overall survival (OS) in participants receiving cabozantinib plus nivolumab in&#xD;
      each disease cohort, stratified by tumor biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify candidate biomarkers predictive of response and toxicity to the cabozantinib&#xD;
      and nivolumab combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BANKING OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle and&#xD;
      cabozantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Cycles repeat every 28 days for 2 years in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed for up 3 years or death.&#xD;
