    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open label randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of original oral&#xD;
      care protocol for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and&#xD;
      ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT)in adult patients mechanically ventilated for at&#xD;
      least 3 days&#xD;

      The study aims to clarify the effect of of the original method of oral cavity care in adult&#xD;
      patients of intensive care units on long-term mechanical ventilation due to the assessment of&#xD;
      the microbiological landscape of the oral cavity, oral plaque, upper and lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract, the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-associated&#xD;
      tracheobronchitis (VAT) , depending on the traditional or original protocol of the oral&#xD;
      cavity care. Ventilator associated pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.Inadequate oral hygiene in intensive care units (ICUs) has been recognized as a&#xD;
      critical issue, for it is an important risk factor for ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP).&#xD;
      VAP is an aspiration pneumonia that occurs in mechanically ventilated patients, mostly caused&#xD;
      by bacteria colonizing the oral cavity and dental plaque. It has been suggested that&#xD;
      improvement of oral hygiene in ICU patients could lead to a reduced incidence of VAP.&#xD;
      Although diverse oral care measures for ICU patients have been proposed in the literature,&#xD;
      there is no evidence that could identify the most efficient ones. Although there are several&#xD;
      evidence-based protocols, oral care measures are still performed inconsistently and differ&#xD;
      greatly between individual ICUs.The influence of tooth brushing to maintain good oral health&#xD;
      in the general population has long been standard practice. However the effect of brushing in&#xD;
      the mechanically ventilated and intubated critically ill patients to dislodge organisms from&#xD;
      dental plaque remains largely unclear&#xD;
