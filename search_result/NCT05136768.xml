  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination of Sintilimab and SBRT on the basis of&#xD;
      platinum-containing chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of limited metastatic head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (LM-HNSCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with LM-HNSCC, the conventional first-line treatment is EXTREME regimen&#xD;
      dominated systemic therapy. In the recent era, immunotherapy has emerged to be the paramount&#xD;
      issue for cancer treatment. A series of high-quality clinical studies demonstrated that&#xD;
      immunotherapy (such as PD1 inhibitor) with or without chemotherapy (depending on CPS status)&#xD;
      offered significant survival benefits to patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC&#xD;
      and the toxicities were well tolerated, whereas the PFS was still dismal. SBRT is associated&#xD;
      with initiating release of tumor antigens, promoting DC activation, activating APCs, priming&#xD;
      CD8+ CTLs, leading to the potential of abscopal effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that&#xD;
      adding SBRT to Sintilimab (a PD1 inhibitor) and platinum-containing chemotherapy as the&#xD;
      first-line treatment may improve the PFS for limited metastatic head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (LM-HNSCC).&#xD;
