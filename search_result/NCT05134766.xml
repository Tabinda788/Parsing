      Retrospective analysis with subgroup evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives of the data analysis study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Retrospective analysis of the symptoms and quality of life data of patients with mild,&#xD;
      acute (&lt;96 hours) upper respiratory symptoms based on the results of standard health&#xD;
      assessment questionnaires used at the institution, over a period of 10-15 days after the SARS&#xD;
      CoV-2 PCR test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Retrospective assessment of the upper respiratory tract symptoms and quality of life and&#xD;
      serological parameters of the contact persons with confirmed close exposure to SARS CoV-2 PCR&#xD;
      positive patients (based on the results of the standard health assessment questionnaires used&#xD;
      at the institution in the period of 10-15 days after the SARS CoV-2 PCR test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective analysis also includes an assessment of the pharmacological and&#xD;
      supplementary therapies used in patients presenting with mild, acute (&lt;96 hours) upper&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms and SARS CoV-2 positive contacts, as well as the incidence of SARS CoV-2&#xD;
      virus infection in contacts confirmed by PCR test (based on values measured within 48 hours&#xD;
      and 10-15 days later), and an analysis of patients' serological data.&#xD;

      1. Symptoms and quality of life data of patients with mild, acute upper respiratory&#xD;
           symptoms in the stated period, as recorded in standard health assessment questionnaires&#xD;
           used at the institution. Symptoms and quality of life parameters recorded during the&#xD;
           course of acute mild upper respiratory disease based on the health assessment&#xD;
           questionnaires used at the institution and international standard upper respiratory&#xD;
           questionnaires (revised &quot; CMC Déli Klinika - Clinical Data, Health and Risk Assessment&#xD;
           Related to the SARS CoV-2 Tests&quot; questionnaire and the&#xD;
           WHO-protocol_2019-nCoV-Seroepidemiology-2020.1 and WURSS based on &quot;Wisconsin Upper&#xD;
           Respiratory Symptom Survey - WURSS-24 - Daily Symptom Report&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical laboratory data: Results of the SARS CoV-2 PCR and serological tests over a&#xD;
           15-day period. As an additional cohort, contact persons with close exposure, who were&#xD;
           asymptomatic or presenting with mild upper respiratory symptoms, in whose case the SARS&#xD;
           CoV-2 virus was detected by PCR within 48 hours and the proximity of SARS CoV-2 PCR&#xD;
           positive patients can be considered as potential exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted between 01 January 2021 to 30 June 2021, using data from patients&#xD;
      presenting at the CMC Déli Klinika. Data analysis for research purposes includes a critical&#xD;
      analysis of the results of the enrollment tests, the so-called (baseline data) laboratory&#xD;
      data and the results from the online (follow-up) symptom diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all persons presenting at the institution, it should be confirmed during the standard&#xD;
      consent procedure of the clinic that the CMC Déli Klinika conducting the data collection will&#xD;
      treat patient documents and data in strict confidence. In addition, all personal data,&#xD;
      especially sensitive data related to the health of the research participants, must be handled&#xD;
      in accordance with GDPR 2016/679 and all related local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection perod is 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021, using data from patients&#xD;
      presenting at the CMC Déli Klinika. Data analysis for research purposes includes a critical&#xD;
      analysis of the results of the enrollment tests, the so-called (baseline data) laboratory&#xD;
      data and the results from the online (follow-up) symptom diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the retrospective observational nature of the study, the analysis will be&#xD;
      descriptive/exploratory. Available data from all patients who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be included in the analysis. The subgroups will be analyzed in an exploratory way (e.g.&#xD;
      by age, gender, medications used and other supplementary therapies, and by relevant&#xD;
      subgroups). The analysis plan is to be developed at an analytical statistical meeting after&#xD;
      the primary analysis of the data for the period under review. One of the variables in the&#xD;
      study is the change in the revised WURSS-24 scale score on days 10-15 compared to the&#xD;
      baseline 2-day value, and its change in the 2-10 day period under review. The change will be&#xD;
      analyzed by descriptive statistical methods, there will be no formal hypothesis testing. The&#xD;
      results of the statistical tests performed will be interpreted descriptively. Continuous data&#xD;
      will be described by statistical estimates (mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum,&#xD;
      mode, median). Categorical data will be characterized by absolute frequency and percentage.&#xD;
      The parameters related to the research study objectives will be described descriptively, and&#xD;
      the time course and characteristic extreme values of each data set will be presented.&#xD;
      According to the applied treatment, the data will be compared by t-test in the case of two&#xD;
      groups and by ANOVA in the case of more than 2 groups. The change over time will also be&#xD;
      presented graphically. For the proportion of PCR-positive patients confirmed by standard&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure, the proportion of COVID-positive patients confirmed by PCR and&#xD;
      PCR-positive contact persons on days 10-15 and the related 95% confidence interval will be&#xD;
      determined. The ratios measured in each treatment subgroup will be compared by Chi-square&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quality of life questions used by the institution, the quality of life will be evaluated&#xD;
      on a QoL scale. The results of the questionnaires will be summarized separately for each&#xD;
      subgroup by time, using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, the number of&#xD;
      cases, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values will be presented. For&#xD;
      categorical variables, the case number and frequency will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of its healthcare services, the institution provides medical and health data&#xD;
      related to patients in accordance with the data protection standards, confidentiality and&#xD;
      local/regional/national requirements. All records and patient documents being kept&#xD;
      confidential. During the retrospective analysis, the data will be stored exclusively in a&#xD;
      coded form according to the institution's database, anonymously. In order to process the&#xD;
      data, they will be entered and checked by qualified staff in accordance with the daily&#xD;
      standard routine. The inspection of the clinical data of the retrospective survey will be&#xD;
      performed for the purpose of verification by a designated independent clinical research&#xD;
      specialist at the study site. The statistical evaluation of the data and the comparison of&#xD;
      the results of each subgroup will be carried out with the involvement and under the guidance&#xD;
      of a specialist statistician. Descriptive statistical methods, as well as the formation of&#xD;
      relevant subgroups for each parameter and the drug and supplementary therapies used to treat&#xD;
      symptoms, and comparative analysis of cohort data. Data will be analyzed anonymously,&#xD;
      aggregated and by subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institution conducting the research is responsible for submitting an application, in an&#xD;
      appropriate method and form, for the ethical authorization of the retrospective analytical&#xD;
      research. In accordance with the relevant rules of procedure, a copy of the submitted&#xD;
      documentation as well as the source data used and its database will be archived by the&#xD;
      principal investigator.&#xD;
