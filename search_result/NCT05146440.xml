      Phase Ib/II, multicohort, single arm, open-label, multicenter, international clinical trial,&#xD;
      with 6 cohorts (advanced STS, advanced L-sarcomas, other advanced sarcomas, advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors, and localized STS) with 4 sites in Spain for phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore different infusions of PM14 (longer or repeated) in order&#xD;
      to obtain a potentially better efficacy and similar toxicity profile in advanced soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma patients as monotherapy and also in other solid tumors as concomitant treatment with&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I dose-finding stage for PM14 is planned with an estimated number of 20-25 patients.&#xD;
      PM14 will be tested at different dose levels in 24-h IV infusion on day 1 of 21-day cycles,&#xD;
      up to progression or unacceptable toxicity. Premedication with dexamethasone is recommended&#xD;
      on the day before treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I dose-finding stage for PM14 is planned with an estimated number of 20-25 patients.&#xD;
      PM14 will be tested at different dose levels in 3-h IV infusion during 3 consecutive days&#xD;
      (days 1-3) of 21-day cycles, up to progression or unacceptable toxicity. Premedication with&#xD;
      dexamethasone is recommended on the day before treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort E&#xD;
&#xD;
      PM14 will be administered at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) according to the most&#xD;
      convenient scheme. Cycles will be administered by central venous port. Premedication with&#xD;
      dexamethasone is recommended on the day before treatment initiation. Cycles will be repeated&#xD;
      every 21 days up to progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort F&#xD;
&#xD;
      PM14 will be administered at the RP2D according to the most convenient scheme. Cycles will be&#xD;
      administered by central venous port. Premedication with dexamethasone is recommended on the&#xD;
      day before treatment initiation. Cycles will be repeated every 21 days up to progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: PM14 will be administered at the RP2D according to the most convenient scheme in&#xD;
      21-day cycles, at at different dose levels in combination with radiotherapy, up to&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cycles will be administered by central venous port.&#xD;
      Premedication with dexamethasone is recommended on the day before treatment initiation and&#xD;
      during 2 additional days (in the 24-hour infusion) and during 3 additional days (in the&#xD;
      3-hour infusion). Radiation therapy will start within 1 hour of PM14 infuser disconnection&#xD;
      and will be administered with 3 Gy per fraction for 10 days (30 Gy in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: PM14 will be administered at RP2D concomitant with radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort D&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: PM14 will be administered at the RP2D according to the most convenient scheme, in up&#xD;
      to 3 x 21-day cycles in neoadjuvant setting, at different dose levels in combination with&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Cycles will be administered by central venous port. Premedication with&#xD;
      dexamethasone is recommended on the day before treatment initiation. Radiation therapy will&#xD;
      start within 1 hour of PM14 infuser disconnection and will be administered with 1.8 Gy per&#xD;
      fraction for 25 days (45 Gy in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: PM14 will be administered at RP2D concomitant with radiation therapy.&#xD;

      Cohort A and B (Phase I, PM14 monotherapy, advanced STS): 20-25 patients approximately per&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort E (Phase II, PM14 monotherapy, advanced L-sarcomas): 28 patients; (Simon's two-stage&#xD;
      Minimax design), errors: α= 0.05; β=0.80, option related to efficacy = 35% (6-month PFSR)&#xD;
      (Sample size 15+13), success in 6-month PFSR of ≤ 15% will be considered as unacceptable&#xD;
      (H0), and would not warrant further investigation (null hypothesis). Success in 6-month PFSR&#xD;
      of ≥ 35% will be considered as an acceptable result warranting further investigation of the&#xD;
      investigational drug (H1, alternative hypothesis). A total of 15 eligible and treated&#xD;
      patients will be included in the first stage of the study. If ≤ 2 successes are observed, the&#xD;
      trial will be stopped in this cohort with the conclusion that the experimental treatment&#xD;
      should not be further investigated. Else (≥ 3 successes), patients will continue to be&#xD;
      accrued until 28 eligible patients enter the study. If 8 or more successes are observed in&#xD;
      those 28 patients, it will be concluded that the results of this trial warrant further&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort F (Phase II, PM14 monotherapy, other advanced sarcomas): 29 patients; (Simon's&#xD;
      two-stage Optimal design), errors: α= 0.05; β=0.80. option related to efficacy = 30% (6-month&#xD;
      PFSR) (Sample size 10+19), success in 6-month PFSR of ≤ 10% will be considered as&#xD;
      unacceptable (H0), and would not warrant further investigation (null hypothesis). Success in&#xD;
      6-month PFSR of ≥ 30% will be considered as an acceptable result warranting further&#xD;
      investigation of the investigational drug (H1, alternative hypothesis). A total of 10&#xD;
      eligible and treated patients will be included in the first stage of the study. If ≤ 1&#xD;
      successes are observed, the trial will be stopped in this cohort with the conclusion that the&#xD;
      experimental treatment should not be further investigated. Else (≥ 2 successes), patients&#xD;
      will continue to be accrued until 29 eligible patients enter the study. If 6 or more&#xD;
      successes are observed in those 29 patients, it will be concluded that the results of this&#xD;
      trial warrant further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C (Best scheme of PM14 plus RTP in advanced sarcoma, head &amp; neck, other solid tumors)&#xD;
&#xD;

      (2dose levels). 25 patients approximately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (advanced STS): errors: α=0.05; β=0.80, option related to efficacy = 50% (ORR in&#xD;
      irradiated nodules) (Sample size 9+15), success in ORR of ≤ 25 % will be considered as&#xD;
      unacceptable (H0), and would not warrant further investigation (null hypothesis). Success in&#xD;
      ORR of ≥ 50% will be considered as an acceptable result warranting further investigation of&#xD;
      the investigational drug (H1, alternative hypothesis). A total of 9 eligible and treated&#xD;
      patients will be included in the first stage of the study. If ≤ 2 successes are observed, the&#xD;
      trial will be stopped in this cohort with the conclusion that the investigational combination&#xD;
      should not be further investigated. Else (≥ 3 successes), patients will continue to be&#xD;
      accrued until 24 eligible patients enter the study. If 10 or more successes are observed in&#xD;
      those 24 patients, it will be concluded that the results of this trial warrant further&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort D (Best scheme of PM14 plus RTP in localized intermediate sarcoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (localized sarcoma): 2 dose levels, 10 patients approximate ly. Phase II (localized&#xD;
      &quot;intermediate risk&quot; STS): errors: α=0.05; β=0.80, option related to efficacy = 30% (ORR in&#xD;
      irradiated nodules) (Sample size 10+19), success in ORR of ≤ 10% will be considered as&#xD;
      unacceptable (H0), and would not warrant further investigation (null hypothesis). Success in&#xD;
      ORR of ≥ 30% will be considered as an acceptable result warranting further investigation of&#xD;
      the investigational drug (H1, alternative hypothesis). A total of 10 eligible and treated&#xD;

      should not be further investigated. Else (≥ 2 successes), patients will continue to be&#xD;
      accrued until 29 eligible patients enter the study. If 6 or more successes are observed in&#xD;

             conducted that is not part of routine patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age: 18-75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a diagnosis of advanced soft tissue sarcoma, or recurrent head &amp;&#xD;
             neck suitable for reirradiation or other advanced or metastatic solid tumor not&#xD;
             suitable for metastasectomy or surgery resection or not oncologically recommended&#xD;
             metastasectomy. A centralized diagnosis will be performed and the tumor sample must be&#xD;
             available and sent prior to inclusion to this end. For phase II part, onlysoft tissue&#xD;
             sarcomas will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have received a previous chemotherapy line in advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Disease distribution must allow meeting with normal tissue constrains of radiation&#xD;
             therapy. Radiation oncologist must confirm this point at local sites.&#xD;
&#xD;

             however, not all the locations have to be irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Those lesions considered for radiation therapy have to be related to symptoms (for&#xD;
             phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. It is allowed that not all the lesions will be under radiation fields. As a general&#xD;
             rule, the priority is to select, as target-irradiating lesions, those with greater&#xD;
             increase in size and those largest lesions if related with symptoms. Irradiating&#xD;
             pulmonary lesions with infiltration of pleural serosa is discouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Radiological disease progression must be documented within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient must have been considered eligible for systemic chemotherapy. A maximum of&#xD;
             two previous lines for advanced/metastatic disease are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The following histological subtypes can be included for the phase II part (central&#xD;
             pathology review is mandatory before accrual): undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma&#xD;
             (UPS), leiomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, epithelial hemangioendothelioma, liposarcoma and&#xD;
             its variants (well differentiated, dedifferentiated, myxoid/round cell, pleomorphic),&#xD;
             synovial sarcoma, fibrosarcoma and its variants (epithelial fibrosarcoma/low grade&#xD;
             fibromyxoid sarcoma), solitary fibrous tumor, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor&#xD;
             (MPNST), myxofibrosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma and (NOS) unclassified sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Performance status ≤1 (ECOG).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Adequate respiratory functions: FEV1 &gt; 1L; DLco &gt; 40% (patients with pulmonary target&#xD;
             lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;

             platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3). Patients withcreatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min (Cockcroft and&#xD;
             Gault's formula), transaminases ≤ 2.5 times the ULN, total bilirubin ≤ ULN are&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Men or women of childbearing potential must be using an effective method of&#xD;
             contraception before entry into the study and throughout the same and for 3 months&#xD;
             (men) and 6 months (women) after ending study treatment. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Normal cardiac function with a LVEF ≥ 50% by echocardiogram or MUGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. HBV and HCV serologies must be performed prior to inclusion. If HbsAg is positive it&#xD;
             is recommended to reject the existence of replicative phase (HbaAg+, DNA VHB+). If&#xD;
             these were positives the inclusion is not recommended, remaining at investigators'&#xD;
             discretion the preventive treatment with lamivudine. If a potential patient is&#xD;
             positive for anti-HCV antibodies, presence of the virus should be ruled out with a&#xD;
             qualitative PCR, or the patient should NOT be included in the study (if a qualitative&#xD;
             PCR cannot be performed then patient will not be able to enter the study).&#xD;
