    <textblock>
      This is a hybrid1, effectiveness-implementation study of yoga-based exercises (YE) as an&#xD;
      adjunctive tool for rehabilitation among persons with Severe Mental Illness (SMI). The&#xD;
      two-arm randomized controlled trial will compare the efficacy of YE compared to the Wellness&#xD;
      Lifestyle Program (WLP). Primary outcomes of the study will be self-report and&#xD;
      performance-based measures of community functioning, defined in the investigators study as&#xD;
      social, leisure, employment, and life skills functioning in the community. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include cognition and physical fitness measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine Yoga-based Exercise (YE) as a rehabilitation tool for Veterans with&#xD;
      Severe Mental Illness (SMI), defined as schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective disorder (SZA),&#xD;
      and Bipolar 1 disorder (BP1), with or without co-morbid history of alcohol use disorders&#xD;
      (AUD) or substance use disorders (SUD). The study will evaluate factors associated with&#xD;
      engagement in and uptake of YE among Veterans with SMI. This is a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      of YE that will examine factors that could facilitate or impede implementation of YE among&#xD;
      Veterans with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Adapt YE protocols for Veterans with SMI. The investigators will design and evaluate&#xD;
      adaptions of previously used Indian and US-based YE protocols in a non-religious context&#xD;
      (mindfulness, stretching, toning and breathing exercises). The investigators will consult&#xD;
      Indian and US colleagues, Veterans with SMI, and their VA therapists to adapt the protocol&#xD;
      for SMI population. The investigators will also adapt control condition, the Wellness&#xD;
      Lifestyle Program (WLP), from the recently completed RELIEVE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Study the efficacy of long-term YE among Veterans with SMI with a 2-armed RCT. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a 2-armed RCT in which consenting Veterans with SMI will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of 2 arms: YE and treatment as usual or WLP and treatment as usual.&#xD;
      Unlike prior short-term YE RCTs, the two arms will continue for 12 months, including an&#xD;
      initial 12-week training period consisting of two supervised sessions per week, followed by a&#xD;
      12-week training period consisting of one supervised session per week and monthly sessions&#xD;
      for the remaining 6 months. The investigators will compare the efficacy of YE versus WLP. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes are self-report and performance-based measures of community functioning.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are cognition and physical fitness measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Study factors associated with YE acceptance, adoption and implementation. The&#xD;
      investigators goal for Aim 3 is to understand demographic/clinical features of Veterans with&#xD;
      SMI who are more likely to accept and adopt YE to enable long-term rehabilitation, by&#xD;
      analysis of the RCT data (Aim3A). The investigators will also conduct qualitative interviews&#xD;
      with Veterans who have SMI and participated in the YE intervention arm, referring clinicians,&#xD;
      and the Yoga Instructor to identify barriers and facilitators for implementation (Aim 3b).&#xD;
