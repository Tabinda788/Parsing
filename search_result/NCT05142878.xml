  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers are a serious and common problem for residents admitted to long-term care&#xD;
      facilities and community care patients (National Pressure Ulcer Prevention Advisory Panel,&#xD;
      European Pressure Ulcer Prevention Advisory Panel, Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance,&#xD;
      2014). They represent a major burden to patients, carers and the healthcare system, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 1 in 20 community patients (Brown et al. 2016). They occur frequently among&#xD;
      patients with limited mobility, such as those patients being bed-bound and/or&#xD;
      wheelchair-bound. In many countries, pressure ulcers are recognized as a national health&#xD;
      issue and governments designate pressure ulcers as one of the most important sentinel events&#xD;
      for healthcare (De Meyer et al. 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      International guidelines recommend the use of pressure redistributing support surfaces,&#xD;
      systematic patient repositioning and preventive skin care to prevent pressure ulcers&#xD;
      (National Pressure Ulcer Prevention Advisory Panel, European Pressure Ulcer Prevention&#xD;
      Advisory Panel, Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance, 2014). All interventions should be&#xD;
      patient-tailored and based on a thorough assessment of both the patient and contextual risk&#xD;
      factors (Beeckman et al. 2013). As pressure ulcers can arise in a number of ways,&#xD;
      interventions for prevention and treatment need to be applied across a wide range of&#xD;
      settings, including the community, nursing homes and hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of mortality and severe harm incidents reported to the National Reporting and&#xD;
      Learning System (Brown et al. 2016) found that pressure ulcers were the largest proportion of&#xD;
      patient safety incidents in 2011/2012, accounting for 19% of all reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been acknowledged that a significant proportion of pressure ulcers are avoidable&#xD;
      (National Pressure Ulcer Prevention Advisory Panel, European Pressure Ulcer Prevention&#xD;
      Advisory Panel, Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance, 2014). The prevalence of pressure&#xD;
      ulcers is 1 of the 4 common harms recorded in the UK NHS Safety Thermometer, a local&#xD;
      improvement tool for measuring, monitoring and analysing patient harms across a range of&#xD;
      settings, including nursing homes, community nursing and hospitals on a monthly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous low levels or short-term high levels of pressure and shear on the skin and&#xD;
      underlying tissue on vulnerable areas are extrinsic factors contributing to the development&#xD;
      of pressure ulcers (Levi et al. 2014). Support surfaces (e.g. any mattresses, integrated bed&#xD;
      systems, mattress replacement, overlay, seat cushion, or seat cushion overlay) are&#xD;
      specialized devices for pressure redistribution specifically designed for management of&#xD;
      tissue loads, micro- climate, and/or therapeutic functions (NPAUP Support Surface Standards&#xD;
      Initiative S3I, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane systematic review by McInnes et al. (2015) defined multiple groups of pressure&#xD;
      redistribution materials: low-tech (not electrically driven) constant low-pressure supports,&#xD;
      high-tech supported surfaces, and other supported surfaces (operating table mattress pad,&#xD;
      rotating beds, cushions, and limb protectors). Static or reactive overlay mattresses are an&#xD;
      example of a low-tech constant low pressure support. Static air mattresses maintain a&#xD;
      continuous low air pressure that exerts a pressure redistributing effect. Serraes and&#xD;
      Beeckman (2016) found a pressure ulcer incidence of 5.1% in patients placed on static air&#xD;
      support surfaces (mattress overlay, heel wedge, and seat cushion) in a high risk population&#xD;
      in a nursing home setting in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial in 26 nursing homes (including 308&#xD;
      residents) between April 2017 and May 2018 resulted in a significantly lower pressure ulcer&#xD;
      incidence when applying the principle of static air (n=8/154, 5.2%) compared to the&#xD;
      alternating air group (n=18/154, 11.7%)(p=0.04). The median time to develop a pressure ulcer&#xD;
      category II-IV was significantly longer in the static air group (10.5 days, IQR 1-14)&#xD;
      compared to the alternating air group (5.4 days, IQR 1-12; p=0.05). The study concluded that&#xD;
      a static air mattress was significantly more effective compared to an alternating air&#xD;
      pressure mattress to prevent pressure ulcers in a high risk nursing home population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre cohort study will be performed in 5 nursing homes in a random sample of 40&#xD;
      residents who are at high risk of developing pressure ulcers. Residents will be included in&#xD;
      the study for a period of 14 days. Skin assessment and risk factor registration will be done&#xD;
      on a daily basis by the nurses. Reliability checks and time measurements will be completed by&#xD;
      the researcher.&#xD;
