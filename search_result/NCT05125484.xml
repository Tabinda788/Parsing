      The aim of this research is to compare the effects of Bowen's technique and Myofascial&#xD;
      Release technique on pain and disability in patients with trapezitis.Randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials done at Islamabad Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Centre(IPRC) and Benazir Bhutto&#xD;
      Hospital. The sample size was 66. The subjects were divided in two groups, 33 subjects in&#xD;
      Bowen's Technique group and 33 subjects in Myofascial Release Technique group. Study duration&#xD;
      was of 6 months. Sampling technique applied was non probability purposive sampling technique.&#xD;
      The patients aged 20-40 years and clinicaly diagnosed with Trapezitis(spasm,trigger&#xD;
      points,tenderness,stiffness) were included in the study. Tools used in the study are Cervical&#xD;
      ROMs, NPRS, NDI, Isometric Scapular Pinch Test and Lateral Scapular Slide Test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Trapezitis is a condition that involves inflammation of the trapezius muscle. The upper&#xD;
      fibers of trapezius, being the postural muscles, are highly susceptible to overuse injuries&#xD;
      and thus the inflammation.This results in pain that is present during the rest, is aggravated&#xD;
      with activity and is referred to the other areas. The pain results in protective spasm of the&#xD;
      antagonistic muscle group that also restricts the passive range of motion and makes it&#xD;
      painful too. In people working for long hours at a desk and computers or spending many hours&#xD;
      driving, the low level of upper trapezius activity is frequently found because of head&#xD;
      posture during sitting and standing , which is common cause of tension and neck pain in such&#xD;
      people.Various recent studies have hypothesized that trapezitis occurs due to muscle tissue&#xD;
      overloading and injury, that results in involuntary shortening of localized muscle fibers.&#xD;
      The stressed soft tissue area thus receives less glucose, oxygen and nutrients supply;&#xD;
      subsequently high levels of metabolic waste products are accumulated. And this cascade of&#xD;
      events ends in altered status of tissue, pain and the development of the Trigger points in&#xD;
      the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myofascial Release(MFR) is a soft tissue mobilization technique that is defined as &quot; the&#xD;
      facilitation of mechanical, neural and psycho physiological adaptive potential as interfaced&#xD;
      via the myofascial system&quot;.MFR decreases the pain and restores the proper alignment by&#xD;
      changing the ground substance's viscosity to more fluid state resulting in elimination of&#xD;
      excessive pressure of fascia on the pain sensitive structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is one more soft tissue technique called 'Bowen Technique' that is useful and indicated&#xD;
      in myofascial pain. The Bowen technique is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      '…dynamic system of muscle and connective tissue therapy which balances the body to allow it&#xD;
      to heal itself. The work consists of a series of precise moves on specific points of the&#xD;
      body. These moves are light and can be done through clothing. There are frequent and&#xD;
      important pauses between each series of moves giving the body time to benefit from each. The&#xD;
      technique uses positive moves that initiate a positive energy flow and negative moves that&#xD;
      isolate this energy to a specific area' (Rentsch and Rentsch,1997) The Bowen technique was&#xD;
      developed by late Tom Bowen in Geelong, Australia in 1950. It is a connective tissue&#xD;
      technique that uses subtle inputs called 'Bowen moves' to the body that stimulates the body's&#xD;
      self-healing. The Bowen moves applied are in several sets in a complete session of 15-45&#xD;
      minutes duration. While applying the technique, the therapist uses the thumb when the Bowen&#xD;
      move is executed away from the patient's body and two fingers are used when the Bowen move is&#xD;
      executed towards the patient's body. The technique can be used anywhere on the origin,&#xD;
      insertion or the belly of the muscle and produces a physical and an energetic action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique can be used to treat many types acute and chronic injuries and other health&#xD;
      issues. It does this by using holistic approach in which body's innate healing mechanism is&#xD;
      stimulated. This technique has been recommended in many conditions like headache, cervical&#xD;
      pain, back pain, whiplash injury, TMJ dysfunction, herniated disk, tennis elbow, hamstring&#xD;
      tightness and frozen shoulder, work related injuries etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An RCT was done by Ekta S. Chaudhary, Nehal Shah, Neeta Vyas, Ratan Khuman1, Dhara Chavda1,&#xD;
      Gopal Nambi that compared the effectiveness of MFR and cold pack in Upper trapezius Spasm and&#xD;
      concluded both MFR and cold pack along with exercises to be effective in upper trapezium&#xD;
      muscle spasm but the overall effects of MFR surpassed the cold therapy. Another study by&#xD;
      Pooja Mane , Amrutkuvar Pawar , Trupti Warude compared the effects of Myofascial Release&#xD;
      technique with Deep Friction Massage on pain and cervical ROM, the results concluded both&#xD;
      therapies to bring improvement in pain and cervical ROM but MFR was more effective.&#xD;
      Similarly, a systematic review of RCTs was conducted to determine the effectiveness of MFR in&#xD;
      decreasing pain , improving function and elongate length and concluded MFR to be emerging&#xD;
      strategy with strong evidence base and solid treatment option for many conditions. A study&#xD;
      was conducted to compare the effects of MFR with hot pack in reducing pain and improving&#xD;
      passive ROM in shoulder joint and that concluded both to be effective but MFR proved to be&#xD;
      more favorable because of the less time spent and no need of equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study has been done to see the effects of Bowen technique as an adjunct therapy to&#xD;
      conventional physiotherapy treatment on the pain and functional outcomes in patient with&#xD;
      Acute trapezitis and the results established Bowen technique to be effective in decreasing&#xD;
      pain and improving functional outcomes in Acute trapezitis.A few studies were conducted that&#xD;
      evaluated the effectiveness of Bowen technique in frozen shoulder and concluded this&#xD;
      technique as a positive intervention in improving mobility, functional status and decreasing&#xD;
      pain. A few studies were conducted that compared the effects of Bowen technique vs MET in&#xD;
      treatment of hamstring tightness.And few other worked to establish the effectiveness of Bowen&#xD;
      technique in different complex and common conditions and found positive results.A study was&#xD;
      done to show Bowen technique to be effective in health service workplace to improve physical&#xD;
      as well as mental well-being of the working staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the short term effects of Bowen Technique and MFR on pain and neck&#xD;
      disability in patients with trapezitis. Also it intends to study the short term effects of&#xD;
      both techniques on scapular motions. Bowen technique is a relatively new technique, having&#xD;
      easier application and has been less worked on. So, if this study proves the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Bowen technique in comparison with MFR in patient with trapezitis. Further studies can be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate its efficacy as an independent and preferable procedure in treatment of&#xD;
      other conditions and further work can be conducted on other areas as well. As this is a&#xD;
      holistic technique, so it could be a beneficial addition in the daily clinical practice.&#xD;
