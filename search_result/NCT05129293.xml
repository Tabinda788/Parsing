  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 70% of persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience cognitive impairment, which&#xD;
      can have a significant impact on several aspects of their daily lives. One cognitive domain&#xD;
      that has been shown to impact daily functioning, but is understudied in MS, is prospective&#xD;
      memory (PM). While there have been successful PM interventions in other clinical populations,&#xD;
      to date there has not been a specific PM intervention for PwMS that has been tested in a&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a double-masked randomized feasibility trial, with 18 participants&#xD;
      randomized to a PM intervention and 18 participants randomized to an active control&#xD;
      (psychoeducation). Participants will meet with an interventionist twice a week for four&#xD;
      weeks. Feasibility will be assessed via 1) recruitment, enrollment, and retention; 2)&#xD;
      adherence to the treatment; 3) treatment credibility and expectancy; and 4) treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction. A preliminary effect size (Cohen's d) will be computed for the group difference&#xD;
      using participants' performance on the Memory for Intentions Test, which will be given at&#xD;
      baseline (week 1) and post-treatment (week 6). Participants will also complete a battery of&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures as part of their baseline and post-treatment assessments.&#xD;
