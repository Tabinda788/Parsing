    <textblock>
      This study has 3 aims. Aim 1: Identify social determinants of cardiometabolic health and&#xD;
      determine facilitators and modifiable barriers in achieving treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess PLWH knowledge, skills, and confidence for self-management of cardiometabolic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Tailor a self-management support and education intervention with stakeholder input to&#xD;
      address barriers to achieving treatment goals for cardiometabolic disorders in PLWH at the&#xD;
      study sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: 20 PLWH ages 35 years and older with at least one cardiometabolic disorder&#xD;
      (hypertension, dyslipidemia, or type 2 diabetes) will participate in in-depth interviews&#xD;
      (IDIs) using photo elicitation to capture the social environment and contextual determinants&#xD;
      of cardiometabolic disorders for PLWH. Prior to IDIs, PLWH will take photographs of&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to reaching their cardiometabolic health goals. During IDIs we will&#xD;
      discuss the content of the photographs and explore the most salient facilitators and barriers&#xD;
      that an intervention (Aim 3) must address to achieve treatment goals for cardiometabolic&#xD;
      disorders at the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: 120 PLWH with the same eligibility criteria as Aim 1 across the study sites will&#xD;
      complete a Patient Activation Measure survey to assess knowledge, skills, and confidence for&#xD;
      self-management of their cardiometabolic disorders. Logistic regression models will assess&#xD;
      the predictors of knowledge, skills and confidence for self management of these disorders in&#xD;
      order to inform the tailoring of the intervention in Aim 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Guided by the Behavior Change Wheel model and using the human-centered design&#xD;
      approach, we will engage key stakeholders (healthcare providers, community advisory board&#xD;
      members, and PLWH with cardiometabolic disorders) in the tailoring of a self-management&#xD;
      support and education intervention that has been found to be effective in the general&#xD;
      population. We will engage stakeholders in an iterative process spanning three months by&#xD;
      first developing understanding of the self-management and education intervention, reviewing&#xD;
      the results from Aim 1 and 2 and brainstorming possible tailoring options within the context&#xD;
      in which PLWH live and receive care in order to arrive at an intervention that is desirable,&#xD;
      feasible, and viable. A final recommendation of the tailored intervention will be presented&#xD;
      to the participating HIV providers, Ending the HIV Epidemic Committee in Mecklenburg County,&#xD;
      and the Duke Center for AIDS Research Community Advisory Board. The completion of these aims&#xD;
      will provide the data for publication, an adapted evidence-based intervention, and community&#xD;
      and healthcare collaborations necessary to launch an R21 application to assess the&#xD;
      acceptability, fidelity, and appropriateness of the intervention.&#xD;
