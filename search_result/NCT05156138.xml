      The study aims to compare the endothelial cell count in patients with pseudoexfoliation&#xD;
      syndrome to the the endothelial cell count in normal patients above the age of 50.&#xD;

      Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is a systemic, age related condition, characterized by the&#xD;
      deposition of a basement membrane like material within the anterior segment of the eye, most&#xD;
      notably on the anterior lens capsule, the iris, the anterior chamber angle, and the anterior&#xD;
      vitreous. Both genetic and environmental factors may play a role in its pathogenesis . This&#xD;
      condition may present unilaterally or bilaterally and is known to be a major risk factor for&#xD;
      secondary open angle glaucoma. Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is seen in up to 50% of eyes with&#xD;
      pseudoexfoliation. In contrast to primary open angel glaucoma, this disease runs a more&#xD;
      aggressive clinical course with high intraocular pressure at onset, fast rate of progression,&#xD;
      poor the response to medical therapy is, as well as increased need for surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome demonstrates considerable geographic, ethnic and&#xD;
      racial variation, ranging from low rates (&lt; 6% in patients older than 70 years) to higher&#xD;
      rates (more than 15%) in other regions. In Egypt, the reported incidence of&#xD;
      pseudo-exfoliation syndrome in the population older than 40 years of age is 4.14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown the influence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome on the corneal&#xD;
      endothelium cell density (ECD). Multiple studies showed decreased ECDs of patients with&#xD;
      pseudoexfoliation syndrome compared to control patients. However, since the pseudoexfoliation&#xD;
      syndrome varies greatly between different populations, in terms of prevalence and&#xD;
      progression, it is valuable to study the potential corneal endothelial cell changes in an&#xD;
      Egyptian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that can change corneal density include Age, race, history of intraocular surgery,&#xD;
      use of contact lenses and endothelial dystrophies. That's why in this study, history of&#xD;
      intraocular surgery, corneal endothelial dystrophies and contact lens use are among exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and includes patients 50 years in age or older.A low endothelial cell count may be a&#xD;
      risk in cataract surgery if needed.&#xD;
