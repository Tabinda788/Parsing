  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) have been shown to increase length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      mortality. Infections acquired during a hospital stay have been shown to be preventable. The&#xD;
      skin of patients is considered a major reservoir for pathogens associated with&#xD;
      hospital-acquired infections, and has been suggested as a potential target for interventions&#xD;
      to reduce bacterial burden and subsequent risk of infection. The use of daily Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      (CHG) bathing in intensive care patients has been advocated to reduce many of the infections&#xD;
      in critically ill patients. However, the effectiveness of CHG bathing to reduce ICU&#xD;
      infections has varied considerably among published trials, making the effectiveness of CHG&#xD;
      bathing in ICU patients uncertain.&#xD;
