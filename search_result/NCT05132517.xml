  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments such as memory impairments, word-finding difficulties, compromised&#xD;
      orientation and perception are often observed in stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low serum-mg-concentrations are associated with cognitive impairments in ischemic stroke&#xD;
      patients one month after stroke onset. It is not clear, if cognitive impairments after stroke&#xD;
      is caused by the mg-deficiency or by the stroke itself. Until now, no studies investigating&#xD;
      the relationship between mg-concentration, stroke severity and cognition during treatment&#xD;
      course are available. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between&#xD;
      mg-concentration and cognition of stroke patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients admitted to the stroke unit will be included. Initial mg-concentration in&#xD;
      serum as well as stroke related measures (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale,&#xD;
      Scandinavian Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Scale) will be ealuated. Moreover, the cognitive&#xD;
      abilities of the patient will be assessed within the first three days via the Kölner&#xD;
      Neuropsychologische Screening for stroke patients as well as the Mini Mental Status Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During stroke rehabilitation mg-level, stroke related measures (NIHSS,SSS,MRS) as well as the&#xD;
      cognitive tests (MMST,KöpSS) will be re-assed after 4 weeks, 3 month as well as at study end,&#xD;
      which is defined as discharge from the clinic (death, transfer to another hospital without&#xD;
      return after 4 weeks, discharge to long-term nursing/ home/hospice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention-network of stroke patients are measeared if the patient undergo a MRi scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study following questions will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the incidence of cognitive impairments in stroke patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Are there differences between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Are there age and/or gender differences?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there differences regarding the mg-concentration at admission in comparison to the&#xD;
           follow-up (week 4 after admission, 3 month after admission) and between patients&#xD;
           with/without cognitive impairments?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a correlation between the mg-concentration and the stroke severity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is there a correlation between the scores of the different cognitive tests (MMST and&#xD;
           KöpSS)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is there an association between the stroke severity, the cognitive impairments (KöpSS)&#xD;
           and the neuronal attention network?&#xD;

    <description>The cognitive state of the patient is measure by the Kölner Neuropsychologische Screening (KöpSS) and by the Mini Mental Status Test (MMST). The MMST is a popular often used test, which makes comparisons to other international studies possible. However, even though this test was specifically designed for stroke patients, it has a limited sensibility. Thus the KöpSS is being used as an additional test demonstrating satisfactory sensibility and specificity. It is suitable for acute and subacute strokes and covers all stroke relevant domains.</description>
