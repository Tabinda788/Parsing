      The C Scope Visualization System Prospective Study is a post-market, single-arm, prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter study conducted in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance and safety of the C Scope&#xD;
      Visualization System in the illumination and visualization of joints from diagnostic&#xD;
      procedure through 1-week and 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
