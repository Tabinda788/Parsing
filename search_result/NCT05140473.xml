  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants of the perceived workload of&#xD;
      intensive care and pediatric continuous monitoring nurses (factors liked to the care service,&#xD;
      staff, patients treated)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care and pediatric continuous monitoring unit (RSCP), the workload of nurses&#xD;
      (registered nurses) is high. It is important to distribute the workload correctly among&#xD;
      caregivers in order to guarantee the quality and safety of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workload can be measured by different means. The measure of the perceived workload has the&#xD;
      advantage of taking into account not only the acts and care performed, but also the time&#xD;
      pressure felt, the feeling of having been efficient in its task, the efforts made and the&#xD;
      level of frustration felt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring the workload of RSCP registered nurses will help highlight the factors that may&#xD;
      influence the workload. The aim is to allow an adequate distribution of patients between&#xD;
      nurses, taking into account the determinants identified during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective : Measure RSCP's nurses workload&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Highlight the determinants of the overall perceived workload of RSCP&#xD;
      nurses (organizational characteristics, of the individual, of the patient and of his&#xD;
      entourage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highlight the determinants of each dimension of the perceived workload of RSCP nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calendar of data collection days will be defined by drawing lots. The day drawn for data&#xD;
      collection will proceed normally, with no change in practice for nurses. A study investigator&#xD;
      will inform the legal representative (s) of the possible data collection in their child that&#xD;
      day and will trace their non-opposition in the medical file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the day, registered nurses should collect data relating to family circles and&#xD;
      individual characteristics. In addition, nurses must complete a NASA TLX grid for each&#xD;
      patient treated during their working time. The grids will be assembled at the end of the day&#xD;
      (around 7 p.m.) and handed over to an investigator. The same procedure will apply to the&#xD;
      night shift, the grids will be handed over at 7 a.m. to an investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following days, the principal investigator will collect the data related to the&#xD;
      organizational characteristics and characteristics of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perceived workload of nurses working in Intensive care and Continuous Monitoring Unit&#xD;
      will be measured for each nurse who has at least 1 patient in charge during a period of 24&#xD;
      hours over 2 days (a day service and a night service, i.e. from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m. / D + 1 ),&#xD;
      once a month for a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement periods will be drawn at the rate of a period of 24 hours per month for one&#xD;
      year, ie 12 periods in total.&#xD;
