  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental oxygen is frequently administered in acutely and critically ill patients,&#xD;
      specifically, it is often administered in trauma patients to avoid arterial hypoxemia and&#xD;
      tissue hypoxia. There is also an increasing focus on potentially deleterious effects of&#xD;
      hyperoxia. Further, the hemodynamic response to hyperoxia in hypovolemia is poorly&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to investigate the effects of supplemental oxygen on systemic and&#xD;
      cerebral hemodynamics in simulated hypovolemia in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overriding goal for the resuscitation of any critically ill patient is to ensure adequate&#xD;
      oxygen delivery. In critically ill patients, SaO2 and PaO2 may be reduced due to lung&#xD;
      dysfunction (e.g. atelectasis and shunt flow). Under normal circumstances, SaO2 is near to&#xD;
      100%, and supplemental oxygen can not increase this further. Thus, in this circumstance,&#xD;
      providing supplemental oxygen will only increase a small, dissolved proportion. Although this&#xD;
      proportion may be a significant fraction in some circumstances, the intention of giving&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen is in most circumstances to ensure a high SaO2. Supplemental oxygen has&#xD;
      been extensively used in acutely critically ill patients to avoid hypoxemia, and is&#xD;
      recommended in severely injured trauma patients, as given by the statement: &quot;Supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen must be administered to all severely injured trauma patients.&quot; in the ATLS (Advanced&#xD;
      Trauma Life Support) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, supplemental oxygen is often given to trauma patients, often resulting in&#xD;
      hyperoxia. The clinical evidence for providing supplemental oxygen in all trauma patients is&#xD;
      however scarce. The liberal use of supplemental oxygen has also largely been founded on a&#xD;
      perception that supplemental oxygen is harmless, and that it is safer to err on the side of&#xD;
      hyperoxia. There is however an increasing focus on possible deleterious effects of hyperoxia,&#xD;
      especially in specific clinical circumstances. This has led to recommendations of more&#xD;
      restrictive use of supplemental oxygen, often titrated to no more than what is necessary to&#xD;
      achieve an adequate arterial oxygen saturation (e.g. in the range 94-98%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial treatment of trauma patients, detection and treatment of hypovolemia is of&#xD;
      paramount importance. Hypovolemia leads to reduced cardiac filling and stroke volume. Under&#xD;
      normal circumstances in unanesthetized humans, this is compensated by an increase in systemic&#xD;
      vascular resistance and heart rate to maintain a normal or near-normal mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP). At some point, these compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, and MAP typically falls&#xD;
      abruptly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is a model of central hypovolemia where negative pressure&#xD;
      is applied to the body from the waist-down. Thereby, blood is displaced from the central&#xD;
      compartment of the upper body to the lower extremities and pelvis. The model has been used&#xD;
      for more than half a century and is considered useful model for studying hypovolemia in&#xD;
      conscious volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normobaric hyperoxia induces vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow to several organs,&#xD;
      including the brain, heart and skeletal muscle. One could therefore hypothesize hyperoxia&#xD;
      leading to both an increased tolerance to hypovolemia mediated by vasoconstriction as well as&#xD;
      a reduced tolerance mediated by reduced cerebral blood flow. One study using the LBNP-model&#xD;
      did not find that supplemental oxygen significantly affected the hemodynamic response to&#xD;
      simulated hypovolemia. This study did however only apply one level of LBNP and did not&#xD;
      specifically study cerebral circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above, there is a need for studies on the effects of normobaric hyperoxia on the&#xD;
      hemodynamic response to hypovolemia. In the present study, we will study the effect of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen in the LBNP-model of hypovolemia in a crossover study on healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, 15 healthy volunteers will be exposed to LBNP with oxygen or room air&#xD;
      in randomized order in a crossover fashion. We will measure cardiac outout, stroke volume and&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery blood velocity to explore effects of oxygen on these variables during&#xD;
      hypovolemia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must be 18 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant must be under 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including&#xD;
             medical history, heart and lung auscultation, focused cardiac ultrasound and&#xD;
             measurement of cardiac conduction times.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Sex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the&#xD;
             methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Male participants: Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Female participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Use of adequate birth control for women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following&#xD;
                  menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile when&#xD;
                  sexually active. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no&#xD;
                  menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle&#xD;
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to&#xD;
                  confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or&#xD;
                  hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea,&#xD;
                  a single FSH measurement is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inclusion of WOCBP is possible when either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Using at least an acceptable effective contraceptive measure (combined&#xD;
                       (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception,&#xD;
                       progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
                       ovulation, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system,&#xD;
                       bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomised partner or sexual abstinence). As a&#xD;
                       minimum contraception should be maintained until treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             or&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Confirmed negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test at screening. A&#xD;
             pregnancy test is performed at any visit before administering IMP if more than 14 days&#xD;
             have passed since last pregnancy test. There will be no demand for post-intervention&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1 which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form&#xD;
             (ICF) and in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Breastfeeding.&#xD;
