      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Understanding the gut microbiome profile in very low birth weight infants with or&#xD;
           without ROP. The onset and aggravation of ROP and their relationship with gut microbiome&#xD;
           will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understanding the serum inflammatory cytokine profile in these infants and its&#xD;
           relationship with the onset and progression of ROP. Their changes and association with&#xD;
           the other systemic disorders such as NEC or RDS or sepsis will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examiningthe associations amongmicrobiome profile and serum inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
           their relationship with ROP clinical features (prematurity without ROP, ROP without&#xD;
           treatment, and ROP with treatment) in the study participant&#xD;

      Background In recent decades, severeretinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and the proportion of&#xD;
      ROP needing treatment is increasing. These conditions are due to the fact that more premature&#xD;
      infants now could surviveowing to the improvement in neonatology. Since ROP isa leading cause&#xD;
      of blindness in children, how to deal with these severely affected eyes becomes a major&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, growing evidence support that exposure to infection and inflammation&#xD;
      increases risk of ROP and these exposures are considered key contributors to the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of ROP. These exposures, which are modifiable, have gained interest among researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiome are symbiotic organisms living inside human bodies. They are most abundant in&#xD;
      human gastrointestinal tracts and play a fundamental role in host inflammatory and immunity&#xD;
      physiology. The gut microbiome is most extensively studied, and reports showed that they play&#xD;
      a role not only in gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases, but also in extra-gastrointestinal&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data have shown that microbiome changes may involve in the pathogenesisof ophthalmic&#xD;
      diseasessuch as uveitis, but its role in ROP has not been explored. Since ROP is closely&#xD;
      related to inflammation, and that the gut microbiome has a significant role in the modulation&#xD;
      of both systemic and ocular inflammatory pathways, we are interested to know whether there is&#xD;
      association between ROP, microbiome, and systemic inflammation. Whether the microbiome&#xD;
      profile is different in ROP and no-ROP neonates is worth exploring. Also, it is important to&#xD;
      see whether the onset of ROP is related to the systemic inflammation status. To the best of&#xD;
      our knowledge, there are no report on such topic, therefore our current study is designed to&#xD;
      answer this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Very low birth weight preterm infantsborn in our hospital from August 2020to July&#xD;
      2023 will be enrolled into study. Infants who has major or congenital GI anomaly will be&#xD;
      excluded. ROP screening protocol and categorization will follow the international standards.&#xD;
      DNA will be extracted from the stool samples and underwent microbiome profiling either by 16S&#xD;
      rRNA or shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Blood samples from the routine blood examinations&#xD;
      will beanalyzed by an immunoassay to reveal the level of systemic inflammation (IL-1&#xD;
      alpha/beta, IL-10, IL-13 and so on). Statistical analysis will be performed and the&#xD;
      associations among ROP features, gut microbiome, and serum inflammatory cytokines will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
