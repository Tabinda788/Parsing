  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dance for Parkinson's Disease® (DfPD®) is a structured dance program that has never been&#xD;
      evaluated in Greek PD population. This study assesses for the first time the efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of DfPD® program in Greek PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 16 early-to-mid-stage PD patients underwent a total of 16 60-min classes of&#xD;
      adjusted to Greek music and dance culture DfPD®, twice weekly, over 8 weeks. Assessments were&#xD;
      performed at baseline and at the end of the study period and included quality of life,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, fatigue, cognitive functions, balance and body mass index. Safety and&#xD;
      feasibility were also assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is an idiopathic, neurodegenerative, and progressive movement&#xD;
      disorder caused mainly by dysfunction of dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra. Numerous&#xD;
      studies demonstrate the benefits of regular physical exercise in PD, with aerobic exercise&#xD;
      having a greater neuroprotective effect by stimulating brain neuroplasticity. People with PD&#xD;
      are more easily motivated to attend dance classes systematically than other forms of&#xD;
      exercise, they have a high compliance rate with low dropouts, and often continue to practice&#xD;
      dance outside the dance intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DfPD® (Dance for Parkinson's Disease®, or Dance for PD®) was developed by the Brooklyn&#xD;
      Parkinson Group (BPG) in collaboration with the Mark Morris Dance Group (MMDG) in 2001.This&#xD;
      intervention has previously been shown to exert beneficial effect on QoL, motor functions,&#xD;
      cognition, self-efficacy, anxiety and depression in people with PD. To the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no study investigating the effect of any structured dance program in&#xD;
      Greek PD patients. Furthermore, no study to date has investigated the effect of DfPD® on PD&#xD;
      patients' fatigue. The present pilot study aimed at evaluating for the first time the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and feasibility of a culturally adjusted DfPD® program in Greek patients&#xD;
      with early-to-mid-stage PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open-label, pilot study. A total of 16&#xD;
      early-to-mid-stage PD patients underwent a total of 16 60-min classes of adjusted to Greek&#xD;
      music and dance culture DfPD®, twice weekly, over 8 weeks. Assessments were performed at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of the study period and included quality of life, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, fatigue, cognitive functions, balance and body mass index. Safety and feasibility&#xD;
      were also assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Dance for PD® was developed by the Brooklyn Parkinson Group (BPG) in collaboration with the Mark Morris Dance Group (MMDG) in 2001. It was designed to introduce people with PD to techniques used by dancers to control movement and it integrates different dance genres while participants dance individually and in groups rather than partnered.</description>
