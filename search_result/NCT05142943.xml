  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60% of people with a spinal cord injury have an incomplete injury. This causes&#xD;
      alterations in strength, sensitivity and muscle tone, which leads to a marked loss of&#xD;
      functionality. This supposes a profound psychological and socioeconomic impact on the life of&#xD;
      the affected person, in addition to the implicit physical impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an injury of this type, there is a spontaneous functional recovery that may have a&#xD;
      different path depending on the characteristics of the injury and the person. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that the neuroplasticity of the residual corticospinal fibers, the motor&#xD;
      cortex and the spinal neurons plays an important role in the spontaneous functional recovery&#xD;
      of people with neurological or musculoskeletal pathology. However, it is also possible to&#xD;
      stimulate the neuroplasticity mechanisms of these structures through techniques aimed at&#xD;
      rehabilitating different deficits (for example, motor function or sensitivity). In general,&#xD;
      intervention programs are usually carried out, in most cases, using low-cost strategies such&#xD;
      as therapeutic physical exercise programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of visual illusion therapies in&#xD;
      combination with conventional exercises on the symptoms and signs related to different&#xD;
      pathologies of the nervous and musculoskeletal system that affect the upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria will be the following: i. spinal cord injury with AIS C, D or E, ii.&#xD;
      ability to understand instructions (Mini-Mental State Examination&gt; 23 points). The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be the following: i. traumatic pathology in upper limbs, ii. other alterations&#xD;
      of the central nervous system or peripheral, iii. alterations in the vestibular system and&#xD;
      iv. concomitant diseases. The participants will be divided into the four groups described&#xD;
      above randomly using a computer program. Compliance with the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      verified by the physiotherapists specializing in the pathologies understudy at the Faculty of&#xD;
      Physiotherapy (Universitat de Val√®ncia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include the realization of three measurements that will be carried out one day&#xD;
      before starting the program, one day after finishing it, and one month later (follow-up).&#xD;
      These will be carried out by team members who are blind to the assignment of the&#xD;
      interventions. In the first evaluation, anthropometric and demographic data (i.e. height,&#xD;
      weight, age, educational level, possible comorbidities, etc.) will be collected in order to&#xD;
      control, in case of heterogeneity, these confounding variables. The clinical assessment will&#xD;
      be composed of the study of the following variables: Motor function and motor skills, Upper&#xD;
      limb isometric force, Muscle activation, Muscle tone, Quality of life, Functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis will be carried out using the SPSS statistical program (version 26). The&#xD;
      normality of the sample will be analyzed using the Shapiro Wilk test and homoscedasticity&#xD;
      using the Levene test. For the comparison between groups, a mixed factorial ANOVA will be&#xD;
      used, and for the comparison between pairs of groups the Bonferroni correction will be used.&#xD;
      In the event that there may be a confounding factor that meets the requirements to be&#xD;
      analyzed as a covariate, an ANCOVA will be used. Statistically significant differences will&#xD;
      be assumed when the p-value is less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interventions will last eight weeks and will be planned according to the availability of&#xD;
      volunteers. In each session, it will be recorded if any type of adverse effect occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four types of interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Visual Illusion (IV) and therapeutic exercise program (PE): the patient will be seated in&#xD;
      a chair with a table in front of it. The front part of the trunk will be covered with a black&#xD;
      blanket that will be attached to the table. On the table, you will see arms and hands&#xD;
      projected performing different types of functional manual activities that will include&#xD;
      mobility and strength tasks. The projected arms will be adapted to the dimensions of each&#xD;
      subject so that the patient can recognize the projected arms as theirs. This program will&#xD;
      last 10 minutes. Then a physical exercise program for the upper extremities will be carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. IV placebo and PE: the configuration of the work table will be the same as in real IV,&#xD;
      although videos of landscapes will be projected on them without any type of human or animal&#xD;
      movement appearing on them. This program will last 10 minutes. Afterward, a physical exercise&#xD;
      program for the upper extremities will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. IV: only the visual illusion program will be carried out.i. iv. IV placebo: only the&#xD;
      placebo visual illusion program will be carried out.&#xD;

      Approximately 60% of people with a spinal cord injury have an incomplete injury. This causes&#xD;
      alterations in strength, sensitivity and muscle tone, which leads to a marked loss of&#xD;
      functionality. This supposes a profound psychological and socioeconomic impact on the life of&#xD;
      the affected person, in addition to the implicit physical impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an injury of this type, there is a spontaneous functional recovery that may have a&#xD;
      different path depending on the characteristics of the injury and the person. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that the neuroplasticity of the residual corticospinal fibers, the motor&#xD;
      cortex and the spinal neurons plays an important role in the spontaneous functional recovery&#xD;
      of people with neurological or musculoskeletal pathology. However, it is also possible to&#xD;
      stimulate the neuroplasticity mechanisms of these structures through techniques aimed at&#xD;
      rehabilitating different deficits (for example, motor function or sensitivity). In general,&#xD;
      intervention programs are usually carried out, in most cases, using low-cost strategies such&#xD;
      as therapeutic physical exercise programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This nervous reorganization and recovery can also be influenced by the activity of mirror&#xD;
      neurons, which are found in motor and premotor areas and also in other cortical and&#xD;
      subcortical areas; and they report activation when they observe an action with a specific&#xD;
      purpose. The activity of these neurons has been studied in different populations with&#xD;
      involvement of the nervous and musculoskeletal system, such as cerebrovascular accidents,&#xD;
      head injuries, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's or carpal tunnel syndrome. For its study,&#xD;
      experimental investigations have been carried out applying different interventions that&#xD;
      modify the activity of mirror neurons, such as mirror therapy, virtual reality therapies or&#xD;
      Action-Observation therapies. Of these, in general, promising results have been obtained in&#xD;
      all these populations, except in the case of Alzheimer's disease in advanced stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these treatments have not been investigated in the recovery of the upper limb in&#xD;
      people with incomplete spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the above, the objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of visual&#xD;
      illusion therapies in combination with conventional exercises on the symptoms and signs&#xD;
      related to different pathologies of the nervous and musculoskeletal system that affect the&#xD;
      upper limb. Specifically, it is intended to know the impact of visual illusion therapy on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The motor function of the arm and hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The functionality .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The isometric strength of the upper extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle tone, rigidity and elasticity of the muscles of the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fine motor skills of the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The upper limb functionality. Therefore, this study aims to provide knowledge to the&#xD;
           scientific community on how neuroplasticity mechanisms and specifically mirror neurons&#xD;
           can influence the rehabilitation of people with incomplete spinal cord injury and, in&#xD;
           addition, propose a specific treatment methodology for the rehabilitation of the upper&#xD;
           extremities in this type of population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be carried out under the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (World&#xD;
      Medical Association) and will be approved by the ethics committee of the University of&#xD;
      Valencia. In addition, all participants will be asked to sign an informed consent that will&#xD;
      include all the sections required by this committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 20 participants per group is established, establishing a power of 80%, an&#xD;
      ability to detect a small effect size (Coehn's d = 0.3) for the main variable mobility&#xD;
      measured with Nedcodo Agile and a probability of type I error. of 0.05, resulting in a total&#xD;
      of 80 participants. In order to minimize possible losses, 25% more patients will be added per&#xD;
      group, so 100 people will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria will be the following: i. spinal cord injury with AIS C, D or E, ii.&#xD;
      ability to understand instructions (Mini-Mental State Examination&gt; 23 points). The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be the following: i. traumatic pathology in upper limbs, ii. other alterations&#xD;
      of the central nervous system or peripheral, iii. alterations in the vestibular system and&#xD;
      iv. concomitant diseases. The participants will be divided into the four groups described&#xD;
      above randomly using a computer program. Compliance with the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      verified by the physiotherapists specializing in the pathologies understudy at the Faculty of&#xD;

      interventions. In the first evaluation, anthropometric and demographic data (i.e. height,&#xD;
      weight, age, educational level, possible comorbidities, etc.) will be collected in order to&#xD;
      control, in case of heterogeneity, these confounding variables. The clinical assessment will&#xD;
      be composed of the study of the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor function and motor skills: Hand assessment app, Nedcodo Agile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper limb isometric force: load cell (CTCS; Mutronic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle activation: BTS FreeEMG Electromyograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain: Brief Pain Inventory, Visual Analog Pain Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle tone: Modified Ashworth Scale and MyotonPRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life: Quality of life index, Spinal cord injury, version III.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functionality: Spinal Cord Independence Measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis will be carried out using the SPSS statistical program (version 26). The&#xD;
      normality of the sample will be analyzed using the Shapiro Wilk test and homoscedasticity&#xD;

      out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General mobility and warm-up: flexion-extension joint movements, rotations, deviations,&#xD;
           abduction-adduction, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gross mobility and coordination: ball games.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fine mobility and coordination: writing tasks, puzzles, abacus ...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strength exercises: shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stretching. ii. IV placebo and PE: the configuration of the work table will be the same&#xD;
