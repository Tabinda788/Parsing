      This is an observational, non-interventional, single-arm multicenter study. The objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to assess safety and effectiveness of Forxiga in a real world setting in&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of a post-approval commitment, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) of the&#xD;
      Republic of Korea (hereinafter &quot;Korea&quot;) requests a study to characterize the safety in&#xD;
      patients treated with dapagliflozin by physicians in normal clinical practice settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In principle, all patients treated (minimum of 900 required) with the product in accordance&#xD;
      with the newly updated local prescribing information for HFrEF and/or CKD are eligible for&#xD;
      the enrolment in this study. Product prescription and patient enrollment will depend on&#xD;
      physicians' medical decision as per routine clinical practice. Patient follow-up will be 12&#xD;
      weeks or about 24 weeks (for long-term surveillance) and patients will be recruited over a&#xD;
      period of 4 years after the new HFrEF indication approval by the local health authorities.&#xD;
      This is due to the requirements from the local health authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety profile of the product in Korean&#xD;
      adult patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and/or chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) in a real world setting under the approved indication(s) in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the product,&#xD;
      measured as: 1) no worsening in NYHA class, in Korean patients with HFrEF and/or 2) no&#xD;
      worsening in UACR category in Korean CKD patients in a real world setting under the approved&#xD;
      indication(s) in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective of this study is to identify patients' baseline characteristics&#xD;
      that might be associated with the safety and effectiveness of the product when prescribed&#xD;
      under the approved indication(s) in Korean patients with HFrEF and/or CKD during the 12 weeks&#xD;
      or about 24 weeks of follow-up duration.&#xD;
