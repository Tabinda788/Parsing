      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make and safely administer a&#xD;
      'personalized' cancer vaccine for people diagnosed with an upper gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that cancer has mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an&#xD;
      individual person and their tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce&#xD;
      proteins that are different from the body's normal, healthy cells. The study will use a&#xD;
      sample of your tumor to create a vaccine against it, with the idea being that the study&#xD;
      vaccine will &quot;teach&quot; the body's immune system to recognize and attack the cancer cells. The&#xD;
      study will examine the safety of the study vaccine when given at several time points and will&#xD;
      examine your blood for signs that the study vaccine causes the immune system to respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personalized cancer vaccine will be given alone or in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab. Nivolumab is a drug that blocks certain proteins on cells that help to keep&#xD;
      immune responses in check. In a healthy person, this keeps the immune system from attacking&#xD;
      healthy cells and tissues, but cancer cells use these proteins to keep the immune system from&#xD;
      killing cancer cells and tumors. When these proteins are blocked, the check on the immune&#xD;
      system is removed and immune cells may be able to recognize and kill cancer cells. Ipilimumab&#xD;
      is a drug that helps to activate the body's immune response against cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This personalized cancer vaccine is considered experimental because it is not approved by the&#xD;
      US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of nivolumab, ipilimumab, and the personalized cancer vaccine is experimental&#xD;
      and is not FDA approved.&#xD;
