  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present investigation aims to study a novel plant based protein isolate blend to&#xD;
      determine if it results in similar muscle building responses compared to whey protein&#xD;
      isolate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whey protein is considered the 'gold standard' to maintain body proteins (muscle, skin,&#xD;
      bone). When isolated from milk, whey protein isolate (WPI) contains all nine essential amino&#xD;
      acids (EAA) which are 'building blocks' that are needed to support the maintenance of body&#xD;
      proteins. To date, there is no plant-based protein (PBP) isolate that compares to the&#xD;
      recommended WPI towards how our body builds or supports our muscles. WPI is considered the&#xD;
      'gold standard' because it contains all of the EAA which provide the right amount of&#xD;
      'building blocks' to support our muscles. Current PBP isolates available contain insufficient&#xD;
      amounts of EAA, and are less digestible, resulting in less 'building blocks' available to&#xD;
      support our muscles. Recently, plant protein combinations have been designed to provide the&#xD;
      right amounts of all the EAAs. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to determine the&#xD;
      effects of a novel PBP blend on muscle protein synthesis responses by comparing it to WPI.&#xD;

    <description>Whey protein isolate is the 'gold standard' of protein supplements due to being rich in essential amino acids and leucine. Leucine is a key amino acid the is required to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Muscle protein synthesis is the major mechanism the underpins muscle growth. The whey protein would ostensibly serve as a positive control.</description>
