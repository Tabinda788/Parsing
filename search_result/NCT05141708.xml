      This non-interventional retrospective study will describe real-world treatment patterns and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes among adults with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with germline&#xD;
      BRCA1/2 mutations who initiated talazoparib as a first or later line of therapy. Patients&#xD;

             diagnosis date on or after January 1, 2011. This includes patients who were diagnosed&#xD;
             with stage IV at diagnosis or were diagnosed with earlier stage disease, then&#xD;
             developed a distant metastasis later on, or had recurrence of the disease via a&#xD;
             distant metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed receipt of talazoparib as treatment for mBC via abstraction initiated&#xD;
             between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2 negative test result on or before the start of patient's first&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation, or BRCA germline mutation not&#xD;
             otherwise specified, identified on or before the start date of patient's first&#xD;
             talazoparib-containing line of therapy, as defined by Flatiron's line of therapy&#xD;
             business rules&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older at the time of first talazoparib-containing line of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lacking relevant unstructured documents in the Flatiron database for review by the&#xD;
             abstraction team&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of drug as part of a clinical trial (captured in the database as &quot;clinical&#xD;
             study drug&quot; without additional information about active ingredient or whether the&#xD;
             patient received placebo), defined as any non-cancelled order, administration, or oral&#xD;
             episode for a drug used in a clinical trial, on or prior to start of first talazoparib&#xD;
             line of therapy, as defined by Flatiron's line of therapy business rules&#xD;
