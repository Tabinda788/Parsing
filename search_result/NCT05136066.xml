  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Birth is a very special experience for a woman and her family. Labor pain is one of the&#xD;
      strongest known and defined pains today. In the literature, it has been stated that labor&#xD;
      pain is perceived as more severe than chronic pain such as low back pain, cancer pain,&#xD;
      phantom pain and postherpetic neuralgia, and acute pain such as fracture or laceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When birth pain is not controlled, the vicious cycle of stress, fear and pain can continue&#xD;
      and affect the mother and fetus negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, our aim is to determine the effect of applying peppermint oil diluted with&#xD;
      pure natural olive oil to the abdomen and waist region by massage in labor pain, reducing the&#xD;
      labor pain.&#xD;

      The study is a Prospective Cross-sectional Case Control study. Pregnant women whose mother&#xD;
      tongue is Turkish, who are term pregnant and who are in active labor, who are hospitalized in&#xD;
      the delivery room of our hospital for delivery, that is, who have a gap of at least 70% 5-6&#xD;
      cm in the examination and who have at least 4-5 severe contractions in 10 minutes, who have a&#xD;
      single, vertex-presented fetus will be included in our work. Pregnant women with&#xD;
      co-morbidities, chronic diseases, complications related to childbirth, anemic inactive labor,&#xD;
      thyroid disease, skin lesions or infections, allergies, multiple pregnancies, use of any&#xD;
      medication, and risky pregnancy will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, 30 pregnant women who were applied peppermint oil and 30 control group pregnant&#xD;
      women who were not applied will be included in the study. Following the signed consent form&#xD;
      obtained from our patients, visual analog scoring (VAS) will be provided to the patient&#xD;
      during the painful period, and then peppermint oil will be applied to the abdomen and lumbar&#xD;
      region where he feels the most pain, with 1/10 diluted peppermint oil by hand massage or with&#xD;
      the help of a compress moistened with warm water. After the application, visual pain scoring&#xD;
      will be applied to pregnant women again.The study is terminated when sufficient data is&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be entered into the computer in the SPSS program.&#xD;
