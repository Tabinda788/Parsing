  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of&#xD;
      NKG2D-based CAR-T cells infusion in the treatment of relapsed/refractory NKG2DL+ solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The preclinical study clarified that NKG2D-based CAR-T cells showed strong cytotoxicity&#xD;
      against NKG2DL+ cell lines in vitro as well as a therapeutic effect against NKG2DL+ cell&#xD;
      xenografts in vivo. In addition, the data also demonstrated the safety of NKG2D-based CAR-T&#xD;
      therapy. NKG2D-based CART represent a potentially effective and safety therapeutic approach&#xD;
      for patient with relapsed/refractory NKG2DL+ solid tumors. In this trial, the investigators&#xD;
      researched the safety of administering NKG2D-based CAR-T which generated with CD8 hinge&#xD;
      region and transmembrane region, 4-1BB costimulatory region and CD3 zeta region. The&#xD;
      investigators also assessed that disease response was determined within the context of a&#xD;
      phase I trial.&#xD;
