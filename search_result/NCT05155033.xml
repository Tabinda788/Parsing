    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose interleukin-2 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma, with overall response rates of 15-16%. Complete regression of disease&#xD;
      was seen in 6-7% of participants with many long-term durable responses. The regimen has not&#xD;
      been widely adopted due to complexities in management and the development of alternative&#xD;
      effective therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints (ipilimumab,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or small molecule inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma based on a&#xD;
      series of studies demonstrating objective response rates from 21-34%. There remains a&#xD;
      considerable population of participants with disease that never responded to treatment, in&#xD;
      addition to participants with short durations of response prior to recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been limited clinical investigation of the combination of interleukin-2 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. The hypothesis under investigation is that non-specific activation of the&#xD;
      immune system with both positive stimulation (aldesleukin) and release of negative regulation&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab) may have meaningful clinical impact for participants with limited therapeutic&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the objective response rate as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria to combined&#xD;
      aldesleukin and pembrolizumab in participants with advanced melanoma refractory to anti-PD-1&#xD;
      therapy and treatment-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine progression free survival with the combined regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the objective response rate as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria to combined&#xD;
      aldesleukin and pembrolizumab in participants with treatment-na(SqrRoot) ve advanced melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate clinical and laboratory correlates of response&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform immunologic correlative studies of peripheral blood, tumor, and/or tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes including but not limited to phenotype and functional analysis of&#xD;
      longitudinal samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be/have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected survival of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma or renal cell cancer, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Metastatic melanoma or advanced locoregional melanoma not amenable to curative&#xD;
      surgical resection and refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (clear cell histology) refractory to at least one&#xD;
      line of PD1/PDL1 based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Metastatic or advanced locoregional melanoma not amenable to curative surgical&#xD;
      resection na(SqrRoot) ve to anti-PD-1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin or pembrolizumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No history of Grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events affecting major organ systems&#xD;
      associated with the administration of single agent pembrolizumab or nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be given in two courses. A course shall consist of two cycles (each 21&#xD;
      days) of treatment. Cycles in Course 1 shall consist of pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) infusion on&#xD;
      the morning of Day 1 with aldesleukin (IL-2) administration (600,000 IU/kg intravenous bolus&#xD;
      every eight hours) to begin later that day. IL-2 will be administered to tolerance or to a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second cycle of treatment will begin on Day 21 (+ 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately two months from the beginning of therapy, participants will be evaluated for&#xD;
      response including physical exam, clinical laboratory testing, and cross-sectional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that do not demonstrate progressive disease will receive a second course of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab alone, if clinically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with stable disease will be monitored until disease progression (every 3 months&#xD;
      x 3) up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with an objective response will be monitored until disease progression (every 3&#xD;
      months x 3, every 6 months x 8) up to five years.&#xD;

                  must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than four weeks must have elapsed since completion of any prior systemic therapy&#xD;
             at the time of enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;

             and AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major organ autoimmune disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who have decreased&#xD;
