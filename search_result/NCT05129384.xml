  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether B. infantis EVC001 colonization in the infant gut can reduce symptoms&#xD;
      of colic&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to support that B. infantis EVC001 supplementation may ameliorate symptoms&#xD;
      associated with colic by establishing and maintaining the necessary gut microbial composition&#xD;
      to promote proper barrier and immune function in infants. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to assess the effect of the probiotic, B. infantis EVC001, on reducing the duration of&#xD;
      crying/fussing symptoms of breastfed infants diagnosed with infantile colic from Baseline to&#xD;
      Day 14.&#xD;
