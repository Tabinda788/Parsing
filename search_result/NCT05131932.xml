    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected extra-esophageal manifestations of gastro-esophageal reflux disease&#xD;
      (GERD), such as cough, hoarseness, and globus, are often referred for pH testing. However,&#xD;
      many of these symptoms may actually be due to an esophageal inlet patch. We aim to evaluate&#xD;
      patients referred for pH testing to see if they have an inlet patch, to perform ablation of&#xD;
      the inlet patch if detected, and then compare the outcomes of patients with an inlet patch&#xD;
      who underwent ablation versus those without an inlet patch.&#xD;

      Background The diagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is difficult when&#xD;
      patients present with extra-esophageal symptoms such as chronic cough, frequent throat&#xD;
      clearing, globus sensation, sore throat, and hoarseness, as opposed to the traditional&#xD;
      symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation.[1-4] These patients are often given a trial of&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to see if their symptoms improve. They often undergo an upper&#xD;
      endoscopy, which is usually unrevealing,[5] and they may be evaluated by other specialties&#xD;
      such as otolaryngology and pulmonology. Eventually, some of these patients are referred for&#xD;
      esophageal pH-testing to evaluate for objective evidence of acid reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms of extra-esophageal GERD (EE-GERD) are not specific for GERD and many of them&#xD;
      overlap with the symptoms from inlet patches, also known as heterotopic gastric mucosa.[6-7]&#xD;
      Inlet patches consist of small areas of gastric mucosa in the upper esophagus that are&#xD;
      capable of producing acid.[8-10] Studies in which inlet patches are endoscopically ablated&#xD;
      have shown improvement in several extra-esophageal symptoms including globus sensation, sore&#xD;
      throat, and cough.[11-15] As inlet patches are notoriously overlooked on upper endoscopy[16]&#xD;
      and can cause many of the same symptoms as EE-GERD, we suspect that they may be responsible&#xD;
      for the symptoms in some patients who are referred for pH-testing due to suspected EE-GERD.&#xD;
      We believe that a careful inspection of the upper esophagus will reveal inlet patches that&#xD;
      were missed on initial endoscopy and that ablation of these inlet patches will help improve&#xD;
      the patients' symptoms more than the standard treatment for EE-GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the improvement in symptoms of patients&#xD;
      referred for pH-testing for suspected EE-GERD that are treated with endoscopic ablation of an&#xD;
      inlet patch versus those who receive standard PPI therapy. Secondarily, we seek to determine&#xD;
      the prevalence of inlet patches in these patients with reportedly normal endoscopies, as well&#xD;
      as percentage of patients in this group with a positive pH study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients referred for pH-testing due to symptoms of possible EE-GERD will be&#xD;
      evaluated. These patients will have their prior medical history reviewed. Those with a prior&#xD;
      normal endoscopy and inadequate response to PPI therapy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' symptoms will be assessed via a questionnaire across 8 domains including 6 symptoms&#xD;
      of possible EE-GERD and 2 subjective scores of how the symptoms are affecting their lives&#xD;
      (see Questionnaire below). A visual Likert scale from 0 to 10 will be used. An overall&#xD;
      symptom score will be calculated based on the results of the 8 individual domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo an upper endoscopy. During the endoscopy, care will be taken to&#xD;
      assess for possible inlet patches. Advanced imaging techniques such as i-scan imaging will be&#xD;
      used to aid in the detection of inlet patches. If one or more inlet patches are found, the&#xD;
      number, size, and shape will be recorded, and it will be biopsied for histological&#xD;
      confirmation. The inlet patch will then be ablated via the use of argon plasma coagulation&#xD;
      (APC) as has been performed in prior studies.[11-13] During the endoscopy, a Bravo pH capsule&#xD;
      will also be placed per standard protocol to complete a 48-hour pH study. The Bravo data will&#xD;
      be interpreted according to standard procedure with a positive study defined as an elevated&#xD;
      DeMeester score on either study day. All studies will be performed off of anti-acid&#xD;
      medications such as PPIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' symptoms will be re-assessed at 2 and 6 months following the endoscopy. This&#xD;
      will be performed via telephone interviews with the patients completing the same symptom&#xD;
      assessments as prior to the endoscopy. Changes in their medications and treatment as a result&#xD;
      of the Bravo pH study results will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be the symptom improvement in overall score in patients who&#xD;
      underwent ablation of inlet patches versus those without inlet patches.&#xD;
