    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease patients needs a functional vascular access to receive hemodialysis&#xD;
      and prolong their lives. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is priority consideration for&#xD;
      hemodialysis, which is a connecting a superficial vein to a nearby artery and allowing this&#xD;
      vein to enlarge and increase in internal diameter under arterial circulation. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      30-50% of fistulae fail to mature. Vascular calcification and stenosis were considered for&#xD;
      early failure. The perivascular fat of artery can be predicted successful AVF maturation.&#xD;
      However, Few previous studies have compared AVF maturation between perivascular the fat of&#xD;
      cephalic vein or removal during the AVF surgery. This study evaluated whether the effect of&#xD;
      AVF inflammation and preexisting vascular fibrosis is associated to perivascular the fat of&#xD;
      cephalic vein. Investigators will also verify inflammation by analysis of blood and tissue&#xD;
      samples, the association of pre-existing fibrosis, and the clinical correlation with AVF&#xD;
      early failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 and stage 6 who will need&#xD;
      maintenance-hemodialysis (HD) from Nov 2021 to Dec 2022. Investigators will use the&#xD;
      preoperative ultrasound assessment tool to confirm the feasibility of the arm vessels for the&#xD;
      creation of a native AVF. As a prospective randomized controlled trial of perivascular fat&#xD;
      preservation or removal during the AVF surgery, a study assistant will help the randomization&#xD;
      and explain the informed consent to the patient . The subjects are randomly split into two&#xD;
      groups: the experimental group will have the perivascular fat of the target cephalic vein&#xD;
      preserved the control group will have the fat removed before the AVF anastomosis. The survey&#xD;
      will enroll 100 adult patients and categorize them into groups according to each AVF&#xD;
      maturation, JAS, or FTM (see definition below) by 3 - 12 after the surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis, which is&#xD;
      surgically created but connecting a superficial vein to nearby artery and allowing this vein&#xD;
      to enlarge and increase in internal diameter under arterial circulation. Successful fistula&#xD;
      maturation depends on dilatation and remodeling of the artery and vein, but the stiff and&#xD;
      thickened vessels of end-stage renal diseases (ESRD) patients may respond poorly to signals&#xD;
      that promote these adaptations. About 20 - 40% of AVFs maturation fails and no effective&#xD;
      treatment to prevent AVF maturation failure. Paulson WD summarized four points for maturation&#xD;
      failure. Surgical skill; preexisting vascular disease; Upstream events; and Downstream&#xD;
      events. Upstream events are the mechanisms that initially cause injury to the endothelium&#xD;
      (surgical trauma, hemodynamic shear stress, vessel wall injury caused by needle punctures,&#xD;
      etc.). Downstream events are the responses to endothelial injury (leukocyte adhesion,&#xD;
      migration of smooth muscle cells from the media to the intimal layer, smooth muscle&#xD;
      proliferation, etc.). However, upstream and downstream events are important steps in&#xD;
      maturation failure, preexisting vascular disease should not be neglected as it sets the stage&#xD;
      for what follows. Medial collagen fibers are organized into lamellar units and oriented&#xD;
      circumferentially with crimps in healthy blood vessels. However, higher medial collagen&#xD;
      content maybe stiffer and limited ability to dilate. Recently, researches have shows&#xD;
      preexisting fibrosis condition in veins was associated with maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation for AVF setting can be divided into two parts: local and systemic inflammation.&#xD;
      For local inflammation had been indicated caused by the trauma of fistula creation and local&#xD;
      hypoxia; For systemic inflammation, which occurs because of uremia present in CKD patients.&#xD;
      Recent study have suggested AVF failure was linked to inflammation. The perivascular fat of&#xD;
      artery can be predicted successful AVF maturation. Lipectomy of cephalic vein is a routine&#xD;
      method during hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula creation[9]. However, Few previous studies&#xD;
      have compared AVF maturation between perivascular the fat of cephalic vein or removal during&#xD;
      the AVF surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful fistula maturation depends upon dilatation and remodeling of the artery and vein,&#xD;
      but the stiff and thickened vessels of ESRD patients may respond poorly to signals that&#xD;
      promote these adaptations. Although our preliminary data showed that preexisting vascular&#xD;
      fibrosis increased in AVFs failure. But the finding still needs more verifications. In this&#xD;
      study, Investigators will focus on the finding of molecular marks to be related to AVFs&#xD;
      maturation or failure. The study include the following sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether vascular fibrosis exists in AVF patients and its association with maturation&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether vascular fibrosis is associated with inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the cytokines expression of neutrophil in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether the perivascular fat of cephalic vein is associated with AVF failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Whether vascular fibrosis exists in AVF patients and its association with maturation&#xD;
      failure. Investigators will observe vascular fibrosis by histopathology and western blot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, the subjects are those adult uremic patients who will undergo an AVF creation.&#xD;
      The survey will enroll the patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 (CKD-5) and&#xD;
      stage 6 (CKD-6) who will need maintenance-hemodialysis (HD). Investigators will use the&#xD;
      preoperative ultrasound assessment tool to confirm the feasibility of the arm vessels for the&#xD;
      creation of a native AVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a prospective randomized controlled trial of perivascular fat preservation or removal&#xD;
      during the AVF surgery, a study assistant will help the randomization and explain the&#xD;
      informed consent to the patient. The subjects are randomly split into two groups: the&#xD;
      experimental group will have the perivascular fat of the target cephalic vein preserved the&#xD;
      control group will have the fat removed before the AVF anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will harvest the distal vein stump and 1 cm of subcutaneous fat for at least&#xD;
      1.5-cm in length during an AVF creation, at the same time will get a 10-cc plasma sample. The&#xD;
      survey will enroll 100 adult patients and categorize them into groups according to each AVF&#xD;
      maturation, JAS, or FTM (see definition below) by 3 - 12 after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative vascular ultrasound assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have clinical and ultrasound exam to assess the suitability of surgery, The&#xD;
      patient will be excluded If their vessels and/or clinical condition are not suitable used to&#xD;
      hemodialysis. A hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula (HDAVF) maturity score based on the&#xD;
      following three objective ultrasonic measurements. Give a summary score range from 0 to 9&#xD;
      points. Higher scores indicating more mature. Ultrasound testing parameters are defined as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measuring the arm artery diameter and total blood flow. The brachial artery is defined&#xD;
           as measured from the proximal 4 (+/- 2,2 to 6) cms within the curved line of the elbow,&#xD;
           Investigators will measure the vascular diameter and estimate total forearm blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radial artery scan of the forearm is defined as the diameter of the radial artery&#xD;
           scanned from the start of the antecubital to the wrist.line. Notedly, Investigators also&#xD;
           confirm its diameter&gt; = 2.0 mm and identify no obvious stenosis of the antecubital to&#xD;
           the wrist.line. Notedly, Investigators also confirm its diameter&gt; = 2.0 mm and identify&#xD;
           no obvious stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure the non-augmented diameter of the cephalic vein. The midpoint of it is defined&#xD;
           as the middle between the elbow line and the wrist line, Which is around 10 (+/- 2, 8 ~&#xD;
           12) cms distal to the elbow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measure the augmented diameter of the cephalic vein. Pressure is applied to the upper&#xD;
           arm with tourniquet cuff to 100-mm-Hg temporarily and which provides moderate&#xD;
           resistance, wait 30 seconds, then investigators measure the cephalic vein where has been&#xD;
           defined above. Accordingly, the definition of venous compliance is defined as the degree&#xD;
           of venous dilatation of the cephalic vein before and after augmentation. Furthermore,&#xD;
           the compliance of vein is defined as the percentage of augmented / non-augmented&#xD;
           cross-section area of the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Investigators will confirm the whole segment of cephalic vein is to be&gt; 2.0 mm in&#xD;
           diameter and identify no significant stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of clinical success: It is defined as the target HDAVF can be used by two needles&#xD;
      and complete the HD session for at least ⅔ of prescribing sessions in a month. A minimum&#xD;
      criterion of a run is at an average blood flow rate of 300 ml/min in a 3.5-hour HD session to&#xD;
      achieve a target sp-Kt/V of 1.2.14 In which a successful HD session is defined as completion&#xD;
      of HD with a dialysis flow rate is more than 200 ml/min, and a session duration of 4 hours or&#xD;
      more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of success by ultrasound parameters: the survey proposes an objective ultrasound&#xD;
      scoring system and considers a total score of four or more as AVF maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For histology analysis, samples were paraffin-embedded and sectioned. H&amp;E (hematoxylin and&#xD;
      eosin) are common stains used in histology. The hematoxylin stains cell nuclei is blue, and&#xD;
      eosin stains the extracellular matrix and cytoplasm presents pink. The Movat pentachrome&#xD;
      staining can be demonstrated that collagen, elastin, muscle mucin and fibrin in tissue&#xD;
      sections. Investigators use Sirius-red staining to observe the collagen I and III fibers in&#xD;
      tissue sections. In order to detect calcium deposits, Investigators use Alizan red staining.&#xD;
      The Masson's trichrome will be used to stain. In the trichrome stain, smooth muscle appears&#xD;
      red, and collagen appears blue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For western blot assay, collagen, α-SMA, TIMP-1, and TIMP2 expression will increase in&#xD;
      vascular fibrosis. Hence, investigators will detect expression of collagen, α-SMA, MMP-9,&#xD;
      MMP2, TIMP-1, TIMP2 in AVF maturation and failure tissue. Tissues were homogenized and lysed.&#xD;
      Protein concentration for each tissue extract was determined using a BCA protein assay&#xD;
      according to the instructions of the supplier (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Illinois, USA).&#xD;
      Fifty microgram of tissue lysates protein per lane were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing&#xD;
      conditions and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Massachusetts, USA).&#xD;
      Membranes were blocked in 5% defatted dry milk/ PBS/0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and were then&#xD;
      incubated with the primary antibody for 1 hour. Blots were washed 4 times PBST, and the&#xD;
      secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora-tories Inc., West&#xD;
      Grove, Pennsylvania, USA) was added (1:10,000) for another hour. Finally, membranes were&#xD;
      washed in PBST, and detection of the antigen was carried out using the enhanced&#xD;
      chemiluminescence detection method according to the manufacturer's recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Whether vascular fibrosis is associated with inflammation. Inflammation in the setting&#xD;
      of AVF was involved locally and systemically. Local inflammation caused by trauma of fistula&#xD;
      creation and local hypoxia. So, investigators will measure the IL8, IL1b, IL6, IL10, TNF,&#xD;
      IL12p70, CCL5(RANTES), CXCL9 (MIG), CCL2 (MCP1), IP10 and compare expression between AVF&#xD;
      maturation and failure tissue by QPCR and Multiplex ELISA. Beside, systemic inflammation&#xD;
      occurs because of uremia that is present in chronic kidney diseases. Also, investigators will&#xD;
      detect expression of IL8, IL1b, IL6, IL10, TNF, IL12p70, CCL5(RANTES), CXCL9 (MIG), CCL2&#xD;
      (MCP1), IP10 and compare expression between AVF maturation and failure serum by CBA assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For QPCR assay, RNA was extracted from vein tissue by the TRIzol protocol (Life Technologies,&#xD;
      Invitrogen). RNA concentrations were quantified by Nanodrop. The purity of the total RNA&#xD;
      extracted was determined as the 260/280 nm ratio and the integrity was checked. QPCR was&#xD;
      performed by the TaqMan system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ELISA assay, tissues were lysed in PBS buffer and using commercial ELISA kits (R&amp;D)&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's protocol. The lysates were normalized to the total protein&#xD;
      content determined using a commercial BCA protein assay kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cytokine Bead Array (CBA) assay, the Human Inflammatory Cytokines CBA Kit (BD&#xD;
      Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used, which measures all of the above cytokines except GM-CSF,&#xD;
      IL-2, and IFN-γ; data were acquired on a BDTM FACS caliber flow cytometer. Both assays were&#xD;
      performed according to the manufacturer's instructions except for the use of modified&#xD;
      calibration curves as described below. All standards and samples were measured in duplicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Examine the cytokines expression profile of neutrophilic in blood. To perform this,&#xD;
      investigators will examine the peripheral blood neutrophil population by flow cytometry stain&#xD;
      with CD11b+/CD66b/CD34/CD45. Next to determine the percentage of neutrophils expressing&#xD;
      target cytokines in peripheral blood.&#xD;
