      This project aims to test a behavioral intervention in patients with liver cirrhosis and&#xD;
      chronic pain and teach self pain-management skills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioid medications are a leading cause of opioid-related death and are&#xD;
      particularly risky in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which affects 4 million people in&#xD;
      the US. In this population, prescription opioids are associated with complications of liver&#xD;
      disease, decreased access to life-saving transplantation, and increased hospitalization,&#xD;
      post-transplant mortality, and all-cause mortality. Moreover, most patients with cirrhosis&#xD;
      have underlying alcohol and/or substance use disorders (SUDs), which increase the risk of&#xD;
      opioid-related complications and misuse. Despite these risks, our pilot work found that&#xD;
      nearly half of all patients with cirrhosis are prescribed opioid medications each year and&#xD;
      that these prescriptions are often inconsistent with opioid prescribing safety guidelines.&#xD;
      One potential reason for this may be the lack of safe, evidence-based, alternative pain&#xD;
      management strategies for this patient population. Indeed, existing opioid safety and pain&#xD;
      management interventions designed for general populations do not address many of the specific&#xD;
      issues facing patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team plans to recruit patients at UPMC for participation in the Liver Education&#xD;
      About Pain (LEAP) intervention program. LEAP is a modular 12-week pain self-management&#xD;
      intervention with alternating group and individual sessions. Group sessions allow&#xD;
      participants to practice skills, set goals with the group, seek social support, and learn&#xD;
      together. Individual sessions serve the purpose of individualizing the program to the needs&#xD;
      of the patients. The purpose of the LEAP program is to make pain better, help patients reach&#xD;
      their personal goals (things that may be hard to do because of pain), and add to the care&#xD;
      patients' medical team is providing.&#xD;

    <description>The primary acceptability outcome will be overall satisfaction with the intervention and will be operationalized using the Client Satisfaction Questionniare-8, an 8-item Likert-based general satisfaction measure that sums to a score of 8 to 32. A total score of ≥24, indicating an average score of &quot;satisfied&quot; across items, in at least 80% of participants will be operationalized as &quot;acceptable.&quot;</description>

    <description>Half of the recruited patients (anticipate 20) will participate in 12 weekly sessions to teach self-pain management tools and skills. In addition to alternating weeks of group and individual sessions, participants will track their activities using the LEAP workbook provided during the first meeting, as tracking is a key component of most pain-self management interventions and is intended to address self-regulation. All patients can continue to use other pain management strategies (&quot;usual care&quot;) in order to mimic real-life conditions.</description>
