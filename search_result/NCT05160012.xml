  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of a roll out of new payment model for physicians based on hypertension control, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate a monthly peer comparison message to Primary Care Providers at&#xD;
      Penn Medicine Lancaster to see whether provider engagement with patients' overall&#xD;
      hypertension management increases, as measured by new or increasing doses of&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN) affects about 30% of US adults, and effective treatment that reduces&#xD;
      long-term risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease is widely available; however, only about&#xD;
      half of adults maintain good control. HTN control requires diagnosis, initiation of&#xD;
      treatment, adherence to medications, and titration of medications. The investigators' prior&#xD;
      work from Way2Text and SupportBP showed that there is significant clinical inertia in&#xD;
      escalating medications for HTN through increasing dosage or adding new medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have shown that providing feedback to providers with peer comparison data can&#xD;
      leverage social norms to improve evidence-based practices in antibiotic and statin&#xD;
      prescribing. Penn Medicine Lancaster General Primary Care is rolling out a Hypertension&#xD;
      Control Implementation Plan (HCIP) as an initiative to improve hypertension control through&#xD;
      creation of a clinic-based pathway to identify patients with hypertension, appropriately&#xD;
      measure blood pressure, and prescribe medications to reduce blood pressure. Busy PCPs have&#xD;
      competing demands of care, so there is an opportunity to leverage peer comparison to nudge&#xD;
      providers to adhere to the HCIP and intensify medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a stratified parallel-group cluster-randomized trial. PCPs will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by practice, to either: 1) Control: Usual Care- This&#xD;
      will include the standard HCIP roll-out, and PCPs can access their HTN control rates using&#xD;
      the existing EPIC dashboard.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary Care Providers who have at =&gt;30 patients hypertension as determined by the HTN&#xD;
             quality metric&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients will be counted in the denominator of the quality metric if they have both&#xD;

             the last year (including office visits, well child, prenatal visit, consult visit,&#xD;
             confidential, e-visit, nursing only, home/offsite visit, and telemedicine) that is&#xD;

&#xD;
