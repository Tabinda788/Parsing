    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective database pre-post cohort study, identifying asthmatic patients with&#xD;
      omalizumab use over 24 months. Omalizumab use was analyzed in two categories. First,&#xD;
      initiators were defined as individuals with ≥ 1 omalizumab claims. &quot;Responders&quot; were defined&#xD;
      as individuals with at least 4 omalizumab claims. Descriptive statistics are provided for&#xD;
      both groups, but outcomes are reported only for responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, any persons from the Marketscan database with an asthma diagnosis and &gt;= 1&#xD;
      omalizumab prescription/administration during the index period were identified. From this&#xD;
      patient population the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, resulting in the final&#xD;
      study cohort. Each person was assigned an index date based on their initial use of&#xD;
      omalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: 07/07/2015 - 12/31/2019 Index Period: 07/07/2016 - 12/31/2018 Index Date: The&#xD;
      date of the first medical or pharmacy claim of omalizumab Baseline Period (pre-index): 12&#xD;
      months before index date Follow up Period (post-index): 12 months after index date&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MarketScan® Claims Database (including commercial and Medicaid claims) was used. The&#xD;
      claims database included data from 07/08/2015 - 12/31/2019. The MarketScan® Databases capture&#xD;
      personspecific clinical utilization, expenditures, and enrollment across inpatient,&#xD;
      outpatient, prescription drug, and carve-out services from a selection of large employers,&#xD;
      health plans, and government and public organizations. The current study used the Commercial,&#xD;
      Medicare Supplemental and Multi-State Medicaid Databases.&#xD;

&#xD;
        We used all eligible Marketscan beneficiaries with an asthma diagnosis and omalizumab use&#xD;
        between 07/07/2016 - 12/31/2018 (index period). Continuous enrollment in the Marketscan&#xD;
