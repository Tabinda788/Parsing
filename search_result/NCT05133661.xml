  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of integrating into existing health&#xD;
      systems, provision of HPV screening and treatment of pre-cancerous cervical cancer lesions&#xD;
      with ablative treatments in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guatemala, and the Philippines.&#xD;
      Study findings will inform implementation of cervical cancer prevention and treatment&#xD;
      services as part of a global effort to eliminate cervical cancer, with particular relevance&#xD;
      for low-and-middle income countries. This will inform country strategy and guidelines on&#xD;
      offering integrated cervical cancer prevention and treatment services in a manner that is&#xD;
      culturally sensitive, client oriented, and system appropriate.&#xD;

      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How feasible is it to implement integrated HPV testing (including self-collection of&#xD;
           samples) and ablative treatment of lesions precancerous cervical cancer lesions among&#xD;
           HPV+ women aged 30-49 years (general population) and 25-49 years (WLHIV), leveraging on&#xD;
           the existing health systems in the four study countries?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the acceptability of HPV screening through self-collection or clinician&#xD;
           collection of sample, and ablative treatment of precancerous lesions among women&#xD;
           accessing cervical cancer services in the study sites?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the cost of implementing integrated cervical cancer screening and precancer&#xD;
           treatment services (Supply: counselling, HPV testing, treatment, training health care&#xD;
           providers, etc.), and user-related costs (travel, out of pocket expenses opportunity&#xD;
           costs, etc.) in the SUCCESS project supported sites?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Which factors influence the successful implementation of integrated HPV screening and&#xD;
           treatment services (e.g. perceptions, experience of care, religious beliefs, culture,&#xD;
           individual characteristics, availability of services, cost, etc.)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will utilize a hybrid effectiveness implementation Type III study design, using mixed&#xD;
      methods approach. We will screen 2227 women in each country (disaggregated by general&#xD;
      population and WLHIV) and follow those who are HPV positive to determine the completion of&#xD;
      screen-to-treat within three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected from clients, service providers, key&#xD;
      stakeholders, and secondary analysis of service delivery including laboratory data will be&#xD;
      analyzed to assess acceptability and feasibility of implementing integrated cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening and treatment services in the four countries.&#xD;
