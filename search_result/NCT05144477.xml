    <textblock>
      The present study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Enroll 15 partners of CA patients to (a) pilot recruitment procedures, (b) estimate&#xD;
      retention, and (c) assess acceptability of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partners will be randomized to either complete an ICU diary or to a control condition, and&#xD;
      will complete surveys in the ICU, at patient discharge, and 30 days post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Obtain an estimate of the association of intervention v. control with (i) partner fear&#xD;
      (operationalized as cardiac anxiety about the patients' cardiac condition) at hospital&#xD;
      discharge and (ii) partner PTSS 30 days post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims: Obtain an estimate of the association of intervention v. control with&#xD;
      partner aversive cognitions towards exercise at hospital discharge.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cardiac arrest (CA) is a terrifying experience for patients, but maybe even more so for&#xD;
      their loved ones. CA patients often have little to no memory of the CA and are often&#xD;
      unconscious for substantial parts of their hospitalization, particularly their time in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) . In contrast, family members often witness all of these things,&#xD;
      resulting in high levels of fear and psychological distress in family members. This&#xD;
      phenomenon is so prevalent that it has been termed Post-Intensive Care Syndrome - Family&#xD;
      (PICS - Family).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically, emotions are socially transmitted and memories are socially constructed. In this&#xD;
      manner, partners can transmit their distress onto patients. Prior research has suggested that&#xD;
      patients experiencing CA will develop memories of the CA event over time - potentially&#xD;
      because they are trying to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; in their memory. As such, partners may play a&#xD;
      critical role in creating and cementing fear-based memories and distress in patients&#xD;
      experiencing a CA. CA patients often report cardiac fear and preoccupation. This is not&#xD;
      without consequence: fear-based distress, particularly early anxiety related to symptoms&#xD;
      (e.g., rapid heartbeat) and markers for PTSS in other patient populations predicts reduced&#xD;
      engagement in behavior necessary for secondary prevention (e.g., reduced physical activity)&#xD;
      and increased morbidity and mortality. Distress in partners can also have an adverse impact&#xD;
      on patients by undermining the capacity of partners to provide effective social support that&#xD;
      can buffer patient distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prior clinical trial found that family-authored diaries significantly reduced PTSS in&#xD;
      family members (26.3% lower in intervention v. control conditions, 95% CI 4.8, 52.2) and&#xD;
      trended towards a reduction in PTSS for patients (11.2% lower, 95% CI 15.7, 46.8). However,&#xD;
      mechanisms of these effects were not examined, and no dyadic effects were tested.&#xD;
      Furthermore, these previous diary studies have been conducted with the intention of sharing&#xD;
      diaries with patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will test the feasibility involving a similar Family-Authored ICU-diary&#xD;
      intervention to reduce a proximal, dyadic mechanism: fear of CA in patients' partners. The&#xD;
      target audience of the diary is thus partners, and patients will not see the diary unless the&#xD;
      partner individually chooses to share it. The feasibility of targeting partner well-being&#xD;
      alone is untested. The long-term goal is conducting a large scale randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT) that tests whether a family-authored ICU diary can reduce fear of cardiac arrest in&#xD;
      family members, and in turn, improve patients' mental wellbeing, health behaviors, and,&#xD;
      ultimately, health outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive a hard-cover diary, written instructions on diary completion, and a pen. A trained research assistant will meet with the participant either face to face or via telephone and explain how to use the diary. Instructions will include recommended frequency for writing (at least twice a week) and tips on how to express themselves. Potential topics will also be addressed, including what to write about in the beginning, during the ICU, and after ICU discharge. The hard copy of the diary will remain with the partner participant, and they will be asked to continue writing in the diary at least until patient discharge from the hospital. Research assistants will check in with participants via weekly telephone calls to provide prompts to remind them to use the diary and to provide support, as needed, if the partner reports difficulty in writing diary entries. These calls will last approximately 1-5 minutes and will continue until patient discharge from the hospital.</description>
