  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A mild cognitive impairment was observed in 50% of cochlear implant candidates aged 65 years&#xD;
      and over, compared to 5-19% in general population. No studies analysed cognition in patients&#xD;
      younger than 65 years. The aim of our study was to compare cognitive function between&#xD;
      patients with severe and profound hearing loss and patients with normal hearing in patients&#xD;
      aged 45 to 64 years.&#xD;

      This case-control study will include 180 middle aged adults (90 cases, 90 healthy controls)&#xD;
      matched on sex, age, education level in order to find an association between severe and&#xD;
      profound hearing loss and presence of mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 subjects with severe to profound hearing loss,, with a maximum speech intelligibility of&#xD;
      70% for Fournier's disyllabic words in silence with properly fitted hearing aids could be&#xD;
      included. Cognition evaluated on a battery of 5 tests, depression and dependance will be&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls with normal hearing on pure-tone audiometry (as function of ISO&#xD;
      7029 reference) The subjects (cases and controls) will be recruited in the ENT consultation&#xD;
      from the Cochlear Implant Center (Unité fonctionnelle implants auditifs, Pitié-Salpêtrière&#xD;
      Hospital, Head: Dr Isabelle Mosnier)&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>16-item Free and Cue Selective Recall Test (RLRI/16): test adapted in French from the Free and Cue Selective Reminding test (FCSRT) assessing episodic memory. After an encoding phase during which the subject reads and memorizes 16 words 4 by 4, the subject is asked to freely recall as many words as possible in 2 minutes, cues are then provided. The free and cue recall is repeated 3 times and then 20 minutes later (delayed recall). The score used in the study will be: sum of the immediate free recall of the first three trials (0 to 48) and score of the delayed free recall (0 to 16)</description>

    <description>Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) of the Weschsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV): test assessing attention, psychomotor speed and executive functions, executive functions. This test presents a matrix of nine digit-symbol pairs on a sheet of paper. A list of 135 numbers is presented in random order. The subject must associate the symbol corresponding to the number as quickly as possible by following the matrix. The score used will be: number of correctly associated symbols in 90 seconds</description>
