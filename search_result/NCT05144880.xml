    <textblock>
      Two groups of subjects will be included 55 subjects in electroacupuncture with 2Hz group, 55&#xD;
      subjects in the electroacupuncture with 100Hz group. The clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      electroacupuncture with different frequencies (2 Hz, 100 Hz) in the treatment of MDD will be&#xD;
      observed by evaluation indicators, such as Self-rating depression scale and Hamilton&#xD;
      depression scale.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety and depression severity measure by Self-rating depression scale（SDS）</measure>
    <time_frame>There will be evaluated before intervention, at 2, 4weeks after intervention and at the end of 4-weeks follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale contains 20 items that reflect the subjective feelings of depression, 10 of which are positive scores and 10 are reverse scores. Each item is divided into four grades according to the frequency of symptoms, If it is a positive scoring question, it will be rated as 1, 2, 3, and 4 points; for a reverse scoring question, it will be rated as 4, 3, 2, and 1. After the evaluation, add up the scores in the 20 items to get the total rough score, and then multiply the rough score by 1.25 and take the integer part to get the standard score</description>

    <measure>Change in the severity of depression measure by Hamilton depression scale (HAMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>There will be evaluated before intervention, at 2, 4weeks after intervention and at the end of 4-weeks follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is performed by two trained raters to perform a HAMD, usually in the form of conversation and observation. After the examination, the two raters will score independently</description>

    <description>A total of 12 treatment sessions will be administered to each participant. The acupoints of needles inserted for each participant in each session are DU20, EX-HN1, DU29, HT17, PC6, RN6, RN4, LR3 and SP6. The needles will be manually stimulated by rotating, thrusting, stirring, etc. to produce ''De Qi'' sensation. Then we will use electroacupuncture for acupoint stimulation lasting 30min. The frequency will be set as 2Hz for the electroacupuncture with 2Hz group and the frequency will be set as 100Hz for the electroacupuncture with 100Hz group.</description>
