    <textblock>
      A study protocol for analyze the influence of therapeutic education on the metabolic control&#xD;
      of patients with type I diabetes. To measure the change in glucose levels, it will use the&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring sensor that the patients have implanted. It will perform a data&#xD;
      download prior and after to the educational intervention. An assessment of acquired knowledge&#xD;
      will also be performed and it will be analyzed whether learning about their disease and&#xD;
      self-care helps to improve their emotional state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention of this study is only training with therapeutic education, it does not&#xD;
      require any type of extra test or medical or pharmacological product. It will only be&#xD;
      necessary to answer attitudinal questionnaires by the patient&#xD;

      A two-group randomized controlled trial will be used in this project. Participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group will undergo four-session health education program, while the participants&#xD;
      in the control group will receive the existing standard care provided by the hospital.&#xD;
      Measurements will be conducted at the baseline prior to the intervention and at 1 an 3 months&#xD;
      from the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve a well balance in the randomization procedure block randomization of size 10 (with&#xD;
      five experimental and five control) in seal envelops will be used. It will use the&#xD;
      computerized randomization programme to generate the randomization programme to generate the&#xD;
      randomization list using with block size of 10. A team member who will not be involved in&#xD;
      recruitment and data collection will prepare the sealed envelopes according to the generated&#xD;
      randomization list. After a patient is registered, a unique patient ID will be assigned to&#xD;
      the patient based on the sequence of his/her enrolment. The envelope according to the&#xD;
      patient's ID will be opened on site and the patient will be allocated into either one of the&#xD;
      two groups based on the randomization list the treatment indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in control group receive usual services offered in University Hospital and other&#xD;
      local health systems for patients with diabetes, which include regular visits with a diabetes&#xD;
      provider (primary care or endocrine) and standard Spanish Diabetes Society information&#xD;
      pamphlets. Consultation care is centralized in the pharmacological treatment regimen, dosage&#xD;
      and guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to this arm receive therapeutic education during four sessions of&#xD;
      four consecutive days. An advanced practice nurse who specializes in diabetes will teach&#xD;
      these sessions. The sessions will have small groups of five patients and it will last of one&#xD;
      hour each day. The outline of the session is as follow (Figure 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      First session: Insulin administration and blood glucose self-analysis Second session:&#xD;
      Management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia Third session: Healthy diet adapted to the&#xD;
      diabetic patient Four session: Physical exercise&#xD;
