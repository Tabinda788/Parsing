      This is a single arm, open label, phase 2 study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the combination recombinant anti-PD-1 humanized monoclonal antibody injection (609A) and&#xD;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride in the treatment of metastatic/unresectable non-specific soft&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open, multi-center phase 2 study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of 609A combined with doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic/unresectable non-specified soft tissue sarcoma. This study is divided into the&#xD;
      first part (safety introduction period) and the second part (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Security lead-in period The safety lead-in period adopts a single-arm, open design to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary effectiveness of 609A combined with&#xD;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride. Which aimed to explore the Recommended phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Phase 2 This part adopts a single-arm, open, Simon two-stage design to further&#xD;
      evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy and safety of 609A combined with doxorubicin hydrochloride.&#xD;
