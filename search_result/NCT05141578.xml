  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim is to develop and deploy a multidomain intervention delivered on a mobile&#xD;
      application to help middle-aged to older adults reduce their risk for dementia by improving a&#xD;
      set of modifiable lifestyle risk factors associated with cognitive decline/dementia. This&#xD;
      registration concerns the Pilot Feasibility study which examines different aspects of&#xD;
      feasibility in a small-scale randomized pilot study, before implementing an efficacy study on&#xD;
      a larger sample. A secondary objective is to determine whether the program can result in a&#xD;
      larger improvement on risk factors (measured with Behavioural Risk outcomes) compared to a&#xD;
      control intervention. It is expected that persons enrolled in the Luci program show larger&#xD;
      change in Behavioural Risk outcomes than those enrolled in the comparator condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multidomain lifestyle interventions show promising results in reducing the risk of cognitive&#xD;
      decline and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we pilot the feasibility of a coach-based digital multidomain risk-reduction&#xD;
      program to improve cognitive engagement, physical activity, and healthy eating in older&#xD;
      adults at risk of dementia. This trial is the second step in the clinical validation process&#xD;
      of the Luci program (see NCT04616794). In this 24-week study, participants are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the Luci Intervention group or to the Waiting-list Control group (i.e.,&#xD;
      participants receive the program after the end of the trial). Assessments will be done at&#xD;
      study entry (T1), week 12 (T2), and week 24 (T3).&#xD;

    <description>The Luci intervention is a personalized behaviour change program delivered via an interactive mobile platform with the online support of a coach. It targets 3 lifestyle domains: physical activity, healthy diet and cognitive engagement.&#xD;
Participants in this group will be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle, as a means for cognitive decline/dementia risk reduction. This will be achieved by providing educational materials, practical tips and strategies, and by assisting participants outlining goals to progressively adopt and maintain a healthier lifestyle.&#xD;
Coaching sessions will be held on a weekly basis from week 1 to 12, and every 2 weeks from week 13 to 24.</description>
