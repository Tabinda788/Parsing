    <description>Part A:In this stage, 3 dose groups will be preliminarily set up: the dose of Toripalimab is fixed as 240mg, intravenous infusion, Q3W. The dose of JS002 injection is fixed at 75mg,150mg and 300mg subcutaneously, and the dose was escalated by traditional 3+3 method for Q3W. 21 days after the first administration was the DLT observation period, which may be based on the obtained safety pharmacokinetics (PK).&#xD;
Part B:Based on the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy data of Part A subjects, the dosage of Part B will be determined to among advanced tumor patients who had received at least first-line therapy. According to the tumor types, 2-3 groups are preset, and about 30 subjects will be included in each group (the specific number and cohort will be adjusted according to the research progress). Toripalimab drug substance is a humanized modified IgG4κ mAb specific against human PD-1.</description>
