  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an inpatient, single-blind, non-randomized, 1-sequence study involving healthy&#xD;
      subjects who have used opioids for recreational use. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      establish the pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine 30 mg when administered with and without&#xD;
      CBD 350 mg b.i.d. and CBD 700 mg b.i.d.&#xD;
