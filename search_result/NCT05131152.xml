  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the law of changes in ocular surface inflammation when 0.05% cyclosporine eye&#xD;
      drops (II) is used to treat dry eye, 50 cases of mild to moderate dry eyes were included. The&#xD;
      expectation is finding out whether cyclosporine has a regulatory effect on conjunctival&#xD;
      microvascular parameters and other inflammation indicators after cyclosporine eye drops treat&#xD;
      dry eye, and analyze the value of conjunctival microvascular indicators in dry eye&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a common ocular surface disease that affects people's visual function and quality&#xD;
      of life. In recent years, with the changes of lifestyles, the prevalence of dry eye is&#xD;
      gradually increased. According to the consensus definition of Chinese dry eye experts in&#xD;
      2020, dry eye is a chronic ocular surface disease caused by multiple factors, while&#xD;
      inflammation is emphasized as an important role in the occurrence and development of dry eye.&#xD;
      Therefore, in addition to use artificial tears to alleviate the symptoms of dry eye, it is&#xD;
      clinically recommended to combine low-concentration ocular surface hormones or&#xD;
      immunosuppressant for anti-inflammatory therapy. As an immunosuppressant, cyclosporine can&#xD;
      inhibit the infiltration of CD4+ T cells on the ocular surface, inhibit the apoptosis of&#xD;
      conjunctival goblet and lacrimal gland acinar cells, and effectively alleviate ocular surface&#xD;
      inflammation. In addition, cyclosporine can inhibit the calcineurin pathway by forming an&#xD;
      intracellular complex with cyclophilin, promote the production of tears, and increase the&#xD;
      density of goblet cells. Cyclosporine has an impact on many molecules in the immune pathway&#xD;
      of dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, how to use and adjust immunosuppressant according to the ocular surface inflammation&#xD;
      still depends on the subjective experience of doctors, and there is no uniform standard.&#xD;
      Therefore, finding biological reference indicators for ocular surface inflammation is the key&#xD;
      to promoting the standardization and precision of anti-inflammatory drugs. The stimulation of&#xD;
      inflammation factors can lead to the expansion of the capillary network, thus, the function&#xD;
      of ocular surface capillaries can be used as an important indicator of ocular surface&#xD;
      inflammation. Now, the intelligent analysis technology based on ocular surface micro vessels&#xD;
      owned by my research team can clearly obtain blood flow imagines and topographic maps of&#xD;
      blood vessel distribution in conjunctival micro vessels, and quantify the changes in&#xD;
      microvascular shape, density and complexity, which is a kind of non-contact and convenient&#xD;
      evaluation method. In our previous studies, it was confirmed that the treatment of moderate&#xD;
      to severe dry eye with low concentrations of ocular surface hormones can cause changes of&#xD;
      ocular surface microvascular parameters. We hope to further observe the temporal and spatial&#xD;
      changes of ocular surface microvascular function during the treatment of dry eye with&#xD;
      cyclosporine, and correlation with inflammatory cells, inflammatory factors and&#xD;
      neuroinflammation, explore the effect of the drug on dry eye related inflammation target&#xD;
      issues and the guiding value of conjunctival microvascular indicators in dry eye&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy, in order to change the previous dry eye anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      treatment and the mode of medication based on the doctor's personal experience.&#xD;
