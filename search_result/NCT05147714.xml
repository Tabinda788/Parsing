  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management has an important role in anesthesia practice. In order to&#xD;
      ensure postoperative patient comfort, postoperative rehabilitation should start early and be&#xD;
      managed effectively1. It is known that if adequate analgesia is not provided before the&#xD;
      patient wakes up, the severity of pain and the total opioid consumption increases. This&#xD;
      increased opioid use causes complications such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased&#xD;
      sleepiness and respiratory depression2. For this reason, the provision of adequate analgesia&#xD;
      before the patient is awakened from general anesthesia has an important place in the process.&#xD;
      Measurement of pain has different characteristics in patients under sedation or general&#xD;
      anesthesia compared to conscious patients. However, since it is not possible for the patient&#xD;
      to define pain under general anesthesia, different measurement and evaluation methods are&#xD;
      needed. In order to monitor the intraoperative balance between nociception and&#xD;
      antinociception, several non-invasive methods with different physiological approaches have&#xD;
      been researched and made available for use in the last decade. The aim of these methods is&#xD;
      individualize the intraoperative and postoperative opioid dose3. In this context, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that the Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) method can be used in the evaluation of the&#xD;
      analgesic component of anesthesia.&#xD;

      After arrival in the operating room, patients were monitored with electrocardiogram (ECG),&#xD;
      non-invasive arterial pressure measurement, pulse oximetry, neuromuscular monitoring (GE&#xD;
      Datex, Ohmeda TOF module), entropy (GE Datex, Ohmeda Entropy Module) and SPI. Intravenous&#xD;
      midazolam (0.03-0.05 mg/kg), fentanyl (1mcg/kg) were used before induction of anaesthesia.&#xD;
      For anesthetic induction, propofol was administered until the entropy value fell below 60,&#xD;
      followed by rocuronium was performed intravenous 0.6mg/kg. Patients were intubated with&#xD;
      endotracheal tube than the mechanical ventilation was initiated with a mixture of O2 and air&#xD;
      with FiO2 0.5 and adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO2 pressure of 35 and 40 mmHg. Intravenous&#xD;
      propofol and remifentanil infusion were used for anesthesia maintenance and entropy was&#xD;
      maintained below 60. Furthermore, SPI was maintained below 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenoxicam 20 mg, paracetamol 1 g and 0.5 mg/kg tramadol intravenously were administered 30&#xD;
      minutes before the end of the surgery to each patient who had no contraindications. After the&#xD;
      last suture, the anesthetic agents were stopped and was considered the end of the surgery.&#xD;
      Then SPI data were recorded at one-minute intervals during the last five minutes (6 times in&#xD;
      total) until the entropy value reached 60. Patients who has cooperation were extubated and&#xD;
      taken to the recovery room. The first time that the patients cooperated in the recovery room&#xD;
      was considered as the zeroth minute. During the postoperative observation, the patient's pain&#xD;
      score was questioned using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) every five minutes. If NRS≥4,&#xD;
      intravenous tramadol 10 mg (100 mg as the maximum dose) was administered to the patient. The&#xD;
      patient was followed in the recovery room for 30 minutes and until NRS &lt;4. However, if NRS≥4&#xD;
      was still present at the end of the observation period, an additional 2 mg dose of morphine&#xD;
      was administered. The maximum dose of morphine was determined as 0.1mg/kg.&#xD;
