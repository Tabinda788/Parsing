    <textblock>
      Data of all patients treated with the combination of two biologicals in four Finnish tertiary&#xD;
      centres were collected and analysed. Inclusion criteria were simultaneous use of two&#xD;
      biological treatments (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab or ustekinumab), age 16&#xD;
      years or over and follow-up for at least induction period after introduction of second&#xD;
      biological therapy. The primary outcome was effectiveness, defined as remission assessed by&#xD;
      physician after at least four months of DBT. The secondary outcome was safety defined by any&#xD;
      adverse events or infection complications during DBT.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical response</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>In CD, clinical response was assessed using a modified Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI, omitting abdominal palpation) and clinical remission was defined as HBI&lt;5. In UC, partial MAYO score &lt;3 was cut the off value for clinical remission. Patients symptoms were assessed at baseline, 4, 12 and 18 months after initiation of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopic response</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic response was assessed by Mayo endoscopic score for UC, simple endoscopic score for CD based on endoscopic characteristics (MAYO ≤ 1 and SES-CD &lt; 3 as cut off values for endoscopic remission). Endoscopy was performed at baseline and 4, 12 or 18 months after initiation of treatment.</description>
