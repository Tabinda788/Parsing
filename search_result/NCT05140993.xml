  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is common and associated with significant adverse outcomes. Its&#xD;
      etiology is unknown, and little is known about associated risk factors. The investigatorea&#xD;
      aim to test whether providing emotional and orientation support can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will test whether allowing such patients to keep their&#xD;
      hearing and visual aids and be escorted into the operating room by a family member until&#xD;
      anesthesia induction reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. Delirium will be&#xD;
      actively screened as part of our institution's clinical practice starting at PACU admission&#xD;
      and for a minimum of 2 postoperative days. The investigators will use a multiple cross-over&#xD;
      design to enroll all eligible patients and alternate between the intervention and our common&#xD;
      practice (removing sensorial aids in the preoperative area and not allowing patients' escort&#xD;
      beyond that point) every 2 weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The world population is constantly growing older, and life expectancy in the western world is&#xD;
      well over 80 years. The older population suffers more severe comorbidities, yet needs more&#xD;
      surgical care. Anesthesiologists and surgeons are therefore required to care for older and&#xD;
      sicker patients, often undergoing longer and more complex procedures than in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is one of the most common adverse events experienced by hospitalized elderly&#xD;
      patients. It is defined as an acute and fluctuating state characterized by altered awareness,&#xD;
      behavior, emotional state, or thinking, and is associated with other morbidities as well as&#xD;
      with mortality. Postoperative delirium (POD) affects between 10% and 50% of elderly surgical&#xD;
      patients, depending on patients' baseline morbidities, the type of surgical procedure, and&#xD;
      the tools and criteria used for diagnosis. POD is certainly the most common postoperative&#xD;
      complication in this patient population, and is strongly associated with other postoperative&#xD;
      adverse outcomes and mortality. Many societies and task-forces now recommend routine&#xD;
      screening for cognitive decline and delirium in the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several risk factors have been identified to be independently associated with POD, such as&#xD;
      age, sex, and preoperative cognitive level. Nonetheless, most of the known risk factors are&#xD;
      not modifiable, and little is known regarding interventions that can potentially decrease the&#xD;
      risk of POD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The division of Anesthesia and Intensive Care in the Tel-Aviv Medical Center has been&#xD;
      conducting a quality improvement project since 2019, in which all surgical patients 70 years&#xD;
      or older having elective non-cardiac non-cranial surgery are screened postoperatively for POD&#xD;
      using the validated 4A's test starting in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and for at&#xD;
      least two postoperative days. The participants are also screened for preoperative cognitive&#xD;
      decline, and monitored for other significant postoperative adverse events. Nearly 2000&#xD;
      eligible patients have been analyzed to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POD incidence in our institution is over 14%, and the investigators found a strong&#xD;
      association between preoperative cognitive decline and POD, as also demonstrated by others.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the investigators also demonstrated a strong association between delirium&#xD;
      diagnosis in PACU and a later diagnosis in the surgical ward, suggesting that screening for&#xD;
      delirium as early as PACU admission is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many caregivers feel that the cognitive and emotional state in which patients are during&#xD;
      induction of general anesthesia has a great impact on their immediate recovery. Frail and&#xD;
      elderly patients are probably even more sensitive to this effect. Our common clinical routine&#xD;
      while caring for adult surgical patients is to have a family member or friend escorting&#xD;
      patients into the preoperative admission area, but not into the operating room. Similarly,&#xD;
      our nursing practice includes the removal of hearing and visual aids prior to entry into the&#xD;
      operating room. Since older patients are more prone to POD, the negative impact of separating&#xD;
      them from their emotional and orientation support is presumably significant. In contrast, it&#xD;
      is very common to have a family member escorting pediatric patients into the operating room&#xD;
      and supporting them until anesthesia induction. The investigators previously conducted a&#xD;
      pilot feasibility project in which the investigators allowed a family member of 50 elderly&#xD;
      patients to escort them into the operating room. The investigators found that the process is&#xD;
      feasible and simple. Moreover, all participants were satisfied and reported that they would&#xD;
      be happy to use such an option in the future, and no family member was overwhelmed or had any&#xD;
      adverse event as a consequence of entering the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore wish to test the hypothesis that allowing patients 70 years or&#xD;
      older having non-cardiac non-cranial surgery to enter the operating room escorted by a&#xD;
      supporting person and keeping their hearing and visual aids until anesthesia induction&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium during the initial two postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative delirium is the most common postoperative complication in the elderly&#xD;
      population, and has major impact on length of hospitalization, and postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. There are currently no known preventive interventions to reduce this risk. The&#xD;
      investigators suggest a simple and safe logistic institutional intervention that can&#xD;
      potentially reduce this risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether emotional and orientation support provided to surgical patients over 70 years&#xD;
      of age reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium during the initial 2 postoperative&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are patients ≥ 70 years having non-cardiac non-cranial surgery who are being escorted into&#xD;
      the operating room by a supporting person and keeping their hearing and visual aids, at&#xD;
      reduced risk of postoperative delirium during the initial two postoperative days, compared to&#xD;
      the clinical routine of separating patients from such emotional and orientation support&#xD;
      before entry into the operating room?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim - to test the hypothesis that providing elderly surgical patients with emotional&#xD;
      and orientation support until anesthesia induction reduces the risk of postoperative&#xD;
      delirium, compared to the clinical routine of removing such support in the preoperative&#xD;
      admission area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suggest a single-center, open-label, multiple-crossover trial in which all&#xD;
      eligible patients will be enrolled, and the intervention (providing extended emotional and&#xD;
      orientation support) will be altered every two weeks against the control, which is the&#xD;
      current clinical practice.&#xD;
