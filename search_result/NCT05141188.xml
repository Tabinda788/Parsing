    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection is among the most common nosocomial and community acquired&#xD;
      infections. The Information on prevailing levels of antimicrobial resistance among common&#xD;
      pathogens that associated with urinary tract infection is useful in making an appropriate&#xD;
      choice of empiric therapy .Resistance to antibiotic treatment in patients with urinary tract&#xD;
      infections (UTIs) is a representative example of the increasing problem of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance. Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) has emerged as an important mechanism of&#xD;
      resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.&#xD;

      Urinary tract infection is among the most common nosocomial and community acquired&#xD;
      infections. The Information on prevailing levels of antimicrobial resistance among common&#xD;
      pathogens that associated with urinary tract infection is useful in making an appropriate&#xD;
      choice of empiric therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance to antibiotic treatment in patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) is a&#xD;
      representative example of the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance.&#xD;
      Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) has emerged as an important mechanism of resistance in&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) significantly reduces the&#xD;
      efficacy of the most commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics for the empiric therapy of&#xD;
      infections caused by putative Gram-negative .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) is derived from the mutated beta-lactamase enzyme,&#xD;
      Beta-lactamase is an enzyme produced by bacteria that acts to inactivate beta-lactam class of&#xD;
      antibiotics .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase is most commonly produced by the Enterobacteriaceae group,&#xD;
      especially Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESBL-producing bacteria can also be resistant to the antibiotics class of aminoglycoside,&#xD;
      fluoroquinolone, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of ESBL-producing bacteria in an infection can result in treatment failure.&#xD;
      Antibiotic resistance causes a decrease in the effectiveness of treatment, increases&#xD;
      transmission of infection, increases mortality, and increases the cost of health care, while&#xD;
      the discovery of new antibiotics is getting less and less&#xD;

    <description>This study will be conducted on a group of patients who are diagnosed that have urinary tract infections .&#xD;
Methods of the study:&#xD;
Antibiotic susceptibility will be examined on disk diffusion test on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) . The zones of growth inhibition around each of the antibiotic disks are measured to the nearest millimeter</description>
