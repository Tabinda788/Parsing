  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pfizer - BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID - 19 vaccine is the first vaccine to be approved for&#xD;
      emergency use by FDA. The most commonly reported side effect of the BNT162b2 vaccination is&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate pain at injection site, i.e. deltoid muscle. Injection site pain may be&#xD;
      observed during and after vaccine injection, and severity of pain may vary according to the&#xD;
      type of vaccine, patients age, sex, level of anxiety, needle size, injection site and&#xD;
      technique and patient positioning. Vaccination pain is one of the reasons of vaccine&#xD;
      hesitancy and World Health Organization (WHO) recommended various measures to mitigate pain&#xD;
      at the time of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is one of the suggested methods to relieve the pain and anxiety in various&#xD;
      conditions including vaccination site pain. However, we found no studies addressing injection&#xD;
      site pain after the vaccination and pain associated with BNT162b2 vaccine. Aim of our study&#xD;
      is to evaluate effectiveness of deltoid muscle exercises to relieve injection site pain&#xD;
      observed after BNT162b2 vaccination.&#xD;

      The study was started at the designated COVID - 19 vaccination department of Bursa Yuksek&#xD;
      Ihtisas research and training hospital Approvals was obtained from Republic of Turkey&#xD;
      Ministry of Health and institutional review board and ethics committee and the study was&#xD;
      conducted in concordance with Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers were selected among the healthy persons who admitted to our vaccination department&#xD;
      to have BNT162b2 vaccine. Selection criteria were age being over 18, having no physical&#xD;
      disability to perform the physical exercises given and willingness to participate in the&#xD;
      study and sign an informed consent. People under the age of 18, patients with conditions that&#xD;
      prevent them doing the exercises given and who did not want to participate in the study were&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who accept to participate in the study, were randomized in to exercise vs.&#xD;
      no-exercise groups according to a previously formed online randomization list. All&#xD;
      volunteer's demographic data and vaccination status (first or second dose) were recorded.&#xD;
      Both groups were asked to keep a five - day pain diary using numeric rating scale (NRS) and&#xD;
      to also record any use of analgesics, any hospital admissions, any side effects other than&#xD;
      injection site and arm pain and the time of cessation of pain.&#xD;
