  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is funded by Department of Health. We will run a quitline which provides&#xD;
      telephone smoking cessation counseling to youth smokers aged 25 or below. After baseline&#xD;
      counseling based on trans-theoretical model, follow-up counseling will be provided by trained&#xD;
      counselors (i.e. nursing students or students from other healthrelated disciplines) at 1&#xD;
      week, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. It is expected that the quitline can assist youth smokers to&#xD;
      quit smoking, thus saving the healthcare cost attributed to smoking in long-term.&#xD;

      This project will last for 15 months (from 1st Dec 2020 to 28th Feb 2022). Prior to&#xD;
      commencement, a month will be spent on preparation, including setting up the quitline and&#xD;
      website, designing and printing publicity materials, connecting with secondary and&#xD;
      post-secondary schools and training peer counsellors. We will operate the quitline for 15&#xD;
      months and provide telephone counselling for eligible youth smokers. Self-reported quitters&#xD;
      at 6-month follow-up will be invited for biochemical validation.&#xD;
