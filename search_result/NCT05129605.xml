  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to define the natural history of men at high genetic risk for prostate cancer&#xD;
      on the basis of specific germline genetic mutations or a positive family history and evaluate&#xD;
      the utility of prostate MRI as a screening tool. The hypothesis is that this targeted&#xD;
      population of men are at elevated risk of developing prostate cancer compared to the general&#xD;
      population, and enhanced screening with MRI will enable early detection and diagnosis of&#xD;
      potentially aggressive prostate cancer, characterization of the penetrance of specific&#xD;
      mutations, and potentially identify new genetic risk mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths in American men. Prostate cancer has substantial inherited predisposition and men&#xD;
      harboring specific genetic variants or a positive family history have been associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Men with specific genetic variants, such as&#xD;
      pathogenic BRCA2 mutations, are at particularly greater risk of developing aggressive forms&#xD;
      of prostate cancer and thus warrant undergoing careful screening for prostate cancer.&#xD;
      However, the penetrance of many mutations in prostate cancer risk genes is unknown, and some&#xD;
      men have no identifiable mutations in known risk genes despite a strong family history of&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Prospectively collected clinical data along with biospecimens from&#xD;
      unaffected individuals at high genetic risk for developing prostate cancer will advance the&#xD;
      understanding of how specific mutations contribute to the development of prostate cancer and&#xD;
      how these prostate cancers might be best detected. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      prospectively screen men at high risk genetic risk for prostate cancer by prostate exam, PSA,&#xD;
      and prostate MRI to characterize the penetrance and cancer-related outcomes of specific&#xD;
      mutations, identify potentially novel genetic risk mutations and/or markers for early&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
