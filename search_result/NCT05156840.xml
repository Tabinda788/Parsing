  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient transitions from hospital to home have increasingly become recognized as a critical&#xD;
      opportunity to promote patient safety and high quality care, both at University of California&#xD;
      Davis Medical Center and nationwide. With over 16,000 children discharged from U.S. hospitals&#xD;
      each day and a rate of 1 in 5 experiencing adverse events related to this process, it is&#xD;
      estimated that hospital-to-home transition-related adverse events affect over 1.1 million&#xD;
      children annually. The quality of hospital discharge also affects hospital readmission rates,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, and parental satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge transition difficulties stem largely from care coordination failures throughout the&#xD;
      hospital-to-home transition. The investigators recently conducted a qualitative study&#xD;
      analyzing perspectives from parents and physicians of 20 children readmitted within 30 days&#xD;
      of hospital discharge.8 We identified a theme of caregivers having difficulty re-connecting&#xD;
      to the child's medical team for ongoing care after discharge. When problems arose, caregivers&#xD;
      reported challenges in knowing who to contact, when to reach out for help, and how to&#xD;
      navigate the health system to prevent readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of telehealth presents a unique opportunity to provide seamless follow-up for&#xD;
      families following hospital discharge. Although telehealth has not previously been studied as&#xD;
      a means of providing pediatric follow-up care after hospital discharge, similar methods of&#xD;
      providing post-discharge hospital follow-up, including nurse- or physician-led phone calls&#xD;
      and nurse home visits, were highly regarded by families, but failed to impact readmission&#xD;
      rates. Telehealth provides a unique advantage over these alternate interventions by allowing&#xD;
      face-to-face interaction via videoconference between the patient, caregiver, and hospital&#xD;
      physician, who is already familiar with the patient's disease course and overall trajectory.&#xD;
      At our site, although telehealth is readily available for use in most any clinical setting,&#xD;
      it is not commonly used for hospital discharge follow-up. Therefore, this study proposes to&#xD;
      test the feasibility of a telehealth follow-up visit for patients and their caregivers who&#xD;
      were recently discharged from a general pediatric inpatient unit.&#xD;
