  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparetic gait is characterized by strong asymmetries that could severely affect the&#xD;
      quality of life of stroke survivors. This asymmetry is due to motor deficits in the paretic&#xD;
      leg and the resulting compensations in the non-paretic limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of actively promoting gait&#xD;
      symmetry in hemiparetic patients by assessing the motion and muscular activity of both&#xD;
      paretic and non-paretic lower limbs. To this end, the investigators use a unilateral active&#xD;
      Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis able to assist the paretic limb of hemiparetic patients during gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system is able to synchronize its action with the movement of the unassisted joints,&#xD;
      promoting a natural and intuitive interaction. The device generates assistance to induce a&#xD;
      healthy gait pattern on the paretic leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a proper and natural interaction between the user and the exoskeleton&#xD;
      would enable the patients to consider the robot action as a part of their own gait&#xD;
      capability, improving their gait quality as consequence. Hemiparetic asymmetry is not only&#xD;
      due to impairments in the affected limb, but also it is the consequence of biomechanical&#xD;
      compensatory mechanisms that might arose in the non-paretic leg. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the adaptation process of the subject to the exoskeleton assistance, and to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of such human-robot interaction in both paretic and non-paretic legs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      - Materials: The investigators have developed a Knee-Ankle-Foot orthosis (KAFO) composed of&#xD;
      two joints aligned to the knee and ankle of the user. The length of its bars and the&#xD;
      positions of its braces can be tailored to the anthropometry of different users. The knee&#xD;
      joint is actuated by a DC brushless motor EC-60 flat 408057 (Maxon ag, Switzerland) coupled&#xD;
      with a harmonic drive CSD-20-160-2AGR (Harmonic Drive LLC, EE.UU.). The transmission ratio of&#xD;
      1:60 of this system enables the application of a mean torque of 35Nm. The ankle joint of the&#xD;
      prototype remains non-actuated and unlimited, enabling its free movement in the sagittal&#xD;
      plane. The total weight of the KAFO is about 4kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prototype is equipped with sensors that provide information on system variables that are&#xD;
      used for its control in real-time, such as the flexion angle of the robot joint or the&#xD;
      interaction torque between user and robot. In addition, the gait kinematic of the user is&#xD;
      measured by Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and the contact of both feet with the floor by&#xD;
      Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system uses an Adaptive Frequency Oscillator to estimate the continuous gait phase of the&#xD;
      contralateral limb and synchronically assists the paretic leg by inducing a healthy gait&#xD;
      pattern. The action of the robot depends on the gait phase of the assisted leg: during the&#xD;
      stance phase, the robot reinforces the limb so the system composed of the leg and the&#xD;
      exoskeleton can load the user's weight and not collapse, while during the swing phase the&#xD;
      robot guides the limb's movement according to the Assisted-As-Needed (AAN) paradigm creating&#xD;
      a force tunnel around the prescribed trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental protocol is divided in three sessions. During all of them, the patient will&#xD;
      walk on a treadmill commanded by the physiotherapist while wearing a safety harness to avoid&#xD;
      falls and while wearing the robotic exoskeleton in the paretic leg. During the second and&#xD;
      third sessions, electromyography will also be acquired by using surface electrodes (Trigno&#xD;
      System, Delsys Inc.) and according to the SENIAM guidelines. The muscle activity of Rectus&#xD;
      Femoris, Biceps Femoris Long Head, Tibialis Anterior and Medial Gastrocnemius of both legs&#xD;
      will be measured through this method. Each experimental session is described next:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Training session: The patient will wear the robotic exoskeleton to familiarize with&#xD;
           the action of the device. Comfortable and maximum velocities will be identified for each&#xD;
           subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Ramp Velocity Session: the session will be divided into five trials: (a) Pre, the&#xD;
           patient will not wear the device; (b) Free, the patient will wear the robot but it is&#xD;
           mechanically decoupled so it will enable the free knee movement; (c) Active, the robot&#xD;
           will assist the gait until 75% maximum gait velocity ; (d) MaxActive, the robot will&#xD;
           assist the gait until maximum gait velocity ; and (e) Post, the patient will repeat the&#xD;
           Pre condition. Velocity will increase from a comfortable velocity to the maximum and&#xD;
           then come back to the comfortable one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Random Velocity session: the session will be divided into the same trials than the&#xD;
           Ramp Velocity Session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between RampVel and RandomVel sessions will be the sequence of gait speeds at&#xD;
      which the patient will walk. During RampVel, five velocity steps will be defined from&#xD;
      comfortable to maximum velocity with or without exo (depending on the trial) and coming back&#xD;
      to comfortable velocity. During RandomVel, the same range of velocity will be used, but&#xD;
      defining five steps in the whole range and setting them in a random order. In both sessions,&#xD;
      each gait speed step will last one minute, therefore, all trials will last five minutes.&#xD;
      Trials Free, Active and MaxActive will be also randomly ordered in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between trials, patients will rest during 10 minutes to avoid summation effects. Each session&#xD;
      will occur in different days, leaving 1 or 2 days in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Intervention providers A physiotherapist and an engineer will be present during the trials.&#xD;
      The first will be responsible of assessing the basal gait of the subjects and evaluating&#xD;
      his/her state while the assistance is provided. The engineer will be responsible of managing&#xD;
      the device and recording the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both researchers monitor fidelity to the intervention by direct supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modes of delivery The protocol is provided to one participant at a time. Each patient&#xD;
           completes the protocol once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location Hospital Beata María Ana (Madrid, Spain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tailoring and modifications The protocol remains unaltered across applications. The only&#xD;
           adaptation to patients is the choice of the comfortable and maximum gait speeds for the&#xD;
           trials.&#xD;
