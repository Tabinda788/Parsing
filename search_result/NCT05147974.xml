  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of the Young Adult Clinic (YAC) study is to evaluate the DOZE app, a&#xD;
      digital, transdiagnostic behavioral sleep medicine and self-management approach in young&#xD;
      adult patients (ages 18-25) with chronic pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep, activity, and pain interactions have the potential to impact almost all important&#xD;
      protective and regulatory processes in the body. Long-term sleep disruption is associated&#xD;
      with increased pain sensitivity, prolonged pain duration, and development of chronic pain.&#xD;
      Degree of pain relief can directly impact the quality and disruption of sleep, mood,&#xD;
      behavior, social participation, and has a devastating impact on Health Related Quality of&#xD;
      Life (HRQL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transdiagnostic behavioral sleep medicine and self-management is a behavioral modification&#xD;
      approach and is currently a frontline therapy like Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia&#xD;
      (CBTi) in adults with sleep disorders. However, it is still in early stages of development&#xD;
      for adolescent and young adult populations, and less so for youth with co-morbid mental and&#xD;
      physical health conditions and chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: Assess the feasibility of implementing the DOZE app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . To examine the variance in effectiveness outcomes, including sleep health, pain, and&#xD;
           overall Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . To determine the required sample size for a future definitive trial.&#xD;

    <description>Complete DOZE app: Delivering Online &quot;ZZZ's with Empirical support (DOZE) app plus a Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD).&#xD;
The DOZE app, is a web-based app optimized for desktop, smartphone, or tablet use. It is a self-management program for adolescents and young adults with sleep problems. The intervention will be delivered on restricted password-protected applications that will allow tracking of adherence (number of logins to app and website using Google Analytics). Participants will be encouraged to log onto the sleep dairy (via automated alerts) once a day over a 10-week period to complete sleep diary entries, develop and track their goals, and receive sleep health education/tailored sleep health interventions.&#xD;
1-week pre- and post- intervention, participants will complete a battery of baseline study questionnaires and have the option of using a Geneactiv actigraphy device along with a CSD.</description>
