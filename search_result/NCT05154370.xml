  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system (CNS) idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IDD) are mainly&#xD;
      diseases caused by autoimmune factors that result in CNS demyelination damage and loss. It&#xD;
      tends to accumulate in the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. Multiple sclerosis (MS),&#xD;
      clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), myelin&#xD;
      oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) and acute disseminated&#xD;
      encephalomyelitis (ADEM) are all common IDDs of the CNS.This study will establish a large&#xD;
      prospective cohort study database of Chinese IDD, which will record detailed electronic&#xD;
      information on IDD patients, including demographic and socioeconomic data, medical history,&#xD;
      clinical information, medication, and relevant examination results. The long-term&#xD;
      observational study will be used to understand the natural history of disease, disability&#xD;
      progression rates, imaging and biological indicators, long-term treatment approaches and&#xD;
      prognosis of Chinese patients with IDD, to find predictive markers for IDD progression and&#xD;
      prognosis, and to identify factors that influence the treatment and prognosis of patients&#xD;
      with IDD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large prospective cohort studies allow long-term observation and analysis of the clinical&#xD;
      status and disease activity of IDD patient populations, and are the best way to understand&#xD;
      IDD's natural course, clinical outcome, and drug efficacy in specific populations. Globally,&#xD;
      several large prospective follow-up cohort studies have been conducted, providing important&#xD;
      information on the disease characteristics of IDD patients. However, there is no large&#xD;
      nationwide registry study of CNS IDD in China, and therefore there is a relative lack of data&#xD;
      on the natural course of disease and drug efficacy in the Chinese IDD patient population, as&#xD;
      well as a lack of standardized follow-up management of Chinese IDD patients. This study will&#xD;
      establish a large prospective cohort study database of Chinese IDD, which will record&#xD;
      detailed electronic information on IDD patients. We aim to establish a national (multicenter)&#xD;
      disease registry for central nervous system idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases in&#xD;
      China, and to establish a unified standardized follow-up management process and treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for patients with IDD in China; To provide real world data on the disease status&#xD;
      of Chinese IDD patients; To understand the disease progression characteristics of IDD in&#xD;
      China;To search for biological and imaging markers that predict the relapse, progression, and&#xD;
      prognosis of IDD; to investigate the efficacy, safety, compliance and switch of different&#xD;
      disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) in the long-term treatment of Chinese patients with IDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective observational (non-interventional) national multicenter cohort&#xD;
      study to collect clinical data from IDD patients who have signed informed consent, to&#xD;
      routinely and regularly follow up IDD patients on multiple clinical indicators, and to assess&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.All information is to be completed prospectively from the time point the&#xD;
      patient visited the hospital (except for Basic patient information and information about&#xD;
      previous disease that are required at enrollment follow-up).Once the project started, the&#xD;
      study sites are not allowed to discontinue the study on their own until the end of study is&#xD;
      announced. In addition, to ensure the continuity of the data, each site needs to appoint&#xD;
      designated clinical data collectors to collect data from qualified inpatient clinical cases&#xD;
      consecutively, so as to ensure the consecutive registration of each inpatient case who meets&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the purpose of this study is to establish a national multicenter disease registry to&#xD;
      provide disease-related information on patients with IDD in China, and the primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints of the study being descriptive endpoints, therefore no formal calculation&#xD;
      of sample size is needed. 10000 IDD patients are planned to be recruited.&#xD;
