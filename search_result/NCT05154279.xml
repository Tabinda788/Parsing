      Our study aims to evaluate the efficacy of intramyometrial injection of Terlipressin versus&#xD;
      intramyometrial injection of Carbetocin on hemoglobin level in women undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      myomectomy. Moreover, to evaluate their efficacy in decreasing blood loss on operative time&#xD;
      and to describe the injection sequelae for the same population. This clinical study will be&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with the clinical study protocol and applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fibroids are firm benign tumors that are made of smooth muscle cells and fibrous connective&#xD;
      tissue. Benign uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common pelvic tumor in women,&#xD;
      affecting 20-40% of all women over the age of 35 and 50% of African American women.&#xD;
      Approximately 20-40% of women with fibroids experience significant symptoms and consult&#xD;
      gynecologic care. However, their true prevalence is probably underestimated (1,2). The most&#xD;
      common clinical symptoms include abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain,&#xD;
      infertility, and recurrent pregnancy loss (3-5). Less commonly, women with a uterine mass&#xD;
      presumed to be a leiomyoma are found to have a uterine sarcoma or a leiomyoma variant (6,7)&#xD;
      Although hysterectomy is the definitive treatment for myomas, myomectomy remains the&#xD;
      gold-standard treatment for women wishing to preserve their uterus and fertility (8).&#xD;
      However, bleeding is often a problem in a myomectomy and can result in intra-operative&#xD;
      hypovolaemic shock, post-operative anemia, and delayed recovery (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three common causes of increased blood loss during abdominal myomectomy are poor surgical&#xD;
      technique, the complexity of intra-abdominal pathology (such as low corpus, intra-&#xD;
      ligamentous myomas, or obliteration of culde-sac), and the excessive loss of intrauterine&#xD;
      blood during dissection of the myomas (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatments for uterine fibroids are many, medical as progesterone's and&#xD;
      progesterone antagonist's, surgical, and recent myoma therapies as uterine artery&#xD;
      embolization, but surgical resection is still the main treatment, including hysterectomy and&#xD;
      myomectomy. With hysterectomy, uterine fibroids can be completely cured, but it cannot keep&#xD;
      women's reproductive functions. Despite the rate of relapse, myomectomy is still the most&#xD;
      popular surgical treatment for fibroids in women (4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A myomectomy excises the fibroid(s) and repairs any defect in the uterine wall, while&#xD;
      preserving the uterus. For this reason, myomectomy is an option for women who desire future&#xD;
      pregnancies or who wish to retain their uterus. After myomectomy, fibroids could recur, which&#xD;
      could lead to subsequent intervention(s) (11). A laparoscope can be used to remove the&#xD;
      fibroid(s) through small incisions in the abdominal wall (laparoscopic) or a hysteroscope can&#xD;
      be used to reach the fibroid(s) through the cervix (hysteroscopic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although laparoscopic myomectomy has been performed since Semm and colleagues described the&#xD;
      procedure in late 1970s (12), the role of laparoscopic myomectomy as a treatment option for&#xD;
      symptomatic uterine fibroids has been questioned. Many fibroids that can be easily removed&#xD;
      laparoscopically may not require surgical intervention (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic myomectomy was given lukewarm support in the May 2000 American College of&#xD;
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines (20): The two major concerns with&#xD;
      laparoscopic myomectomy versus hysterectomy are the removal of large myomas through small&#xD;
      abdominal incisions and the repair of the uterus. The introduction of more efficient&#xD;
      morcellators has made the removal easier, although skilled operative technique is necessary&#xD;
      because injury to other organs is possible (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are multiple techniques available for laparoscopic suturing, there is&#xD;
      controversy as to whether the closure techniques available are equal to those achieved at&#xD;
      laparotomy. This is most relevant to women contemplating a future pregnancy. In spite of&#xD;
      these reservations, recently published studies indicate that laparoscopic myomectomy may be&#xD;
      an appropriate alternative to abdominal myomectomy in well selected patients. Many&#xD;
      reproductive surgeons have the prerequisite skills to perform laparoscopic myomectomy, and&#xD;
      advances in instruments and techniques have made this approach more accessible to physicians&#xD;
      and patients (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cosmetic consideration and postoperative recovery is always a concern, which results in the&#xD;
      request of minimally invasive procedures (14). Following the initial application of&#xD;
      laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) in 1979 by Semm (15), this minimally invasive technique has&#xD;
      become more and more popular worldwide. Conventionally, a three- to four-port wound technique&#xD;
      is applied for LM. The main trocar (10 mm port) is inserted through the umbilicus to&#xD;
      introduce the video system after pneumoperitoneum insufflation with carbon dioxide. Other&#xD;
      two- or three-accessory trocars (5mm port or 10mm port) were inserted into the abdomen over&#xD;
      the left lower quadrant, right lower quadrant, and suprapubic area, for the operative&#xD;
      instruments and the suction irrigator machine (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As hemorrhage is the main complication so, reduction of intra-operative bleeding has become a&#xD;
      major concern. This can be achieved by the use of mechanical or pharmacologic methods, which&#xD;
      can be done pre-operative and intra-operative. Mechanical methods include the use of&#xD;
      tourniquets and clamps that occlude the uterine blood supply to reduce blood loss during&#xD;
      myomectomy. Pharmacologic methods include local Oxytocin injection, vasoconstrictors like&#xD;
      Vasopressin (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative uterine artery embolization decreases blood loss during myomectomy, but this&#xD;
      technique is restricted to particular hospital centers and can be complicated (14).&#xD;
      Laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion has been described as a treatment for symptomatic&#xD;
      myomas (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbetocin is an Oxytocin derivative exerting effect via the same molecular mechanisms as&#xD;
      Oxytocin. It was first described in 1987 and is a long-acting synthetic analog of Oxytocin,&#xD;
      with agonist action. The clinical and pharmacological properties of Carbetocin are similar to&#xD;
      those of naturally occurring Oxytocin. Its intravenous half-life is 85 to 100 min which is 10&#xD;
      times longer than that of oxytocin. It has a rapid onset and long-lasting action (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbetocin and uterine oxytocin receptors in the uterus caused rhythmic contraction, which&#xD;
      can increase the frequency of existing contractions as well as uterine tone. During surgery,&#xD;
      the uterine smooth muscles were made to contract so that the tumor protrudes from the uterine&#xD;
      surface and the level of the tumor cavity would be easy to find and peel (3). Carbetocin&#xD;
      functions as an agonist at peripheral Oxytocin receptors, particularly in the myometrium,&#xD;
      resulting in rhythmic contractions of the uterus, increased frequency of existing&#xD;
      contractions, and increased uterine tone (18) Terlipressin (triglycyl-lysine vasopressin)&#xD;
      became popular in the early 1990s because it has a prolonged duration of action. It is a&#xD;
      prodrug and is converted to the lysine vasopressin in the circulation after the N-triglycyl&#xD;
      residue is cleaved by endothelial peptidases. This results in a 'slow release' of the&#xD;
      vasoactive lysine vasopressin (19). The effect half-life of terlipressin is 6hr. It causes a&#xD;
      prolonged reduction of portal venous pressure (mean 103 min) (20). The elimination half-life&#xD;
      of terlipressin is 50 min (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to its pronounced vasoconstrictive effect within the splanchnic circulation,&#xD;
      terlipressin is widely used to treat patients suffering from variceal bleeding during the&#xD;
      treatment of hepatorenal syndrome and catecholamine-unresponsive septic shock. Because&#xD;
      previous studies have shown a reduction of intravasation by vasopressin during hysteroscopy,&#xD;
      we think that its analog, terlipressin, should have the same effect. Terlipressin is an&#xD;
      authorized and licensed product used by many clinicians, and its efficacy is supported by&#xD;
      sufficient published evidence (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to evaluate the efficacy of intramyometrial injection of Terlipressin versus&#xD;
      intramyometrial injection of Carbetocin on hemoglobin level in women undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      myomectomy. Moreover, to evaluate their efficacy in decreasing blood loss on operative time&#xD;
      and to describe the injection sequelae for the same population. This clinical study will be&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with the clinical study protocol and applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
