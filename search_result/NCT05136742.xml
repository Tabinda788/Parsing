      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to determine the effect of aerobic exercise training and diet on sex hormones , insulin&#xD;
      resistance and depression and if is there correlation between these factors effect in&#xD;
      postmenopausal obese women&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice of regular physical activity is recommended worldwide by different public health&#xD;
      agencies for primary or secondary prevention of many health problems, including cancers. In&#xD;
      particular, physical activity is associated with a 25 % reduction in the average risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases among women, and this protective effect appears to be independent of&#xD;
      menopausal status. Many interrelated biological mechanisms may underlie this association,&#xD;
      such as the effect of physical activity on glucose metabolism, inflammation, immune function,&#xD;
      and sex hormones. Indeed, endogenous sex hormones, particularly estrogens, seem to be&#xD;
      involved in the initiation, promotion, and progression of tumors. Prolonged exposure to high&#xD;
      endogenous hormone levels is considered one of the main risk factors for female breast&#xD;
      cancer, with a relative risk of 2.00 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.47-2.71) for&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with the highest estradiol levels . Several observational studies have&#xD;
      found an inverse association between physical activity and circulating estrogen levels . This&#xD;
      effect may be mediated by the decrease in fat mass, the main source of estrogens in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women. It may also be mediated by the disruption of the menstrual cycle before&#xD;
      menopause , especially when exercise is associated with low energy intakes. However, the&#xD;
      assessment of the exposure to physical activity remains imprecise, because it is generally&#xD;
      only possible to measure it in naturally living subjects using questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      may have no Correlation between sex hormones and insulin resistance and depression in&#xD;
      response to exercise and diet in postmenopausal obese women&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there Correlation between sex hormones and insulin resistance and depression in response&#xD;
      to exercise and diet in postmenopausal obese women?&#xD;

      It is an interventional study in which 60 women estimated to enrol according to random&#xD;
      allocation and assigned into two groups equal. The study group will receive aerobic exercises&#xD;
      in addition to diet recommendations while the control group will receive diet&#xD;
      recommendations. the aerobic exercises in form of treadmill training intensity of exercises&#xD;
      high intensity, target heart rate (THR) will be60-70% of heart maximum (HR MAX)time of&#xD;
      session 40 min initial 10 min warm up exercises on treadmill in low intensity and active&#xD;
      phase20- 30 min intensity will increase until patient reach to THR then intensity decrease&#xD;
      until session will be ended by cooling down phase for 10 min . The volunteers will perform&#xD;
      exercises 3 times per week for 12 weeks .insulin resistance will be measured by HOMA -IR&#xD;
      index and sex hormones (estridol ,testosterone. sex hormone binding globin ) pre and post&#xD;
      intervention and use zung self-rating depression scale to assess depression&#xD;
