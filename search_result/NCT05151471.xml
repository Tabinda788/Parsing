      To evaluate and compare the efficacy of two dosing regimens of oral edaravone in subjects&#xD;
      with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), based on the time from the randomization date in&#xD;
      Study MT-1186-A02 to at least a 12-point decrease in Revised ALS Functional Rating Score&#xD;
      (ALSFRS-R) or death, whichever happens first, over the course of the study or until oral&#xD;
      edaravone is commercially available in that country&#xD;
